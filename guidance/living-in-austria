<p>You must register with the Austrian authorities if you want to stay in Austria. You need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get a registration certificate (Anmeldbescheinigung) within 4 months of arriving in Austria</li>
  <li>get a residence registration form (Meldezettel) within 3 days of moving into your new home</li>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, you must apply for a new residence permit within 6 months of the day the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>If there are further changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<p>Austrian authorities require a criminal records check to be carried out if you apply for permanent residence. They generally accept records which are not older than six months.</p>

<h3 id="apostille">Apostille</h3>

<p>According to guidance from the Austrian government, an apostille (official certification of authenticity) for British documents such as a birth certificate will not be necessary in most cases. However, local authorities have the discretion to assess individual cases. You should check with your local authority (BezirksverwaltungsbehÃ¶rde).</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Austria</a>.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/austria">travel advice for Austria</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/austria/email-signup">sign up to email alerts for up-to-date travel information</a> on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If you are a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national resident in Austria and thereâ€™s no deal, the Austrian government strongly advise that you <a rel="external" href="https://www.federal-chancellery.gv.at/travelling">start your application for new residency documents</a> before you travel outside the country. After you apply, you will receive an A4 application certificate to use as proof of residence when re-entering Austria. These application certificates will only be issued from the day the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.</p>

<p>If you are travelling outside Austria before Brexit and returning after, you must bring credible evidence of your residence status when re-entering Austria. This could be residence documentation such as an Anmeldebescheinigung, MeldebestÃ¤tigung (Meldezettel), or other relevant documentation such as a Studienbescheinigung (proof of study), work contract or other relevant document. You will only be able to prove residence in this way in exceptional cases and for a limited period of time, if you have been unable to apply for new residence documentation prior to travel. The Austrian government strongly suggests that you start your application for a new residency document as soon as you have the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or EFTA country, within a 180-day period. You must retain evidence of travel (such as train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. During this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://www.migration.gv.at/en/living-and-working-in-austria/health/health-insurance/">register for healthcare</a> as a resident in Austria. Unless you have private insurance or your healthcare is paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, you should pay contributions for medical care to a <a rel="external" href="https://www.sozialversicherung.at/cdscontent/?portal=esvportal&contentid=10007.754316&viewmode=content#MainAssociationofAustrianSocialSecurityInstitutions754316">local social insurance organisation</a> (SozialversicherungstrÃ¤ger). Your employer will normally deduct health insurance contributions from your salary and make the payments on your behalf.</p>

<p>Read the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> guidance on who can <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-austria/">access healthcare in Austria and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Austria and receive an exportable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You must apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Austria, you should not use a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for healthcare in Austria.</p>

<p>When you travel from Austria for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) country or Switzerland, you can use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">read our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#brexit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>

</ul>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.aerztekammer.at/arztsuche">find an English-speaking doctor</a> by region in Austria. You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.praxisplan.at/">search for an English-speaking doctor in Vienna</a>. Find a list of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/austria-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">English-speaking medical facilities and practitioners in Austria</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a>.</p>

<p>Mountain rescue is not covered by standard Austrian health insurance.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Austria and have statutory or voluntary health insurance from an Austrian provider (Krankenkasse), your access to healthcare will not change.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, your Austrian-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> (E-Card) may no longer be valid for trips to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You must purchase travel insurance for travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and other non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/EFTA countries.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal and you do not have statutory or voluntary health insurance from an Austrian insurer (Krankenkasse), your access to healthcare may change significantly. You must take action now to confirm your residency status and decide how you will ensure access to healthcare.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government has offered to continue paying the country you live in for your healthcare in the event of no deal, just as it does now. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Austria for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If thereâ€™s no deal, and an arrangement with Austria to continue reciprocal healthcare has not been reached, your S1 form will no longer be recognised in Austria. You will be able to sign up for voluntary insurance with your regional insurer (Gebietskrankenkasse) within 6 weeks of the day the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Payments will be based on income. You should <a rel="external" href="http://www.hauptverband.at/cdscontent/?contentid=10007.693717&viewmode=content">contact your regional insurer now</a> to find out what your monthly payments would be. If you register with a statutory health insurer within this 6-week period, your cover will be retrospective to ensure uninterrupted cover from the day the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. For more information read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/en/topics/brexit/family-benefits-and-child-allowances.html?lang=en">Austrian governmentâ€™s Brexit FAQs</a>.</p>

<p>On 23 September 2019 the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government announced transitional healthcare arrangements across the whole of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> if there is a no-deal Brexit. If you are an S1 form holder in Austria, you will have also been sent a letter with information about this announcement.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Austria, you should still join an Austrian statutory health insurer within 6 weeks of the day the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, irrespective of these transitional arrangements.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid in Austria if thereâ€™s no deal. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has offered to maintain the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> scheme if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, however this is reliant on Austria continuing to accept <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> EHICs.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Austria will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Austria.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a double-taxation agreement with Austria to make sure that people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>
