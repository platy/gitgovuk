<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU and provides for a deal on citizensâ€™ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the EU broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Romania at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Romania.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information</p>

<p>In the meantime, make sure you are registered as a resident in Romania. We will update this guidance as soon as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/romania/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Romania</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Romania before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en/content/registered-residence" class="govuk-link">register as a Romanian resident</a> if you want to stay in Romania for more than 3 months. You will obtain a certificate from the <a rel="external" href="http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en/content/registered-residence" class="govuk-link">General Inspectorate for Immigration (Inspectoratul Roman pentru Imigrari)</a>.</p>

<p>All UK nationals resident in Romania by 1 January 2021 will need to apply for a new residency card. The Romanian government has not confirmed the process for obtaining the new residency card, but once it is announced you must apply for the new card before 31 December 2021.</p>

<p>Read the Romanian governmentâ€™s <a rel="external" href="http://www.mae.ro/node/53172" class="govuk-link">guidance on residency for UK nationals living in Romania</a></p>

<p>We will update these pages with details of the new system as more information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-romania" class="govuk-link">sign up for email alerts</a> to this guidance.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are living in Romania or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, youâ€™ll have life-long healthcare rights in Romania as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="http://www.cnas.ro/default/index/index/lang/EN" class="govuk-link">register for healthcare</a> as a resident in Romania.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-romania" class="govuk-link">who can access healthcare in Romania and how to register</a>.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Romania and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-romania#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Romania, you must not use a UK-issued EHIC to access healthcare in Romania.</p>

<p>When you travel from Romania for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a> and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the end of the implementation period on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Romania</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Romania, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to other Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the UK and the Ireland will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-romania">Working in Romania</h2>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in Romania, you have the right to work in Romania. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in an EU country.</a></p>

<p>If you intend to work in Romania, you must register with the Romanian Office for Immigrants. You can also register as self-employed. The <a rel="external" href="http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en/content/registered-residence" class="govuk-link">General Inspectorate for Immigration</a> has more information.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for a:</p>

<h2 id="education-and-professional-qualifications">Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>If you are resident in Romania on or before 31 December 2020, your right to study will stay the same, as long as you remain resident in Romania.</p>

<h3 id="professional-qualifications">Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>If you have already been recognised by an EU country as holding valid professional qualifications, this will remain valid after 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you have not had your professional qualifications recognised, you can submit an application under the current rules until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Read the Romanian government <a rel="external" href="https://cnred.edu.ro/en/recognition-studies-european-citizens-admission-undergraduate-studies-in-Romania" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get your professional qualifications recognised</a></p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Romania to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Romania have not changed.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU or the EEA and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>
