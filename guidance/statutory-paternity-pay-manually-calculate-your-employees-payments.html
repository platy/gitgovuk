<h2>Terminology explained</h2>

<h3>Matching date (<abbr title="Matching date">MD</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The date when the adoption agency told your employee that they had been matched with a child.</p>

<h3>Matching week (<abbr title="Matching week">MW</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The week (Sunday to Saturday) when the adoption agency told your employee that they had been matched with a child.</p>

<h3>Week baby due</h3>

<p>The week in which the expected date of the baby’s birth falls, starting with the preceding Sunday and ending on the following Saturday. If the birth falls on a Sunday, that date is the first day in the week baby due.</p>

<h3>Qualifying week (<abbr title="Qualifying week">QW</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Qualifying week">QW</abbr> is the 15th week (Sunday to Saturday) before the week baby due.</p>

<h2>Before you begin</h2>

<p>Information you need to calculate your employee’s Statutory Paternity Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> — the declaration of family commitment signed by your employee — form SC3, SC4, SC5 or your own version</li>
  <li>the date your employee intends to stop work</li>
  <li>your employee’s gross pay and the dates they were paid</li>
  <li>the date your employee started working for you</li>
  <li>confirmation that your employee’s gross earnings are liable to employer’s Class 1 National Insurance contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) or would be but for their age or level of earnings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calculate Average Weekly Earnings (<abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> must include all earnings on which Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liability is due, or would be due if they were high enough. <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> entitlement depends on your employee’s <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> in a ‘relevant period’. For the tax year 2022 to 2023 the <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> must be £123 or more. Divide all the earnings paid in that relevant period by the number of days, weeks or months in that period.</p>

<h3>The relevant period (births)</h3>

<p>This is usually the 8 week period before the <abbr title="Qualifying week">QW</abbr>.</p>

<p>The end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on, or before, the Saturday of the <abbr title="Qualifying week">QW</abbr> (or the date the baby is born where the baby is born before or during the <abbr title="Qualifying week">QW</abbr>).</p>

<p>The start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.</p>

<h3>Example weekly paid employee</h3>

<p>The relevant period is 15 October 2022 to 09 December 2022.</p>

<p>Add up all the earnings paid between 15 October 2022 to 09 December 2022 and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).</p>

<p>Do not round the figure up or down to whole pence.</p>

<p>The relevant period is 1 October 2022 to 30 November 2022.</p>

<p>Add up all the earnings paid between 1 October 2022 to 30 November 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>divide by 2 (the number of months in the relevant period)</li>
  <li>multiply by 12 (number of months in the year)</li>
  <li>divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not round the figure up or down to whole pence.</p>

<h3>The relevant period (adoption)</h3>

<p>This is usually the 8 week period before the <abbr title="Matching week">MW</abbr>.</p>

<p>The end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on or before the Saturday of the <abbr title="Matching week">MW</abbr>.</p>

<p>The start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.</p>

<h3>Example weekly paid employee</h3>

<p>Matching date is 8 December 2022:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>The relevant period is 5 October 2022 to 9 December 2022.</p>

<p>Add up all the earnings paid during the relevant period and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).</p>

<p>Do not round the figure up or down to whole pence.</p>

<h3>Example monthly paid employee (adoption)</h3>

<p>Matching day is 8 December 2022:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">MW</th>
      <th scope="col">Payday</th>

      <td>30 November 2022</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The relevant period is 1 October 2022 to 30 November 2022.</p>

<p>Add up all the earnings paid between during the relevant period and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>divide by 2 (the number of months in the relevant period)</li>
  <li>multiply by 12 (number of months in the year)</li>
  <li>divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not round the figure up or down to whole pence.</p>

<h3>Weekly paid employees without a whole number of weeks in the relevant period</h3>

<p>This may happen if you bring forward your employee’s normal payday because of bank holidays, for example at Easter or Christmas. Divide the earnings by the number of weeks wages actually paid, not the number of weeks in the relevant period.</p>

<h3>Employees paid multiples of a week</h3>

<p>This may happen if you pay your employee fortnightly or 4 weekly. Divide the earnings by the number of whole weeks in the relevant period.</p>

<h3>Monthly paid employees without a whole number of months in the relevant period</h3>

<p>Work out the number of rounded months as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>count the number of whole months</li>
  <li>count the numbers of odd days</li>
</ul>

<p>Round up or down as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>February — 14 days or less round down, 15 days or more round up</li>
  <li>any month except February — 15 days or less round down, 16 days or more round up</li>
</ul>

<p>Divide the earnings by this number of rounded months.</p>

<h3>Employees not paid in a regular pay pattern</h3>

<p>Divide the earnings by the number of days in the relevant period and multiply by 7.</p>

<h3>Mistimed payments</h3>

<p>This only applies to regular payments of earnings paid other than on their normal date, for example due to a bank holiday.</p>

<p>A mistimed payment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>occurs when the date of the actual payment of earnings is made earlier or later than the normal contractual payday, such as an annual holiday</li>
  <li>should not be confused with a payroll error, where a mistake is made in the payroll resulting in a shortfall of pay when working out the <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> in the relevant period</li>
</ul>

<p>Divide the total earnings in the relevant period by the number of weeks wages actually paid.</p>

<h3>Overpayment or underpayment of earnings made during the relevant period</h3>

<p>Always calculate <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> on all earnings actually paid within the relevant period. Where over or under payments of wages occur within the relevant period, include the overpaid or underpaid amount in the <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> calculation to decide if <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> is due.</p>

<h3>Salary sacrifice</h3>

<p>If an employee has entered into a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/salary-sacrifice-and-the-effects-on-paye">salary sacrifice</a> with you their <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> is calculated using the amount of earnings actually paid to them after the sacrifice during the relevant period.</p>

<h3>Contractual benefits</h3>

<p>For the purposes of calculating <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> for <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr>, the calculation is based on earnings which are subject to Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. Therefore the value of any benefits which are exempt from Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> (such as some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-childcare">childcare vouchers</a> will not be included in the <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> calculation.</p>

<h3>Earnings in the relevant period affected by a backdated pay rise</h3>

<p>If your employee receives a backdated pay rise which increases the amount of earnings already paid in the relevant period and was either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not entitled to <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>entitled to <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> at less than the standard rate</li>
</ul>

<p>You must recalculate their <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr> to check if they’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>now entitled, and pay any <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> due</li>
  <li>entitled to an increase and pay any extra <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> due</li>
</ul>

<h2>Calculate <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> is a weekly payment. It lasts for 1 or 2 complete weeks and the 2 weeks must be consecutive.</p>

<p>You must pay your employee the lower weekly rate of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£156.66 from 5 April 2022</li>
  <li>90% of their <abbr title="Average Weekly Earnings">AWE</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> period starts the day after the last day your employee worked before starting their paternity leave.</p>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> weeks start with the first day of the pay period, for example an <abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> period which starts on a Wednesday will have pay weeks within the pay period which run from Wednesday to the following Tuesday.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> paid part-weekly</h3>

<p><abbr title="Statutory Paternity Pay">SPP</abbr> can be paid as part weeks to help employers align the payments to their employee’s normal pay period. The weekly rate may be split into 2 and if it is, the calculation is done on the basis of dividing the weekly rate by 7. For example, if the pay period covers the end of one month and the beginning of the next (2 days in April and 5 days in May) then pay 2/7ths in one month and 5/7ths the next month.</p>
