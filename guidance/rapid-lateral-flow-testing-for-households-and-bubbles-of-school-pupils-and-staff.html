<p>About 1 in 3 people with coronavirus do not have symptoms but can still pass it on to others. Regular testing of people without symptoms is important to help stop the virus spreading and protect your loved ones. As lockdown restrictions gradually ease we all need to play our part to help protect each other.</p>

<p>The following people in England will have access to regular rapid lateral flow testing made available to them as schools and colleges reopen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>secondary school pupils and college students</li>
  <li><a href="#primary-or-secondary-school-staff" class="govuk-link">staff of primary and secondary schools and colleges</a></li>
  <li>households, childcare and support bubbles of primary and secondary-age pupils and college students</li>
  <li>households, childcare and support bubbles of staff of primary and secondary schools and colleges</li>
</ul>

<p>Primary school pupils will not be asked to test at this time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-lateral-flow-antigen-testing-for-people-without-symptoms" class="govuk-link">Learn what rapid lateral flow testing is and why it’s being used.</a></p>

<h2>If you have coronavirus symptoms</h2>

<p>The most important symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19, arrange to have a PCR test if you have not already had one. Stay at home while you are waiting for a home self-sampling kit, a test site appointment or a test result. Do not use the rapid lateral flow testing service as this is only for people without symptoms.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">Order a test for people with symptoms</a> online or call 119.</p>

<h2>How to get a rapid lateral flow test</h2>

<p>There are different ways to get a test for pupils, students and staff of schools and colleges, and members of their households, childcare and support bubbles in England who do not have symptoms of coronavirus.</p>

<h3>Secondary school pupils and college students</h3>

<p>Upon returning to school or college, pupils and students will be asked to take their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first 3 tests at their place of study under the supervision of a trained operator</li>
  <li>fourth test themselves using a home test kit</li>
</ul>

<p>Pupils and students will then continue taking twice-weekly tests using a home test kit provided by their school. They should report all results to NHS Test and Trace as soon as the test is completed, either online or by telephone, as set out in the home test kit instructions.</p>

<h3>Staff of primary or secondary schools and colleges</h3>

<p>Upon returning to school or college, teaching and non-teaching staff should take twice-weekly tests using a home test kit provided by their school or college. This includes permanent, temporary and voluntary staff.</p>

<p>Staff should contact their school or college for further details.</p>

<h3>Members of households, childcare or support bubbles of pupils, students and staff of schools and colleges</h3>

<p>This section does not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>secondary school pupils</li>
  <li>college students</li>
  <li>staff of schools or colleges</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Take twice-weekly tests using home test kits provided by your school or college if you’re one of these pupils, students or staff.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re a member of a household, childcare bubble of a pupil, student or staff of a school or college, you can get a twice-weekly test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>through your employer if they offer testing to employees</li>
  <li>at a local test site</li>
  <li>by collecting a home test kit from a test site</li>
  <li>by ordering a home test kit online</li>
</ul>

<h4>Get a test through your employer</h4>

<p>Your workplace may offer rapid lateral flow testing to you. Contact your employer to find out more.</p>

<h4>Take a test at a rapid lateral flow test site</h4>
<p>You can take a rapid lateral flow test at a local site. Testing at these sites is assisted, which means you will swab yourself under the supervision of a trained operator.</p>

<p>You may need to book an appointment.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://maps.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/">Find your nearest rapid lateral flow test site</a>.</p>

<h4>Collect test kits</h4>

<p>You can collect 2 packs of home test kits at a local collection point. Each pack contains 7 tests.</p>

<p>Anyone 18 or over can collect.</p>

<p>Most collection points are open from 1.30pm to 7pm. You can check online if the location is open or busy before you go. You do not need to make an appointment.</p>

<p>Do not visit a collection point outside opening hours, as it may be used to test people with coronavirus symptoms outside these times.</p>

<h4>Order home test kits online</h4>

<p>If you cannot get tested at your workplace, or are unable to go to a test site or collect test kits, you can order a home test kit online.</p>

<p>Do not order online if you can get a test through other methods. This frees up home delivery for those who need it most.</p>

</div>

<h3>What twice-weekly testing involves</h3>
<p>You will be asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a test twice a week (every 3 or 4 days apart)</li>
  <li>report every result to NHS Test and Trace on the same day you take the test</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">Report your test result online</a> or by calling 119.</p>

<p>If anyone tests positive or gets coronavirus symptoms, they should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>self-isolate immediately</li>
  <li>get a PCR test to confirm the result</li>
  <li>follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Pupils, students and staff should also tell their school or college if they test positive.</p>

<p>A negative result means the test did not find signs of coronavirus. But this does not guarantee you do not have coronavirus, so you should keep following all <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">coronavirus advice</a> including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular handwashing</li>
  <li>social distancing</li>
  <li>wearing a face covering where recommended</li>
</ul>
