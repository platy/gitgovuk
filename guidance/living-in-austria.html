</div>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>You should follow the advice of the Government of Austria and your local authority. You can also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/austria">Austria travel advice</a> for our latest guidance.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national in Austria see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/austria/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-austria">sign up for email alerts</a> to this guidance</li>
  <li>follow the British Embassy in Austria on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/ukinaustria/">Facebook</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://twitter.com/UKinAustria" class="govuk-link">Twitter</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Austria before 1 January 2021, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You must apply for a new residence status by 31 December 2021 to secure your rights. You do not need to show proof of German language skills when you apply.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Austria before 1 January 2021, you need to apply for a new ‘Article 50’ residence card.</p>

<p>In Vienna, you will need to <a href="https://www.wien.gv.at/english/administration/civilstatus/immigration/residence/brexit.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">make an appointment at the MA35 (local immigration office) in Arndtstrasse</a>.</p>

<p>In other regions, you will need to apply at your regional authority (the “Magistrat” or “Bezirkshauptmannschaft”). Use this tool to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.help.gv.at/Portal.Node/hlpd/public/content/behoerden.html" rel="external">find the responsible authority for your area</a> (in German only).</p>

<p>Check in advance if coronavirus restrictions are affecting office opening times or procedures.</p>

<p>You must apply for the card before 31 December 2021. Read the Austrian government <a rel="external" href="https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/en/topics/brexit/residency-and-access-to-the-labour-market.html" class="govuk-link">guidance on the residency registration process</a>.</p>

<h3>If you have been living in Austria for more than 5 years</h3>

<p>If you have been living in Austria continuously for more than 5 years, your ‘Article 50’ card will be valid for 10 years.</p>

<p>If you or your family members have a long-term residence certificate for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> nationals (Bescheinigung des Daueraufenthalts) or a permanent residence permit (Daueraufenthaltskarte or Daueraufenthalt-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>), you can exchange this for the new ‘Article 50’ card for free. Administrative charges might apply.</p>

<p>If you have permanent residency rights in Austria but do not have a long-term residence certificate (or pre-2006 equivalent), you may be asked to bring supporting documents to show you have been living in Austria.</p>

<p>You may also be eligible for permanent residence before 5 years, read the <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/residence-rights/workers/index_en.htm?expandable=3" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> guidance on residency rights</a>.</p>

<h3>If you have been living in Austria for less than 5 years</h3>

<p>If you have been living in Austria for less than 5 years, you will be eligible for an ‘Article 50’ residence card with 5 years’ validity. You will need to provide evidence of your personal situation (as a worker, student, self-sufficient person, British family member or British spouse of an Austrian national) and proof of comprehensive health insurance.</p>

<p>Once you have been living in Austria for 5 continuous years you will be eligible for permanent residency.</p>

<h3>Moving to Austria</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/austria/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Austria</a>. 
Read the Austrian government’s <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.help.gv.at/Portal.Node/hlpd/public/content/12/Seite.120224.html">guidance on residency permits for third country nationals</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence card, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your card, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence card, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Austria. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Austria, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Austria.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a>.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting Austria and are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.migration.gv.at/en/living-and-working-in-austria/health/health-insurance/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">register for healthcare</a> as a resident in Austria. Unless you have private insurance or your healthcare is paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, you should pay contributions for medical care to a <a href="https://www.sozialversicherung.at/cdscontent/?portal=esvportal&amp;contentid=10007.754316&amp;viewmode=content#MainAssociationofAustrianSocialSecurityInstitutions754316" class="govuk-link" rel="external">local social insurance organisation (Sozialversicherungsträger)</a>. Your employer will normally deduct health insurance contributions from your salary and make the payments on your behalf.</p>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-austria">guidance on healthcare in Austria</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> employer has sent you to Austria temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-austria#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Austria before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Austria and commutes to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-austria#s1">guidance on using an S1 in Austria</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Austria, you must not use your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for healthcare in Austria.</p>

<p>If you were living in Austria before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> student in Austria</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start">Apply now for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h2>Working in Austria</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Austria before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain resident.</p>

<p>If you are planning to come to Austria to work you may need a visa. Read the <a href="https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/en/topics/brexit/residency-and-access-to-the-labour-market.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Austrian government’s guidance on work visas</a> <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migration.gv.at/en/welcome/?no_cache=1">and migration to Austria</a></p>

</ul>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Austria and were regularly commuting to work in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or EFTA country before 1 January 2021 you may need a permit to show that you are a frontier worker. You must also apply for a residence card in Austria.</p>

<p>If you live in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or EFTA country and regularly commuted to work in Austria before 1 January 2021 you need a certificate. You should apply for a “Bestätigung gemäß § 3 Absatz 8 Ausländerbeschäftigungsgesetz für “Artikel 50 EUV – Grenzgänger und Grenzgängerinnen” certificate at the regional office of the Austrian Public Employment Service (Arbeitsmarktservice).</p>

<p>Read the Austrian government <a href="https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/en/topics/brexit/residency-and-access-to-the-labour-market.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on working in Austria</a>.</p>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>You may need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in Austria. When doing this, you will be subject to the third country regulations.</p>

<p>If you are offering a professional service in Austria and are unsure whether your qualification or professional status is currently recognised – it may not be if you are not currently an active (fee-paying) member of the relevant business chamber – find out whether you need to take any further action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.aais.at/" class="govuk-link">ENIC NARIC</a> is the information centre for the academic and professional recognition of qualifications</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="https://www.eap.gv.at/index_en.html" class="govuk-link">Austrian single point of contact for service providers</a>

<p>If your qualification was officially recognised by the relevant regulator in Austria before 1 January 2021, make sure you understand the terms of your recognition decision by checking with that regulator.</p>

<h3>Recognition of legal qualifications</h3>

<p>If you’re a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-qualified lawyer working in Austria, using either an Austrian or <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> professional title, you should contact the local Bar Association in the region in which you are working or the <a rel="external" href="https://www.rechtsanwaelte.at/en" class="govuk-link">Austrian Federal Bar Association</a> for specific advice.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a double taxation agreement with Austria to make sure that you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals living in Austria have not changed following the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s withdrawal from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>As an Austrian resident, you must declare your global income to the Austrian authorities, no matter which country it came from. You can ask the relevant tax authority about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Third-party car insurance (Haftpflichtversicherung) is compulsory in Austria.</p>

<p>If you have your main residence in Austria, you may use your car with foreign number plates for one month in Austria. You must register your car, pay a one-off fuel consumption tax called NoVA (Normverbrauchsabgabe) at your local tax office and exchange your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> number plates for Austrian plates at your nearest vehicle registration office (Kfz-Zulassungsstelle).</p>

<p>You need proof of insurance before you can get your number plates (Autokennzeichen) and car registration document (Zulassungsschein). Your insurer can advise you how to get these.</p>
