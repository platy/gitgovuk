<h2>If you were living in Finland before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you were living in Finland since before 1 January 2021. These are indicated with sub-headings.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>You should follow the advice of the Finnish Government and your local authority. You can also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland">Finland travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national in Finland, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Finland</a>.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit">Finnish Immigration Service guidance on residence permits</a>.</p>

<p>If your residence permit application is refused, you will be notified about the appeal process along with your application decision. This will include the Administrative Court you must appeal to, the deadline, what to provide and how to submit your appeal. You can remain in Finland while you wait for the Administrative Courtâ€™s appeal decision.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://migri.fi/en/appealing-a-decision" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Finnish government appeals advice</a>.</p>

<p>If you need help with your appeal, you can contact the immigration advice service provided by your local city services. The service is free and provides personal advice on residence permits. The <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pakolaisneuvonta.fi/en/legal-services/">Refugee Advice Centre also provides legal aid and advice to foreigners</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Finland before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you applied for your new residence permit (â€˜Brexit permitâ€™) by 30 September 2021, your rights are protected by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> pending a decision on your application. You should continue the process to get your Brexit permit if you do not have this yet.</p>

<p>Your Brexit permit is valid for 5 years. You must <a href="https://migri.fi/en/renewal-of-a-residence-permit-card" rel="external" class="govuk-link">renew your Brexit permit</a> before the expiry date.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://migri.fi/en/brexit/en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Finnish Immigration Service guidance</a> on Brexit permit applications.</p>

<p>If you have not had a response to your Brexit permit application, use your application number to check the status of your application online.</p>

<h3>Late applications</h3>

<p>The deadline for applying for a Brexit permit was 30 September 2021. You can still <a rel="external" href="https://migri.fi/en/-/british-citizen-the-application-period-for-brexit-permits-has-ended" class="govuk-link">apply if you have reasonable grounds for missing it</a>. You should apply as soon as possible.</p>

<p>To apply online, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/brexit/en" rel="external">Finnish Immigration Service guidance</a>. Use the additional information section to explain why your application is late. The Finnish Immigration Service will review late applications on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Finland at any point in the future. Find out who this applies to in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Apply at a Finnish embassy or an approved application centre. See the Finnish governmentâ€™s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://migri.fi/en/application-for-family-member" class="govuk-link">how to apply for residence as a family member</a>. Nationals of certain non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries may need a visa before travel.</p>

<p>You should also read the Finnish governmentâ€™s guidance for <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit-card#brexit">further information about residence permits</a>.</p>

<h3>Moving to Finland</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Finland</a> in our travel advice and read the <a rel="external" href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit" class="govuk-link">Finnish Immigration Service guidance on residence permits</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence permit, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your card, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence permit, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Finland. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Finland, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is incorrectly stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland/entry-requirements">Check the Finland travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Finland</a>.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>If you stay in Finland with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register for healthcare as a resident in Finland, as well as with The Social Insurance Institution of Finland, <abbr title="KansanelÃ¤kelaitos">Kela</abbr>. It issues the Social Security &amp; Health Insurance Card, which will give you access to healthcare on the same basis as Finnish citizens.</p>

<p>Medical treatment, medicine and hospital stays are rarely completely free of charge in Finland.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-finland" class="govuk-link">guidance on who can access healthcare in Finland</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> if you live in Finland and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are receiving a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pension</li>
  <li>are receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>are a frontier worker who lives in Finland and commutes to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have been sent to Finland temporarily by your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> employer</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-finland#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Finland</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) and Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Finland, you must not use your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC for healthcare in Finland, unless you are a student or a detached (posted) worker. Current EHICs will remain valid until the expiry date on the card.</p>

<p>If you are living in Finland you may be eligible for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> student in Finland</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p>The card you receive will depend on when you moved to Finland.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" class="govuk-link">Apply now for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC</a>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h2>Working in Finland</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Finland before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, providing you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>If you are planning to move to Finland to work, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/working-in-finland">you may need a visa</a>.</p>
