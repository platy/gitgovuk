<h2>If you were living in Finland before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Finland since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Finnish government and your local authority. You can also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland">Finland travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Finland, read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Finland</a>.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit" rel="external">Finnish Immigration Service guidance on residence permits</a>.</p>

<p>If your residence permit application is refused, you will be notified about the appeal process along with your application decision. This will include the Administrative Court you must appeal to, the deadline, what to provide and how to submit your appeal. You can remain in Finland while you wait for the Administrative Courtâ€™s appeal decision.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/appealing-a-decision" rel="external">Finnish government appeals advice</a>.</p>

<p>If you need help with your appeal, you can contact the immigration advice service provided by your local city services. The service is free and provides personal advice on residence permits. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pakolaisneuvonta.fi/en/legal-services/" rel="external">Refugee Advice Centre also provides legal aid and advice to foreigners</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Finland before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you applied for your new residence permit (â€˜Brexit permitâ€™) by 30 September 2021, your rights are protected by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a> pending a decision on your application. You should continue the process to get your Brexit permit if you do not have this yet.</p>

<p>Your Brexit permit is valid for 5 years. You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/renewal-of-a-residence-permit-card" rel="external">renew your Brexit permit</a> before the expiry date.</p>

<p>Read guidance from the Finnish Immigration Service on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/brexit/en" rel="external">Brexit permit applications</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit-card#brexit" rel="external">the Brexit permit, renewals and residence permit FAQS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have not had a response to your Brexit permit application, use your application number to check the status of your application online.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>

<p>If your application is refused, you will be notified about the appeal process. The appeal instructions will tell you which Administrative court you must appeal to, the deadline for making your appeal, any documents you must send and how to submit your appeal. Read the Finnish government advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/appealing-a-decision" rel="external">how to appeal a residency decision</a>.</p>

<p>There is usually a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://oikeus.fi/tuomioistuimet/en/index/asiointijajulkisuus/maksut.html" rel="external">fee charged for using the Administrative courts</a>.</p>

<p>Read information on what matters are dealt with by the Administrative Court, and for advice about making an appeal and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://oikeus.fi/oikeusapu/en/index.html" rel="external">availability of legal aid</a>.</p>

<p>If your appeal is rejected you may be able to apply for residence as a third country national. A third country national is someone who does not have EU, EEA or Swiss nationality.</p>

<p>You are allowed to stay in Finland for the appeal decision. If your appeal is refused, you can leave voluntarily. You are usually given 30 days to leave and can apply for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/voluntary-return" rel="external">assisted voluntary return</a>. If you do not leave voluntarily, the police or Border Guard will remove you.</p>

<h3>Late applications</h3>

<p>The deadline for applying for a Brexit permit was 30 September 2021. You can still <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/-/british-citizen-the-application-period-for-brexit-permits-has-ended" rel="external">apply if you have reasonable grounds for missing it</a>. You should apply as soon as possible.</p>

<p>To apply online, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/brexit/en" rel="external">Finnish Immigration Service guidance</a>. Use the additional information section to explain why your application is late. The Finnish Immigration Service will review each late application on an individual basis.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Finland at any point in the future. Find out who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Apply at a Finnish embassy or an approved application centre. See the Finnish governmentâ€™s guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migri.fi/en/application-for-family-member" rel="external">how to apply for residence as a family member</a>. Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Finnish authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-finland#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Finland.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Finland</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Finland travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Finland using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Finland with a Finnish residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Finland, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Finland before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your Brexit permit or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Finland, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Finland with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>
