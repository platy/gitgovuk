<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you plan to remain in Malta for more than 3 months, you must <a rel="external" href="https://identitymalta.com/citizenships-expatriates/">contact the Department of Citizenship and Expatriate Affairs</a> to apply for residency. The Malta government will issue an identity card once you are registered.</p>

<p>For information on visas and residency you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/malta/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Malta</a> in our travel advice</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Visas and residency after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You should make sure you are registered as a resident in Malta before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your rights will be recognised if you are legally resident in Malta before the end of the implementation period on 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If there are any changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-malta">sign up to email alerts</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you will need to get a new non-EU residence permit within 2 years of the UK leaving the EU. This will protect your rights, including access to healthcare, rights to work and access to social benefits. Your current EU residency document will remain valid in the meantime. 
This residency document will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>free</li>
  <li>valid for 10 years</li>
  <li>renewable when it expires</li>
</ul>

<p>If you arrive after the UK leaves the EU, you will be eligible for the 10 year residency permit as long as you satisfy the criteria. You will have to pay the same fee as third country nationals.</p>

<p>We will update this guidance when we know how and when the application process for the new residency permits will take place.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Malta</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-eu-exit">Passports and travel after EU exit</h3>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check you have enough time left on your passport to travel</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you will need at least 6 months left on your passport to travel to most countries in Europe. If you renewed your passport early, you may need more than 6 months left.</p>

<p>You can find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/passport-rules-for-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">passport rules for travel to Europe after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission has said you may not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the Schengen area or the EU. You may be able to stay for up to 90 days in any EU country, within a 180 day period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If you are legally resident in Malta, you should carry your residency permit with you when exiting or entering Malta after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/malta/health">travel advice for Malta</a></p>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/Pages/healthcareinMalta.aspx">NHS guidance about healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Malta</a></p>

<p>If you are resident in Malta, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Malta.</p>

<p>If you are legally resident in Malta, you should check if you are eligible to <a rel="external" href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/cbhc/Documents/application_form_for_rha_entitlement_card_040614_updated.pdf">apply for the Maltese RHA Entitlement Card</a> through the Maltese government website. This lets you access healthcare services in Malta.</p>

<p>RHA Entitlement Card holders are not entitled to long-term care and treatment outside Malta and are not eligible for the European Health Insurance Card from Malta. The Maltese government has <a rel="external" href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/cbhc/Pages/Entitlement/Reciprocal-Agreement-MaltaUK.aspx">more information on RHA cards</a>.</p>

<p>You can register at your <a rel="external" href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/phc/Pages/Health-Centres/Overview.aspx">nearest health centre</a> on the Maltese government website and make GP appointments. You will need to bring an identity card or passport.</p>

<p>If you are visiting Malta for 30 days or less, you may present your UK passport to access healthcare services.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-eu-exit">Healthcare after EU exit</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Malta will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Malta.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you will continue to be able to access healthcare as now. This includes those who currently access healthcare through the S1 form.</p>

<p>If you are visiting Malta for up to 30 days, you will still be able to access healthcare with a UK-issued EHIC.  We are currently working on more healthcare agreements with the Maltese government. You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.mt/mt/Pages/FACTSHEET-Malta-Government-plans-in-case-of-a-no-deal-Brexit.aspx">Maltese Government factsheet on the UK leaving the EU without a deal</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you plan to visit Malta after the UK leaves the EU, you should continue to buy <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">comprehensive travel insurance</a> to ensure your healthcare access is protected.</p>

<p>In an emergency, go directly to <a rel="external" href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/MDH/Pages/Home.aspx">Mater Dei Hospital</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/ggh/Pages/Home.aspx">Gozo General Hospital</a>.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malta-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">English-speaking doctors in Malta</a>. You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Malta.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-malta">Working in Malta</h2>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in Malta, you have the right to work in Malta. You can read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>When looking for work, you may need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records certificate</a>
</li>
  <li>visit the Maltese government website to <a rel="external" href="https://ncfhe.gov.mt/en/services/Pages/All%20Services/mqric.aspx">check if your qualifications are recognised in Malta</a>

</ul>

<h3 id="working-in-malta-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Malta after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If you are planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, you should read our further guidance.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, if you have the new non-EU residency document you will be able to work in Malta and will not need a work visa or employment licence.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Malta to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You can read guidance about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

<p>For advice on paying tax in Malta, you can find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malta-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer</a>.</p>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in Malta. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you should read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">guidance on using a bank card, insurance or other financial services</a>.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Malta. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a></p>

<p>If you retire in Malta, you can claim:</p>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">‘life certificate’ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK State Pension to those eligible after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Malta, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Maltese pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Maltese government will recognise pension contributions that were made in the UK before the UK leaves the EU. You should read the Maltese government’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.mt/mt/Pages/FACTSHEET-Malta-Government-plans-in-case-of-a-no-deal-Brexit.aspx">factsheet for more information on pensions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Malta. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our guidance on which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">benefits you can claim if you live abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">check which benefits you can claim while you’re abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit cannot be paid to you.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time you’ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="maltese-benefits">Maltese benefits</h3>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some Maltese social security benefits. You should:</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay child benefits, and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Malta, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Maltese contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Maltese government have confirmed that they will continue to take periods of work in the UK before the UK leaves the EU into account when claiming Maltese contributions-based benefits. We will continue to update our guidance on this.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-malta">Driving in Malta</h2>

<p>If you are resident in Malta, you should exchange your UK licence for a Maltese one by completing <a rel="external" href="http://www.transport.gov.mt/admin/uploads/media-library/files/DRV%2030%20Exch%20of%20DL.pdf">Transport Malta’s DRV30 Form</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Malta, you will not be able to renew a lost, stolen or expired licence with the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You should therefore exchange your licence for a Maltese one before your UK licence expires.</p>

<h3 id="driving-in-malta-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Driving in Malta after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, driving licence rules will stay the same during the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your UK driving licence will be valid for up to a year after you register as a resident in Malta. UK driving licences can be exchanged for a local Maltese one without having to retake your test.</p>

<p>You will not need an International Driving Permit if you are visiting Malta.</p>

<p>We will update this guide when more information becomes available.</p>
