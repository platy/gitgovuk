<h2>NHS COVID Pass: what it is and how to get it</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass lets you share your coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination records or test COVID-19 status in a secure way.</p>

<p>It allows you to show others the details of your COVID status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when travelling abroad to some countries or territories</li>
  <li>as a condition of entry at those venues or events that use the service in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get an NHS COVID Pass:</p>

<ul>
  <li>digitally through the NHS App or online via NHS.UK</li>
  <li>as a letter sent to you in the post</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out the eligibility requirements on the NHS website.</p>

<h2>How to use the NHS COVID Pass when travelling abroad</h2>
<p>You can show the vaccination records contained within your NHS COVID Pass as proof of your COVID status when travelling abroad.</p>

<p>You will also need to follow additional rules when travelling abroad.</p>

<p>You should register with the NHS App before booking international travel.</p>

<p>You should check that your first name and your surname on your passport match how they are displayed by your NHS COVID Pass at least 2 weeks before you travel. If the names are different, contact your GP practice to have your details updated.</p>

<p>If you have not been fully vaccinated, you should continue to follow the entry requirements of the country you are travelling to, such as proof of a negative COVID-19 test on arrival. You should carefully research the requirements of your destination country before travelling.</p>

<p>Further details on entry requirements can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">GOV.UK foreign travel advice pages</a> and on the websites of your destination country.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-abroad-from-england-during-coronavirus-covid-19">See advice about travelling abroad from England during the pandemic</a></p>

<h3>COVID booster vaccinations</h3>

<p>If you’ve received a booster vaccination it will show in your NHS COVID Pass within 5 days. You’ll see a 2D barcode for your full course of vaccinations plus your booster vaccination.</p>

<p>Your vaccinations will show in reverse order, with the most recent first. This is also the case if you download a PDF of your NHS COVID Pass for travel, or store it within the Apple Wallet or Google Pay Wallet.</p>

<p>If you’re about to travel, you should download an updated PDF version of your NHS COVID Pass, or store an updated version in your Apple Wallet or Google Pay Wallet.</p>

<p>You’ll also see your detailed booster vaccination information in the ‘View COVID-19 records’ section of the NHS COVID Pass within the NHS App and online service.</p>

<p>Some countries now require travellers to demonstrate that they have received 2 doses of a COVID-19 approved vaccination within 180 days, or a booster dose no less than 14 days before entering the country.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your NHS COVID Pass can now be scanned to check and validate your COVID status in venues in over 40 countries, including those in the EU.</p>

</div>

<h2>How to use the NHS COVID Pass at domestic venues and settings in England</h2>
<p>Some events and venues may ask you to show your NHS COVID Pass as a condition of entry.</p>

<p>Use of the NHS COVID Pass is voluntary for individual organisations in England. However, the government encourages the use of the NHS COVID Pass in facilities or events where people are likely to be in close proximity to a large number of people from other households for a sustained period of time.</p>

<p>This is likely to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>crowded indoor settings such as nightclubs and music venues</li>
  <li>large unstructured outdoor events such as business events and festivals</li>
  <li>very large structured events such as business events, music and spectator sport events</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/restaurants-pubs-bars-nightclubs-and-takeaway-services#hospitality-2-2" class="govuk-link">guidance around working safely from step 4, including how the NHS COVID Pass can be used to reduce the risk of transmission at venues or events in England</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You do not need a COVID-19 booster vaccination to get an NHS COVID Pass for domestic use in England. However, you can see your booster vaccination information in the ‘View COVID-19 records’ section of the NHS COVID Pass within the NHS App and online service.</p>
</div>

<h2>Residents in England who have received COVID-19 vaccinations overseas</h2>

<p>From 9 December, if you live in England and have had one or more of your COVID-19 vaccinations administered overseas, you can have your vaccination details added to your NHS Record.  You can then generate an NHS COVID Pass for domestic use and international travel if you meet certain certification requirements.</p>

<h3>Eligible vaccines</h3>

<p>You can use this service if you’ve had one or more of the following vaccines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moderna</li>
  <li>AstraZeneca</li>
  <li>Pfizer</li>
  <li>Janssen</li>
</ul>

<p>There will remain a small number of countries and territories where this service will not be enabled. However, international COVID-19 certification accepted at the UK border is also accepted at events and venues in England.</p>

<h3>Book an appointment to register your overseas vaccinations</h3>

<p>To register your overseas vaccinations, you’ll need to book an appointment at a selected list of vaccination centres across England.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/tell-NHS-about-coronavirus-vaccinations-abroad" class="govuk-link">Book an appointment to register your overseas vaccination with the NHS</a>.</p>

<p>Staff are not able to register your overseas vaccinations unless you book in advance.</p>

<p>Details of your overseas vaccination will then be recorded in the National Immunisation Management System.</p>

<p>If you’re registered with a GP in England and were vaccinated in Scotland, Wales or the Isle of Man, you do not need to book an appointment at a vaccination centre. Those registered with a GP in England who received Novavax, Valneva and Medicago vaccinations administered in the UK can also access an NHS COVID Pass.</p>

<p>If you need help using this service, contact the NHS COVID Pass service by telephoning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>119 from the UK</li>
  <li>+44 151 905 0119 from overseas (you’ll be charged according to your carrier’s rates)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting your NHS COVID Pass</h3>

<p>Eligible overseas vaccinations will display within your NHS COVID Pass in the same way as vaccines administered under the UK vaccination programme. However, you may see some fields left blank for overseas vaccines.</p>

<p>Non-eligible overseas vaccinations will not generate an NHS COVID Pass.</p>

<p>You can get your NHS COVID Pass for use at events and venues in England 14 days after completion of a full course of vaccination.</p>

<p>Your NHS COVID Pass for international travel will show the vaccinations you have received. It may take up to 5 days for vaccines to show in your NHS COVID Pass.</p>

<h2>What the barcodes and expiry dates mean</h2>

<p>On your NHS COVID Pass for domestic use, you’ll see a single barcode.</p>

<p>On your NHS COVID pass for travel, you may see more than one barcode. If you’ve received a full course of a vaccine requiring 2 doses, you will see 2 barcodes: one barcode for each vaccination dose. A full course of vaccine requiring one dose will be displayed as a single barcode.</p>

<p>If you’ve had a booster jab, this will appear as an additional barcode.</p>

<p>You will see the barcodes either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within the NHS COVID Pass in the NHS App</li>
  <li>if you save or print a PDF of your NHS COVID Pass</li>
</ul>

<p>The expiry date does not apply to your vaccination status. Any expiry date refers only to the barcode and will update automatically in the digital version of the COVID Pass. The barcodes have expiry dates to protect your data privacy.</p>

<p>However, if you download and save or print a copy of your NHS COVID Pass, the expiry date will eventually show as expired and will not automatically refresh. You will need to log into the COVID Pass service in order to generate a new copy.</p>

<h3>Storing your NHS COVID Pass in Apple Wallet</h3>

<p>If you get your NHS COVID Pass through the NHS App or Safari web browser using an Apple iPhone, you can store your COVID Pass in Apple Wallet.</p>

<p>You can store separate passes in Apple Wallet for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>entry into events and venues in England</li>
  <li>international travel</li>
</ul>

<p>You can then show either COVID Pass, even if your device is offline.</p>

<p>To add your NHS COVID Pass to the device’s wallet, tap the ‘Add to Apple Wallet’ button within the NHS COVID Pass service.</p>

<p>If you store an offline version of your NHS COVID Pass into your Apple Wallet it will only be valid until the expiry date shown on the COVID Pass. The expiry date will not refresh automatically. This means you will need to store an updated NHS COVID Pass to your Apple Wallet before you next plan to use it if your original COVID Pass has or is due to expire.</p>

<h3>Storing your NHS COVID Pass in Google Wallet (officially called Google Pay)</h3>

<p>From 6 December, if you get your NHS COVID Pass through the NHS App or by using the Google Chrome web browser on an Android phone, you’ll be able to store your NHS COVID Pass to your device.</p>

<p>You’ll see the ‘Google – save to phone’ button within the NHS App. You can then show your NHS COVID status at events and venues in England and for international travel.</p>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass will be saved on your Android phone home screen and also accessible in Google Pay. It is available to <a rel="external" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7165974" class="govuk-link">Play Protect certified mobile devices</a> running Android 5 or above.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>You can use the NHS COVID Pass and store it using the Apple Wallet or Google Pay in the Welsh language. <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://covid-status.service.nhsx.nhs.uk">Access your COVID Pass using the NHS website</a> and click the ‘Cymraeg’ button at the top of the screen to change the language from English to Welsh.</p>

<h2>What the NHS COVID Pass letter tells you: translated versions and alternative formats</h2>

<p>If you request an NHS COVID Pass letter, the letter you receive will be in English.</p>

<p>You can get information about what the letter tells you in other languages and alternative formats.</p>

<p>However, you’ll still need to show the original English letter to demonstrate your COVID status, for example when travelling abroad. You do not need your letter in a language to match the country you’re intending to travel to.</p>

<h2>If you’re unable to get vaccinated for medical reasons</h2>
<p>There are a small number of exemptions for individuals who have a medical reason which means they should not be vaccinated, and in some cases should not test either. Medical exemption status cannot be based on testing alone.</p>

<p>You can apply for proof of evidence that you have a medical reason why you should not be vaccinated and/or tested. If you are eligible for proof of medical exemption, or a carer obtains this on your behalf, you will be able to use the domestic NHS COVID Pass wherever you need to prove your COVID status.</p>

<p>Currently, businesses and event organisers in England that choose to use the NHS COVID Pass as a condition of entry can also decide whether or not to allow in people who self-declare that they are unable to be vaccinated or tested.</p>

<p>Businesses can continue to accept people who self-declare that they are medically exempt until mid-December 2021. From that point you will need to use the NHS COVID Pass to gain entry in the same way that people who are fully vaccinated do. Your NHS COVID Pass will not show that you have a medical exemption.</p>

<p>You can find out more information including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-medical-exemptions-proving-you-are-unable-to-get-vaccinated" class="govuk-link">how to apply for the NHS COVID Pass to prove that you’re unable to be vaccinated and/or get tested</a>.</p>

<h2>Protecting your data</h2>
<p>Your COVID status is held securely within the NHS App. It can only be accessed via a validated <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-log-in/">NHS login</a>. The NHS COVID Pass shows your COVID-19 vaccination status in the form of a 2D barcode and allows you to view the details of your COVID-19 vaccination record.</p>

<p>Your NHS COVID Pass letter that you request via 119 has been produced and printed with a range of embedded security features to help prevent fraud.</p>

<p>Read more in these privacy policies about how the NHS COVID Pass uses your information and about your data rights:</p>

<h2>Residents in England who have taken part in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials</h2>

<h3>Domestic use in England</h3>

<p>If you took part in a clinical trial within England you can use the NHS App or NHS.UK to get an NHS COVID Pass for domestic use in England.</p>

<p>Your NHS COVID Pass can be used to demonstrate your COVID-19 status in England. Participants should contact their clinical trial site if they cannot yet access their domestic NHS COVID Pass.</p>

<h3>International travel</h3>

<p>On 8 October the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/clinical-trialists-to-be-offered-top-up-vaccine-doses">government announced that clinical trial participants of relevant COVID-19 trials would be eligible to receive additional approved vaccine doses to facilitate travel abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Relevant trials include the Novavax, Valneva, Medicago and Com-Cov2 trials. Further information on the offer can be found by visiting the <a href="https://bepartofresearch.nihr.ac.uk/Vaccine-studies/Latest-vaccine-news/index" class="govuk-link" rel="external">National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) website</a>.</p>

<p>From 6 December, clinical trial participants who have received additional doses of approved vaccines will now see those doses in their NHS COVID Pass for travel via the NHS App and online via NHS.UK. These doses will show in your travel pass alongside your trial vaccinations, with the most recent vaccination received appearing first.</p>

<p>The doses records can take from 1 to 5 working days to appear in the NHS COVID Pass. Work is currently ongoing on a non-digital letter solution for those receiving additional doses for travel.</p>

<h3>Clinical trial participants who have not received additional doses of approved vaccines</h3>

<p>If you took part in a clinical trial within England which was ‘unblinded’ (you were informed of the vaccine used), then you should be able to obtain an NHS COVID Pass for travel if your trial site has uploaded vaccination information onto the NHS vaccine database. If your vaccine records are available and uploaded, then you will see these in your NHS COVID Pass for travel, with your most recent vaccine first.</p>

<p>Participants should contact their clinical trial site if they cannot yet access their travel pass. Before you travel abroad, check the entry rules for any country you want to go to.</p>

<p>If you took part in a clinical trial within England which was ‘blinded’ (you were not informed of the vaccine used), it is recommended that you consider other options for demonstrating your COVID-19 status when travelling abroad, such as additional testing.</p>

<p>All UK residents who have taken part or are taking part in clinical trials can follow the same rules as those fully vaccinated when returning to the UK from abroad.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Check the rules on entering England from abroad</a>.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Children under 18 do not have to demonstrate their COVID status for entry to domestic events or venues in England.</p>

<p>Children aged 16 or over can get an NHS COVID Pass for travel but should follow the entry requirements of the country they are travelling to. Further details on entry requirements can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">GOV.UK foreign travel advice pages</a> and on the websites of your destination country.</p>
