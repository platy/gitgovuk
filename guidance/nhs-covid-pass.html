<h2>NHS COVID Pass: what it is</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass lets you share your coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination records or test COVID-19 status in a secure way.</p>

<p>It allows you to show others the details of your COVID-19 vaccine (or vaccines) when travelling abroad to some countries or territories.</p>

<p>From Monday 19 July, you may be asked to demonstrate your COVID-19 status at places that use the service in England as a condition of entry to a venue or event.</p>

<h2>What you can use it for</h2>

<h3>International travel</h3>

<p>You can show the vaccination records contained within your NHS COVID Pass as proof of your COVID-19 status when travelling abroad.</p>

<p>In addition to your NHS COVID Pass, you will need to follow additional rules when travelling abroad.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-abroad-from-england-during-coronavirus-covid-19">Read an overview of all the things you need to do to travel abroad from England</a></p>

<p>You should check that the name on your passport matches how it is displayed by NHS COVID Pass at least 2 weeks before you travel. If the names are different, contact your GP practice to have your details updated.</p>

<p>The government is working with the devolved administrations to ensure everyone in the UK is able to show their COVID-19 status.</p>

<p>If you have not been fully vaccinated, you should continue to follow the entry requirements of the country you are travelling to, such as proof of a negative COVID-19 test on arrival. You should carefully research the requirements of your destination country before travelling.</p>

<p>Further details on entry requirements can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">GOV.UK foreign travel advice pages</a> and on the websites of your destination country.</p>

<h3>Domestic use in England</h3>

<p>The government has recently announced that businesses in England can use the NHS COVID Pass.</p>

<p>Some events and venues may choose to ask for the NHS COVID Pass. The government will work with organisations where people are likely to be in close proximity to others outside their household to encourage the use of this.</p>

<p>Use of the NHS COVID Pass is voluntary for individual organisations. However, we encourage the use of the NHS COVID Pass in facilities or events where people are likely to be in close proximity to a large number of people from other households for a sustained period of time.</p>

<p>This is likely to include settings that have the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>crowded indoor settings such as nightclubs and music venues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>large unstructured outdoor events such as business events and festivals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>very large structured events such as business events, music and spectator sport events</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" role="note" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>This means that you may need to show your NHS COVID Pass at places that use this service.</p>
</div>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/restaurants-pubs-bars-nightclubs-and-takeaway-services#hospitality-2-2">guidance around working safely from step 4, including how the NHS COVID Pass can be used to reduce the risk of transmission at venues or events in England</a>.</p>

<h2>Who can get an NHS COVID Pass in England</h2>

<p>If you’re aged 18 or over, you can get an NHS COVID Pass for domestic venues and events.</p>

<p>If you’re aged 16 or over, you can get an NHS COVID Pass for travel abroad but you should follow the entry requirements of the country you are travelling to.</p>

</div>

<h3>For travel abroad</h3>

<p>You can obtain your NHS COVID Pass after receiving either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 doses of the Moderna, AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine</li>
  <li>one dose of the Janssen vaccine</li>
  <li>proof of natural immunity shown by a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result for COVID-19, lasting for 180 days after the date of the positive test and following completion of the self-isolation period</li>
</ul>

<p>You must have been vaccinated in England, Wales or Scotland. If you’ve been vaccinated in Scotland, you must be both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>resident in England</li>
  <li>registered with a GP in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You can usually obtain your NHS COVID Pass within 24 hours of having your vaccination. However, it can take up to 5 days for your records to be updated.</p>

<h3>For domestic use</h3>

<p>For domestic purposes, those 18 and over can obtain an NHS COVID Pass if one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>2 weeks after completing a full course of vaccination, whether that requires 2 doses or one dose (that is, 2 doses of the Moderna, AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine, or 1 dose of the Janssen vaccine) (according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency authorised schedule).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>with evidence of a negative polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) or rapid lateral flow test taken within 48 hours of entry to a venue, with both at-home and on-site (where available) being accepted. A lateral flow test taken at home will need to be reported into the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">public reporting system</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proof of natural immunity shown by a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result for COVID-19, lasting for 180 days from the date of the positive test and following completion of the self-isolation period</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must have been vaccinated in England, Wales or Scotland. If you’ve been vaccinated in Scotland, you must be both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>resident in England</li>
  <li>registered with a GP in England</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exemptions for domestic use</h4>

<p>If you have received a trial vaccine as part of a formally approved COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK, you will be able to prove your status through the NHS COVID Pass or with a letter confirming your participation in the trial from your trial site.</p>

<p>See <a href="#vaccine-clinical-trials" class="govuk-link">Residents in England who have taken part in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials</a> below.</p>

<h3>If you’ve had a COVID-19 booster vaccination</h3>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass for travel does not currently include COVID-19 booster vaccinations. The government is reviewing the implications and requirements of boosters for international travel certification. It is looking at whether and how booster vaccinations could be included in the NHS COVID Pass for travel.</p>

<p>You do not need a COVID-19 booster vaccination to get an NHS COVID Pass for domestic use in England.</p>

<h2>If you’re unable to get vaccinated for medical reasons</h2>

<p>There are a small number of exemptions for individuals who have a medical reason which means they should not be vaccinated, and in some cases should not test either. Medical exemption status cannot be based on testing alone.</p>

<p>You can apply for proof of evidence that you have a medical reason why you should not be vaccinated and/or tested.  If you are eligible for proof of medical exemption, or a carer obtains this on your behalf, you will be able to use the domestic NHS COVID Pass wherever you need to prove your COVID-19 status.</p>

<p>Currently, businesses and event organisers in England that choose to use the NHS COVID Pass as a condition of entry can decide whether or not to allow in people who self-declare that they are unable to be vaccinated or tested.</p>

<p>Businesses can continue to accept people who self-declare that they are medically exempt until mid December 2021, from which point,  have to use the NHS COVID Pass to gain entry in the same way that people who are fully vaccinated do. Your NHS COVID Pass will not show that you have a medical exemption.</p>

<p>You can find out more information including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-medical-exemptions-proving-you-are-unable-to-get-vaccinated">how to apply for the NHS COVID Pass to prove that you’re unable to be vaccinated and/or get tested</a>.</p>

<h2>How to access the NHS COVID Pass</h2>

<h3>Access the NHS COVID Pass through the NHS App</h3>

<p>You can access your NHS COVID Pass through the free <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-app/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS App</a> on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet. Proof of your COVID-19 status will be shown within the NHS App.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You need to be registered with a GP in England to use the NHS App. If you’re not registered with a GP, you can still access the NHS COVID Pass via the NHS website (NHS.UK) or via 119 (select the ‘NHS COVID Pass service’) to request a letter.</p>
</div>

<p>We recommend that you register with the app before booking international travel. For access via the NHS App you do not need to contact your GP.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The NHS App is not the same as the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>
</div>

<p>In the NHS App, your COVID-19 status includes a 2D barcode. The expiry date does not apply to your vaccination status. Any expiry date refers only to the barcode and will update automatically each time you go into the NHS App.</p>

<p>If you obtain your NHS COVID Pass through the NHS App or Safari web browser using an Apple iPhone, then you will be able to store your COVID Pass into Apple Wallet. You can already show your COVID-19 status at events and venues in England directly from your Apple Wallet even if your device is offline.</p>

<p>From 23 September, you will also be able to store your COVID Pass for international travel into Apple Wallet, even if your device is offline. You will see the ‘Add to Apple Wallet’ button on your screen within the NHS App. If you store both your international and domestic NHS COVID Passes, you will see 2 separate cards stored in your Apple Wallet.</p>

<p>If you store an offline version of your NHS COVID Pass into your Apple Wallet it will only be valid until the expiry date shown on your COVID Pass. The expiry date will not refresh automatically. This means you will need to store an updated NHS COVID Pass to your Apple Wallet before you next plan to use it if your original COVID Pass is due to expire.</p>

<h3>Access the NHS COVID Pass through the NHS website</h3>

<p>You can view your COVID-19 status online and download or print it as a PDF document. To access the service, you’ll need to register for an <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-log-in/" class="govuk-link">NHS login</a> if you do not have one already. NHS login registrations may take longer than usual when there are high numbers of requests.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-pass/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Access the NHS COVID Pass via the NHS website</a></p>

<p>Your COVID-19 status includes a 2D barcode. The expiry date does not apply to your vaccination status. Any expiry date refers only to the barcode and will update automatically. If you download and print a copy, the expiry date will eventually show as expired and will not automatically refresh.</p>

<h4>Using the NHS COVID Pass for international travel</h4>

<p>If you’ve received a full course of a vaccine requiring 2 doses, you will see 2 barcodes within the NHS App: one barcode per vaccine.</p>

<p>If you print a PDF of your COVID Pass status, your printed copy will show 2 barcodes. The printed copy is valid until its expiry date.</p>

<p>A full course of vaccine requiring one dose will be displayed as a single barcode.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your NHS COVID Pass can now be scanned to check and validate your COVID-19 vaccination status in venues in over 40 countries, including those in the EU.</p>

<p>If you downloaded your NHS COVID Pass as a PDF or added it to your Apple Wallet before 1 November 2021, you’ll need to download, reprint or add an updated version before you travel so that your NHS COVID Pass is valid.</p>

<h3>Request an NHS COVID Pass letter to be posted to you</h3>

<p>Request a letter only if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have been fully vaccinated by the NHS in England</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are planning to travel in the next 4 weeks to a country that requires evidence of COVID-19 vaccination</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can obtain an NHS COVID Pass at age 16 plus but do not need one to access venues or events in England if you are under 18 years of age.</p>

<p>You can request an NHS COVID Pass letter:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/covid-status-letter/">via the NHS website</a></li>
  <li>by calling 119 (select the ‘NHS COVID Pass service’) if you do not have access to a smartphone, computer or tablet</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re overseas, call +44 151 905 0119 to access the NHS COVID Pass service. You’ll be charged according to your carrier’s rates.</p>

<p>We expect the letter to take up to 5 working days to reach you.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The letter will be sent to the address registered with your GP. If you have recently moved house, make sure you’ve given your new address to your GP practice before requesting a letter.</p>
</div>

<p>The COVID-19 post-vaccination letter was rebranded from 5 July. It now displays the title ‘NHS COVID Pass’ and the logos of all 4 nations instead of just the NHS logo.</p>

<p>If you got a COVID-19 post-vaccination letter before 5 July, this is still valid. You do not need to apply for a new version.</p>

<p>If you intend to use the letter when travelling abroad, other countries will treat the old version of the letter in the same way as they treat the new one.</p>

<p>You should confirm the entry requirements of your intended destination country using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">GOV.UK foreign travel advice pages</a>, as requirements for testing and vaccination can vary from country to country.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" aria-label="Warning" role="note">
<p>GPs cannot provide letters showing your COVID-19 status.</p>
</div>

<h2>What the NHS COVID Pass letter tells you: translated versions and alternative formats</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass letter you receive will be in English.</p>

<p>You can get information about what the letter tells you in other languages and alternative formats.</p>

<p>However, you’ll still need to show the original English letter to demonstrate your COVID status, for example when travelling abroad. You do not need your letter in a language to match the country you’re intending to travel to.</p>

<h2>Protecting your data</h2>

<p>Your COVID-19 status is held securely within the NHS App. It can only be accessed via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-log-in/" rel="external">NHS login service</a>.</p>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass only shows your COVID-19 vaccination status in the form of a 2D barcode, which allows you to view your vaccination record.</p>

<p>The digital version of the NHS COVID Pass service can be accessed via the NHS App or NHS.UK.</p>

<p>When you access your NHS COVID Pass via the NHS App, or directly via the NHS website, you will need to use your NHS login. NHS login has advanced security features to protect you and minimise any risk of fraud. Your vaccination status displays your vaccination record only and no other personal health records or data.</p>

<p>All the information displayed is derived from the National Immunisation Management System (<abbr title="National Immunisation Management System">NIMS</abbr>) database operated by NHS England. The NHS COVID Pass service does not capture any new information. All it does is enable secure access to your immunisation records within <abbr title="National Immunisation Management System">NIMS</abbr> and use a small subset of that information (NHS number, name and COVID-19 vaccination history) to enable the creation of a 2D barcode that can later be shown when travelling abroad. The service has been developed in strict compliance with GDPR and privacy regulations.</p>

<p>Your NHS COVID Pass letter that you request via 119 has been produced and printed with a range of embedded security features to help prevent fraud. It includes a barcode which provides a unique reference that can be used to verify your individual COVID vaccination record.</p>

<h2>Residents in England who have taken part in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials</h2>

<p>Residents in England that have taken part, or are taking part, in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials will have received a letter from their clinical trial site.</p>

<p>The letter ensures that anyone vaccinated as part of a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial can prove they were in a clinical trial and therefore should be recognised as fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>If you did not receive this letter, contact your clinical trial site.</p>

<p>This commitment was made by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer in an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-from-the-deputy-chief-medical-officer-to-uk-vaccine-study-volunteers/open-letter-from-deputy-chief-medical-officer-to-uk-residents-who-have-volunteered-to-take-part-in-covid-19-vaccine-studies">open letter on 11 June 2021</a>.</p>

<p>We are working with the devolved administrations to ensure a consistent UK approach. We are also working to ensure that all those who participated in COVID-19 vaccine trials can access their vaccine records via the NHS App or NHS.UK</p>

<h3>Domestic use in England</h3>

<p>If you took part in a clinical trial within England you should also be able to use the NHS App or NHS.UK to obtain an NHS COVID Pass for domestic use in England.</p>

<p>The letter and NHS COVID Pass can be used when demonstrating your COVID-19 status in England.</p>

<h3>International travel</h3>

<p>If you took part in a clinical trial within England which was ‘unblinded’ (that is, you were informed of the vaccine used), then you should be able to use the NHS App or NHS.UK to obtain an NHS COVID Pass for international travel from England. Before you travel abroad, check the entry rules for the country you want to go to.</p>

<p>If you took part in a clinical trial within England which was ‘blinded’ (that is, you were not informed of the vaccine used), it is recommended that you consider other options for demonstrating your COVID-19 status when travelling abroad, such as additional testing.</p>

<p>All UK residents who have taken part or are taking part in clinical trials will not need to quarantine when returning to the UK from abroad, unless they’ve been in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">a country on the red list</a> in the 10 days before they arrive.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">Check the rules on entering England from abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>Novavax vaccine</h3>

<p>If you took part in clinical trials and received a full dose of the Novavax vaccine, you can now use the NHS COVID Pass to demonstrate your COVID-19 status. If you experience issues with obtaining your NHS COVID Pass, contact your clinical trial site.</p>

<p>Before travelling abroad, we recommend that you check the entry requirements of your intended destination country, including which vaccines are recognised by them.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>Children under 18 do not have to demonstrate their COVID-19 status for entry to domestic events or venues in England.</p>

<p>Children aged 16 or over can get an NHS COVID Pass for travel but should follow the entry requirements of the country they are travelling to. Further details on entry requirements can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">GOV.UK foreign travel advice pages</a> and on the websites of your destination country.</p>
