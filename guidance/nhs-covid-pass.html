<h2>Changes to the NHS COVID Pass from 12 May</h2>

<p>From 12 May 2022 the domestic NHS COVID Pass will no longer be available.</p>

<p>This means that venues and events will no longer be able to request it as a condition of entry.</p>

<p>In line with this change, from 12 May the medical exemptions service will no longer accept new applications from people who want to use the domestic NHS COVID Pass to prove they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. GPs will have until 11 July to process any applications received by 12 May.</p>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass for international travel will continue to be available as normal.</p>
</div>

<h2>NHS COVID Pass: what it is and how to get it</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass lets you share your coronavirus (COVID-19) status records in a secure way.</p>

<p>It allows you to show others the details of your COVID-19 status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>when travelling abroad to some countries or territories</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at venues or events across the UK that choose to use the NHS COVID Pass as a condition of entry (until 12 May – see box above)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can get an NHS COVID Pass:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>digitally through the NHS App or online via NHS.UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a letter sent to you in the post if travelling abroad</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out the eligibility requirements on the NHS website.</p>

<h2>How to use the NHS COVID Pass when travelling abroad</h2>

<p>You can show the vaccination records in your NHS COVID Pass as proof of your COVID-19 status when travelling abroad.</p>

<p>Proof of recovery from prior COVID-19 infection if you have tested positive on an NHS <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test in the last 180 days is also shown.</p>

<p>You will also need to follow additional rules set by the country you are travelling to when abroad.</p>

<p>You should register with the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/" rel="external">NHS App</a>&nbsp;before booking international travel.</p>

<p>Read more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-abroad-from-england-during-coronavirus-covid-19">travelling abroad during COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>You should check that your first name and your surname on your passport match how they are displayed by your NHS COVID Pass at least 3 weeks before you travel. If the names are different, contact your GP practice to have your details updated. Please note, name changes could result in temporary issues with matching your GP record to your hospital and prescription records.</p>

<p>If you have not been fully vaccinated, you should continue to follow the entry requirements of the country you are travelling to, such as proof of a negative COVID-19 test on arrival. You should carefully research the requirements of your destination country before travelling.</p>

<p>Further details on entry requirements can be found on the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">GOV.UK foreign travel advice pages</a>&nbsp;and on the websites of your destination country.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 booster vaccinations</h3>

<p>You should&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-booster-vaccine/" rel="external">get your COVID-19 booster</a>&nbsp;as soon as you are eligible, but you do not need a COVID-19 booster vaccination to get an NHS COVID Pass for domestic use.</p>

<p>If you’ve received a booster vaccination it will show in your NHS COVID Pass for travel within 5 days. You’ll see a 2D barcode for each vaccination record.</p>

<p>Your vaccinations will show in reverse order, with the most recent first. This is also the case if you download a PDF of your NHS COVID Pass for travel, or store it within the Apple Wallet or Google Pay Wallet.</p>

<p>If you’re about to travel, you should download an updated PDF version of your NHS COVID Pass, or store an updated version in your Apple Wallet or Google Pay Wallet.</p>

<p>You’ll also see your detailed booster vaccination information in the ‘View COVID-19 Records’ section of the NHS COVID Pass within the NHS App and online service.</p>

<p>If you require non-digital proof of your booster vaccination for international travel, you can order an NHS COVID Pass letter via the NHS 119 service or via NHS.UK. Your letter will show a 2D barcode for each vaccination you’ve received, including your booster vaccination.</p>

<p>Some countries require travellers to demonstrate that they received their primary course of a COVID-19 approved vaccination or booster within a certain time period. Travellers should carefully check requirements before travelling.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your NHS COVID Pass can be scanned to check and validate your COVID-19 status in venues in over 60 countries and territories, including those in the EU.</p>

<h2>How to use the NHS COVID Pass if requested by venues and events</h2>

<h3>If you’re a visitor</h3>

<p>Some venues across the UK may choose to check the COVID-19 status of visitors or their workforce. You may be asked to demonstrate your COVID-19 status as a condition of entry.</p>

<p>You can demonstrate your COVID-19 status using the domestic NHS COVID Pass if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you’ve been vaccinated with 2 doses of an approved vaccine (or one of the single-dose Janssen vaccine)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you’ve completed a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test or negative rapid lateral flow test within the past 48 hours – events and venues may choose to accept privately provided test results</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you’re exempt from vaccination on the basis of a medical exemption or you’ve taken part in a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you live in Wales or the Isle of Man, you can access the domestic NHS COVID Pass and use this to demonstrate your COVID status.</p>

<p>Events and venues across the UK may also choose to accept forms of proof other than the NHS COVID Pass, such as privately provided test results. You should check the conditions of entry of the event or venue you are attending.</p>

<h4>International visitors</h4>

<p>If you were vaccinated in another country, you may show alternative proof of vaccination.</p>

<p>Guidance for organisations can be found at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2>Residents in England who have received COVID-19 vaccinations overseas</h2>

<p>If you live in England and have had one or more of your COVID-19 vaccinations administered overseas, you can have your vaccination details added to your NHS Record. You can then generate an NHS COVID Pass for domestic use and international travel if you meet certain certification requirements.</p>

<p>You can use this service if you or your child are aged 5 years old or over and have an NHS number.</p>

<h3>Eligible vaccines</h3>

<p>You can use this service if you or your child have had one or more of the following vaccines outside of England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oxford/AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria)</li>
  <li>Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty)</li>
  <li>Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen)</li>
  <li>Moderna (Spikevax)</li>
  <li>Institute of India (Covishield)</li>
  <li>Bharat Biotech (Covaxin)</li>
  <li>SinoVac (CoronaVac)</li>
  <li>Beijing Institute of Biological Products (Sinopharm <abbr title="Beijing Institute of Biological Products">BIBP</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you received a Sinopharm vaccine, your evidence must show that it was manufactured by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products (<abbr title="Beijing Institute of Biological Products">BIBP</abbr>). Other Sinopharm manufacturers are not accepted for this service.</p>

<h3>Book an appointment to register your overseas vaccinations</h3>

<p>To register your overseas vaccinations, you’ll need to book an appointment at a selected list of vaccination centres across England.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/tell-NHS-about-coronavirus-vaccinations-abroad" rel="external">Book an appointment to register your overseas vaccination with the NHS</a></p>

<p>Staff are not able to register your overseas vaccinations unless you book in advance.</p>

<p>Details of your overseas vaccination will then be recorded in the National Immunisation Management System.</p>

<p>If you’re registered with a GP in England and were vaccinated in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or the Isle of Man, you do not need to book an appointment at a vaccination centre.</p>

<h3>Booking for someone else</h3>

<p>You can only book for someone else, such as your child or someone you care for, if you have their consent. You’ll need to enter their details when booking.</p>

<p>If you book for someone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>aged 18 years old or over – they must attend the appointment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>under 18 years old – they do not have to attend the appointment if you go instead of them</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Children under 16 years old cannot attend an appointment on their own. They must be accompanied by a parent, guardian or responsible person aged 18 years old or over.</p>

<h3>Getting your NHS COVID Pass</h3>

<p>Eligible overseas vaccinations will display within your NHS COVID Pass in the same way as vaccines administered under the UK vaccination programme. However, you may see some fields left blank for overseas vaccines.</p>

<p>Non-eligible overseas vaccinations will not generate an NHS COVID Pass.</p>

<p>Your NHS COVID Pass for international travel will show the vaccinations you have received. It may take up to 5 days for vaccines to show in your NHS COVID Pass.</p>

<h2>Residents in England who have taken part in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials</h2>

<h3>Domestic use</h3>

<p>If you took part in a clinical trial within England you can use the NHS App or&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS.UK</a>&nbsp;to get an NHS COVID Pass for domestic use.</p>

<p>Your NHS COVID Pass can be used to demonstrate your COVID-19 status at venues and events across the UK that have chosen to carry out COVID-19 status checks. Participants should contact their clinical trial site if they cannot yet access their domestic NHS COVID Pass.</p>

<h3>International travel</h3>

<p>On 8 October 2021 the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/clinical-trialists-to-be-offered-top-up-vaccine-doses">government announced that clinical trial participants of relevant COVID-19 trials would be eligible to receive additional approved vaccine doses to facilitate travel abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Further information on the offer can be found by visiting the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://bepartofresearch.nihr.ac.uk/Vaccine-studies/Latest-vaccine-news/index" rel="external">National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) website</a>.</p>

<p>Clinical trial participants who have received additional doses of approved vaccines will see those doses in their NHS COVID Pass for travel via the NHS App and online via&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS.UK</a>. These doses will show in your travel pass alongside your trial vaccinations, with the most recent vaccination received appearing first.</p>

<p>If you need a non-digital NHS COVID Pass for travel, the NHS COVID Pass letter also includes additional ‘top up’ approved vaccinations. You can ask for this via the NHS 119 service or via&nbsp;NHS.UK. The letter should take up to 7 days to arrive after you order it.</p>

<h3>Clinical trial participants who have not received additional doses of approved vaccines</h3>

<p>If you took part in a clinical trial within England which was ‘unblinded’ (you were informed of the vaccine used), then you should be able to obtain an NHS COVID Pass for travel if your trial site has uploaded vaccination information onto the NHS vaccine database. If your vaccine records are available and uploaded, then you will see these in your NHS COVID Pass for travel, with your most recent vaccine first.</p>

<p>Participants should contact their clinical trial site if they cannot yet access their travel pass. Before you travel abroad, check the entry rules for any country you want to go to.</p>

<p>If you took part in a clinical trial within England which was ‘blinded’ (you were not informed of the vaccine used), it is recommended that you consider other options for demonstrating your COVID-19 status when travelling abroad, such as additional testing.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<h3>NHS COVID Pass for domestic use across the UK</h3>

<p>The domestic NHS COVID Pass is available to those aged 18 and above.</p>

<h3>NHS COVID Pass digital service for international travel</h3>

<p>Children aged 12 and over are able to get a digital NHS COVID Pass for international travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A digital NHS COVID Pass will:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide a record of COVID-19 vaccinations received</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>show evidence of prior infection for 180 days following a positive NHS <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See ‘How to use the NHS COVID Pass when travelling abroad’ above.</p>

<p>A digital NHS COVID Pass is available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>via the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/get-digital-covid-pass/" rel="external">NHS.UK website</a>&nbsp;for those aged 12 and over (as a PDF you can download or print)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>via the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/about-the-nhs-app/" rel="external">NHS App</a>&nbsp;for those aged 13 and over (age restrictions apply for use of the App)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To request an NHS COVID Pass, the child will first need to register for an&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-login/" rel="external">NHS login</a>. They can do this themselves (or a parent or guardian can help register on their behalf). They’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>register using the child’s details (including the child’s email address)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>verify the child’s identity using the child’s passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Verifying identity can take a few days to complete (although it normally takes around 24 hours).</p>

<h3>NHS COVID Pass letter for international travel</h3>

<p>Some children who’ve had a full primary course of COVID-19 vaccination can get an NHS COVID Pass letter for international travel, with an internationally recognised 2D barcode. This service is available to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>children living in England aged 5 to 15</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children living in Wales and Isle of Man aged 5 to 11</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Letters sent to children living in Wales will be in English and Welsh.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Children aged 12 and over living in Wales and Isle of Man cannot get an NHS COVID Pass letter for travel abroad using this service – they should request letters from those nations’ certification services.</p>
</div>

<p>This service is not available to those who have received an incomplete course of vaccination (for example, one dose of a 2-dose vaccine).</p>

<p>You cannot use the NHS COVID Pass letter for travel abroad to prove recovery from COVID-19 infection.</p>

<h4>Requesting an NHS COVID Pass letter</h4>

<p>Only a person with legal responsibility for the child (such as a parent or guardian) can request the letter on their behalf. You can request the letter for yourself if you’re aged 12 or over.</p>

<p>You can request an NHS COVID Pass letter for travel abroad:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>online at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-pass/get-your-covid-pass-letter/" rel="external">Get your NHS COVID Pass letter</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by calling the 119 service (0808 1624 119 for residents of the Isle of Man)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/get-your-nhs-covid-pass" rel="external">Welsh Government website</a>, for children living in Wales</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should wait 5 days after the full primary course of vaccination has been completed before requesting a letter. It can then take up to 7 working days for the letter to arrive.</p>

<p>The letter is sent to the address held on the child’s NHS record (the address held by their GP). It will show all the vaccinations they’ve received. Letters for children aged 5 to 11 will not include details of the administration centre where the vaccination took place, but are still fully valid.</p>

<p>Your GP cannot provide you with this letter.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You should carefully check the entry requirements of the country you are travelling to. Further details on entry requirements can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">GOV.UK foreign travel advice pages</a> and on the websites of your destination country.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you’re unable to get vaccinated for medical reasons</h2>

<p>Some individuals are unable to be vaccinated and, in some cases, tested, for medical reasons. You can apply for proof that you have a medical reason why you should not be vaccinated or why you should not be vaccinated or tested.</p>

<p>All exemptions will be assessed by your doctor, specialist clinician or midwife. The outcome will be sent directly back to you. If approved, your domestic NHS COVID Pass can then be used to prove your status at venues or events across the UK that have chosen to carry out COVID-19 status checks, or healthcare settings that may require COVID status checks. Your medical exemption will be included in the ‘View COVID-19 Records’ section with an expiry date (if applicable).</p>

<p>Your medical exemption will not appear in the travel NHS COVID Pass. It is up to other countries to decide whether or not residents in England with a medical exemption can follow the same rules for travel as those who are fully vaccinated.</p>

<h3>Reasons you could get a medical exemption</h3>

<p>The possible reasons for exemptions are limited. Examples that might be reasons for a medical exemption are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>people receiving end of life care where vaccination is not in the person’s best interests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people with learning disabilities, autism or a combination of impairments which mean that vaccination and testing result in distress and who cannot be vaccinated through reasonable adjustments such as an accessible environment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person with severe allergies to all currently available vaccines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those who have had an adverse reaction to the first dose (for example, myocarditis)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Anticoagulation and clotting disorders would only be viewed as need for exemption in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>You can also get a temporary exemption which will allow you to use the NHS COVID Pass if you have a short-term medical condition or are pregnant and choose to take this option.</p>

<h3>If you’re pregnant</h3>

<p>Events and venues across the UK that have chosen to require COVID status as a condition of entry may accept a MAT B1 certificate or medical exemption letter. You should check the conditions of entry of the event or venue you are attending.</p>

<h3>How to apply for and receive your NHS COVID Pass when you’re unable to be vaccinated</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Phone the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;COVID Pass service on 119 to ask for an&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;COVID Pass medical exemptions application form.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also call to find out more information about&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;COVID Pass medical exemptions.</p>

<p>The call handler at the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;COVID Pass service will ask you some questions. You will need to give:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your date of birth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;number (if you know it)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the name of your&nbsp;GP&nbsp;and/or specialist clinician</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. If you’re eligible to apply, you’ll get an application form by post.</p>

<p>You should not ask your&nbsp;GP&nbsp;for an application form. If you do go to your&nbsp;GP&nbsp;before you get your application form, you’ll be asked to call the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;COVID Pass service on 119.</p>

<p>3. Return your application form to the&nbsp;GP&nbsp;or relevant clinician stated on the form.</p>

<p>Your application will be clinically reviewed by your doctor, specialist or midwife within 10 days. Your&nbsp;GP, specialist or midwife may ask to speak with you if needed, but you won’t need to book this when you submit your application.</p>

<p>You or your carer can complete this form.</p>

<p>4. You’ll automatically get the results of your application by post once your application has been processed.</p>

<p>You don’t need to contact your&nbsp;GP&nbsp;or the clinician reviewing your exemption unless they ask you to contact them.</p>

<p>5. If you get a medical exemption you can use the domestic&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;COVID Pass wherever you need to. There will be an option to show this in the domestic ‘View COVID-19 Records’.</p>

<p>The pass will not show others that you have a medical exemption, just that you have the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;COVID Pass.</p>

<p>You can&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/get-digital-covid-pass/" rel="external">access your&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;COVID Pass digitally – on the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;app or the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also download it as a pdf and print it or save it to Google Pay or an Apple Wallet on a smartphone or laptop.</p>

<p>Find out&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-pass/" rel="external">more about the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;COVID Pass on the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;website</a>.</p>

<p>6. The clinical decision on your medical exemption is final. You cannot appeal the decision. However, if you have been unsatisfied with the process of applying for an exemption, you can call the 119 service to report your feedback. Also, if you are unhappy with the clinical assessment of your exemption, you can discuss this further with your GP.</p>

<h2>Protecting your data</h2>

<p>Your COVID-19 status is held securely within the NHS App. It can only be accessed via a validated&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-log-in/" rel="external">NHS login</a>. The NHS COVID Pass shows your COVID-19 vaccination status in the form of a 2D barcode and allows you to view the details of your COVID-19 vaccination record.</p>

<p>Your NHS COVID Pass letter that you request via 119 has been produced and printed with a range of embedded security features to help prevent fraud.</p>

<p>Read more in these privacy policies about how the NHS COVID Pass uses your information and about your data rights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/nhs-app/nhs-app-legal-and-cookies/nhs-app-privacy-policy/" rel="external">NHS App privacy policy</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What the barcodes and expiry dates mean</h2>

<p>On the digital version of your NHS COVID Pass for domestic use, you’ll see a single barcode.</p>

<p>On your NHS COVID Pass for international travel you will see one 2D barcode for each vaccination dose.</p>

<p>You will see the barcodes either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>within the NHS COVID Pass in the NHS App</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you save or print a PDF of your NHS COVID Pass</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on the travel NHS COVID Pass letter</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The expiry date does not apply to your vaccination status. Any expiry date refers only to the barcode and will update automatically in the digital version of the COVID Pass. The barcodes have expiry dates to protect your data privacy.</p>

<p>However, if you download and save or print a copy of your NHS COVID Pass, the expiry date will eventually show as expired and will not automatically refresh. You will need to log into the NHS COVID Pass service to generate a new copy.</p>

<p>If you order a travel NHS COVID Pass letter via the NHS 119 service or online via NHS.UK, the barcodes in your letter will expire after 30 days. The domestic NHS COVID Pass letter also has a 30 day expiry.</p>

<h2>Storing your NHS COVID Pass in Apple Wallet</h2>

<p>If you get your NHS COVID Pass through the NHS App or Safari web browser using an Apple iPhone, you can store your NHS COVID Pass in Apple Wallet.</p>

<p>You can store separate passes in Apple Wallet for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>entry into events and venues across the UK that have chosen to carry out COVID-19 status checks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>international travel</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can then show either the domestic or international NHS COVID Pass, even if your device is offline.</p>

<p>To add your NHS COVID Pass to the device’s wallet, tap the ‘Add to Apple Wallet’ button within the NHS COVID Pass service.</p>

<p>If you store an offline version of your NHS COVID Pass into your Apple Wallet it will only be valid until the expiry date shown on the NHS COVID Pass. The expiry date will not refresh automatically. This means you will need to store an updated NHS COVID Pass to your Apple Wallet before you next plan to use it if your original NHS COVID Pass has expired or is due to expire.</p>

<h2>Storing your NHS COVID Pass in Google Wallet (officially called Google Pay)</h2>

<p>If you get your NHS COVID Pass through the NHS App or by using the Google Chrome web browser on an Android phone, you’ll be able to store your NHS COVID Pass to your device.</p>

<p>You’ll see the ‘Google – save to phone’ button within the NHS App. You can then show your NHS COVID-19 status at events and venues that have chosen to carry out COVID-19 status checks and for international travel.</p>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass will be saved on your Android phone home screen and also accessible in Google Pay. It is available to&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7165974" rel="external">Play Protect certified mobile devices</a>&nbsp;running Android 5 or above.</p>

<p>You can use the NHS COVID Pass and store it using the Apple Wallet or Google Pay in the Welsh language.&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://covid-status.service.nhsx.nhs.uk/" rel="external">Access your COVID Pass using the NHS website</a>&nbsp;and click the ‘Cymraeg’ button at the top of the screen to change the language from English to Welsh.</p>

<h2>What the NHS COVID Pass letter tells you: translated versions and alternative formats</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass letter for international travel can be used to show others that you’ve had a full course of the COVID-19 vaccine (including a booster vaccination if you’ve had one) when travelling to some countries or territories.</p>

<p>If you request an NHS COVID Pass letter, the letter you receive will be in English.</p>

<p>You can request a leaflet about the content of the letter and what it tells you in other languages and alternative formats.</p>

<p>You will still need to show the original English letter (not the supporting leaflet) to demonstrate your COVID-19 status when travelling abroad.</p>

<p>The letters are valid for 30 days from the date you order them. You should get them within 7 working days from the date of request.</p>

<p>If you do not have access to a smartphone, computer or tablet, you can call 119 from within the UK. Select the ‘NHS COVID Pass service’ and ask for an NHS COVID Pass letter to be posted to you.</p>

<h2>Guidance for organisations carrying out COVID-19 status checks</h2>

<p>If you’re an organisation that has chosen to carry out COVID-19 status checks on your visitors or staff, you should consider how they fit with your legal obligations, such as health and safety and equalities legislation.</p>

<p>The domestic NHS COVID Pass can be used to check that attendees are fully vaccinated, have recently recorded a negative test result or are exempt. The domestic NHS COVID Pass shows the person’s COVID status only. It does not show information about why someone has that status.</p>

<p>If you’re checking passes using the NHS COVID Pass Verifier app, you will be processing personal data and therefore you will have obligations as a data controller under data protection legislation.</p>

<p>You’ll find full details on&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/covid-19-response/nhs-covid-pass-verifier-app/" rel="external">how to use the NHS COVID Pass Verifier app</a>&nbsp;on the NHSX website.</p>

<h3>Data protection – guidance for organisations</h3>

<p>If you are responsible for a venue or event that has chosen to use COVID-19 status checks as a condition of entry, data protection legislation will apply when you are processing personal data.</p>

<p>You can find further information about looking after your customers’ personal data when completing COVID-19 status checks on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/global/data-protection-and-coronavirus-19/" rel="external">Data protection and coronavirus-19</a> on the Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>) website. This page also has information about when the UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> applies and on customer and employee consent.</p>

<p>You must also comply with the law when processing any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/" rel="external">special category health data</a>.</p>

<p>When you use the Verifier app for the first time, you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions. Read the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/covid-19-response/nhs-covid-pass-verifier-app/domestic-covid-pass-verifier-app-user-guide/" rel="external">Verifier app user guide</a>&nbsp;on the NHS website for more details.</p>

<h3>Data controller obligations and transparency</h3>

<p>If you use the NHS COVID Pass Verifier app to scan an attendee’s NHS COVID Pass, you will be processing personal data and therefore you will have obligations as a data controller under data protection legislation. A limited visual check of an NHS COVID Pass is not subject to&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted" rel="external">data protection regulations</a>.</p>

<p>If your venue or event uses the NHS COVID Pass, you should communicate clearly with your customers, so they know what to expect when visiting your venue. This also includes how their data will be handled. Further information about privacy information can be found in the&nbsp;<abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>’s&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/" rel="external">Right to be informed</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
