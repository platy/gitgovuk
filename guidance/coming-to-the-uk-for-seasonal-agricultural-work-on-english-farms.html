<p>This is national guidance for England.</p>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/booking-and-staying-in-a-quarantine-hotel-when-you-arrive-in-england">book and stay in managed quarantine</a> if you have been in, or through any of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19" class="govuk-link">red list countries from where travel to the UK is banned</a> during the 10 days before you enter the UK.</p>

<p>You and your employer must follow this guidance if you are coming to England to work on a farm as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a seasonal agricultural worker under the Seasonal Workers Pilot</li>
  <li>an EU worker with settled or pre-settled status, coming to pick fruit or vegetables</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you travel to the UK you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england" class="govuk-link">take a test</a> 48 to 72 hours before your departure date that certifies a negative result for COVID-19.</p>

<p>You will not be allowed to enter the UK if you receive a positive test result.</p>

<p>Before you travel, you must fill in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">Passenger Locator Form</a> with your journey, contact details and the address at the farm where you will work and live.</p>

<p>On the form you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add the farm address as your home address</li>
  <li>select ‘No’ when asked if you need to self-isolate</li>
  <li>select your occupation as ‘seasonal agricultural worker’ from the menu</li>
</ul>

<p>You must provide these details up to 48 hours before you arrive in England.</p>

<p>You will need to prove at UK border controls that you are a seasonal agricultural worker.</p>

<p>Read guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules#seasonal-agricultural-workers" class="govuk-link">what you will need to show when you arrive at the UK border</a>.</p>

<p>You should pack and carry with you enough essential supplies (including clothing, medicine and cigarettes) to cover the time from the start of your travel and the 10-day isolation period.</p>

<p>If you develop coronavirus symptoms when you are travelling to England, you must tell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one of the crew on your plane, boat or train</li>
  <li>the driver if you are travelling by bus or coach</li>
</ul>

<p>They will let staff in the airport, port or station know, so they can tell you what you must do when you arrive.</p>

<h2>Travelling to the farm</h2>

<p>You must not travel if you have <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">coronavirus symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>When you arrive in England, you must go straight to the farm where you will be living and working. Someone you will be staying with at the farm should collect you from the airport, port or station.</p>

<p>If you need to use public transport to get to the farm, you must wear a face covering on all public transport and in transport hubs, unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age, health or another condition.</p>

<p>Wash your hands before you travel and when you arrive at the farm. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">guidance on making and wearing a face covering</a>.</p>

<p>Stay 2 metres apart from other people where possible, or one metre with risk mitigation where 2 metres is not possible.</p>

<h2>At the farm accommodation</h2>

<p>You must stay at the farm address you provided when you arrived at the border.</p>

<p>If you do not live on the farm you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>will not be able to work for the first 10 days</li>
  <li>will have to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk" class="govuk-link">self-isolate on arrival in England</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your first 10 days in England</h2>

<p>During your first 10 days in England, you can work on the farm if you are living on the farm. Your employer should place you into a ‘household’ or cohort group that you will live and work with most of the time.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid contact with others on the farm outside of your cohort group</li>
  <li>follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing">social distancing rules</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From 6 April, you must take a <a href="#rapid" class="govuk-link">rapid lateral ﬂow test</a> on day 2, day 5 and day 8 after you arrive.</p>

<p>Read guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england">how to quarantine when you arrive in England</a>.</p>

<p>You must not leave the farm during the first 10 days unless there’s an emergency or you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>urgent medical assistance (or where your doctor has advised you to get medical assistance)</li>
  <li>to access critical public services such as social services and victim support services</li>
  <li>to go to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic#who-should-attend" class="govuk-link">funeral</a> of a close relative</li>
  <li>to fulfil a legal obligation such as take part in legal proceedings</li>
</ul>

<p>If it is not possible to test on the farm, you may leave the farm to collect or take a test.</p>

<p>You should ask your employer or colleagues for help, or order a delivery if you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>buy groceries or other shopping</li>
  <li>collect medication</li>
</ul>

<p>You must follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/construction-and-other-outdoor-work">guidance on safer working</a> when carrying out work on the farm.</p>

<p>Read more about this in the <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/coronavirus/social-distancing-farm-businesses" class="govuk-link" rel="external">industry best practice guidance on social distancing</a>.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>From 6 April, you must take tests on days 2, 5 and 8 after your arrival in England even if tests on days 2 and 5 from a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr>) test or rapid lateral flow test return negative results. This is essential to protect your community from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Rapid lateral flow test tests are free and you will be able to access them by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-workplace-coronavirus-tests" class="govuk-link">workplace testing</a>, if your employer has signed up for this</li>
  <li>ordering rapid lateral flow tests to be sent to you via the workplace testing offer</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://find-covid-19-rapid-test-sites.maps.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace sites</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-covid-19-lateral-flow-test-site">community testing sites (subject to availability in your local area)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Take a rapid lateral flow test</h3>

<p>You can take a rapid lateral flow test in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at home - this is a self-reported test where you take the test yourself and report your own result</li>
  <li>under the supervision of a trained operator - this is an assisted test where the operator processes the test and reports the result</li>
</ul>

<p>Your employer should tell you who the trained operator is.</p>

<p>You could be fined if you do not do this. You may receive phone calls checking that you have taken the tests.</p>

<h3>What to do if you test positive</h3>

<p>You must self-isolate immediately. Your cohort group also needs to self-isolate. You could be fined if you do not do this.</p>

<p>You and your cohort group may be entitled to a one-off payment of £500 through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme">NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a> if you are required to self-isolate.</p>

<p>You should also take a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test"><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test</a> as soon as possible if your rapid lateral flow test result is positive.</p>

<p>You should follow <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/what-your-test-result-means/" class="govuk-link">guidance on receiving a coronavirus (COVID-19) test result</a>.</p>

<p>If you take the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test within 2 days of the rapid lateral flow test and receive a negative result, you and your cohort group can stop self-isolating.</p>

<p>You and your cohort group must continue to self-isolate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test result is positive</li>
  <li>you receive a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test result but the test was taken more than 2 days after the rapid lateral flow test</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you get coronavirus symptoms</h2>

<p>You should <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">apply for a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr>) test</a> if you get any of the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new continuous cough</li>
  <li>high temperature</li>
  <li>loss of or change to your sense of smell or taste</li>
</ul>

<p>You can call NHS 119 to arrange for a test if you do not have access to the internet.</p>

<p>You must self-isolate for both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 10 days from when your symptoms started</li>
  <li>until you are better and no longer have a high temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>If you still have a high temperature after 10 days or are otherwise unwell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stay at home</li>
  <li>seek medical advice</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not have symptoms but test positive for COVID-19 you must self-isolate for 10 days starting from the day the test was taken.</p>

<p>If you test positive you will be asked to share your contacts with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace service</a>. The information you gave in your Passenger Locator Form may be used to alert people who travelled to the UK with you.</p>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://111.nhs.uk/">NHS 111 online coronavirus (COVID-19) service</a>, or call NHS 111 if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms</li>
  <li>your condition gets worse</li>
  <li>your symptoms do not get better after 7 days</li>
</ul>

<p>For a medical emergency dial 999.</p>

<h3>Others in your household or cohort group</h3>

<p>If you develop symptoms, the household or group (cohort) you live  and work with will also need to self-isolate for 10 days.</p>

<h2>After your first 10 days in England</h2>

<p>If offered, you should continue to take 2 rapid lateral flow tests every week while you are working on the farm.</p>

<p>You must also comply with the other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing">rules for England</a>.</p>

<h2>Employing seasonal workers from overseas</h2>

<p>Follow this guidance if you are a grower, labour provider or agency bringing workers from overseas to work on farms in England.</p>

<p>You must make sure that workers have documentary evidence to confirm that they are travelling to your farm to carry out seasonal agricultural work. Workers must have these documents before they travel.</p>

<p>Within 2 hours of workers arriving at the farm, you must give them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear instructions about their working and living arrangements</li>
  <li>translated guidance on any local restrictions</li>
  <li>guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">social distancing</a>
</li>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/coronavirus/social-distancing-farm-businesses">industry guidance on social distancing</a></li>
  <li>information about rapid lateral flow testing, and how you will help them meet these requirements</li>
  <li>information on what to do if they have symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>You should ask workers to confirm in writing that they have received and understood this information. You should provide translation services if these are needed.</p>

<p>For the first 10 days you should put workers into groups of up to 6, and strictly limit contact with others outside of those groups.</p>

<p>The groups should be made up of workers arriving on the farm within 24 hours of each other.</p>

<p>You can decide how big the cohort groups are (up to 6), taking into account how easy it will be to isolate different groups of workers on your farm if they develop coronavirus.</p>

<p>From 6 April, you should help your employees to take rapid lateral flow tests on days 2, 5 and 8. You can help them take the tests by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>implementing workplace testing arrangements - read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers" class="govuk-link">guidance for employers</a>
</li>
  <li>registering by 12 April to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-workplace-coronavirus-tests">gain access to free tests for your employees</a>
</li>
  <li>signing up for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-workplace-coronavirus-tests" class="govuk-link">home testing or other arrangements that may be available in your area</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You must make sure your operations follow <a href="https://ahdb.org.uk/coronavirus/social-distancing-farm-businesses" class="govuk-link" rel="external">industry best practice on social distancing</a>.</p>

<p>Follow guidance on what to do if an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">individual gets coronavirus symptoms</a> if anyone in the group develops symptoms.</p>

<h2>At the end of 10 days self-isolation on the farm</h2>

<p>If no one in the group tests positive or has coronavirus symptoms, employers should make sure that workers are aware of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance on dealing with suspected cases of coronavirus</li>
  <li>current guidance on staying alert and safe (social distancing), both on and off the farm</li>
</ul>

<p>You should support your employees so they are able to take 2 rapid lateral flow tests every week, or if they test positive, a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test.</p>
