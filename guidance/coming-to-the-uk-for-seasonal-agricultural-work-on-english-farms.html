<p>This is national guidance for England.</p>

<p>You and your employer must follow this guidance if you are coming to England to work on a farm as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a seasonal agricultural worker under the Seasonal Workers Pilot</li>
  <li>an EU worker with settled or pre-settled status, coming to pick fruit or vegetables</li>
</ul>

<p>What you must do when you arrive in England depends on where you have been in the 10 days before you arrive. 
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">Check whether a country or territory is listed as red, amber or green</a>.</p>

<h2>Before you travel</h2>

<p>Before you travel to the UK (from any country or territory) you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england" class="govuk-link">take a test</a> no more than 3 days before your departure date that certifies a negative result for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>You will not be allowed to enter the UK if you receive a positive test result.</p>

<p>Before you travel, you must fill in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">passenger locator form</a>. You’ll need to include the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>countries you have visited in the last 10 days</li>
  <li>details of your journey</li>
  <li>contact details</li>
  <li>the address where you will work and live in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also have to give other information.</p>

<p>On the form you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add the address in England as your home address</li>
  <li>select ‘No’ when you are asked if you need to self-isolate - this only applies if you’re travelling from an amber listed country</li>
  <li>select your occupation as ‘seasonal agricultural worker’ from the menu</li>
</ul>

<p>You must provide these details in the 48 hours before you arrive in England.</p>

<p>You will need to prove at UK border controls that you are a seasonal agricultural worker.</p>

<p>Read guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules#seasonal-agricultural-workers" class="govuk-link">what you will need to show when you arrive at the UK border</a>.</p>

<p>If you are from an amber or red list country, you should pack and carry with you enough essential supplies (including clothing, medicine and cigarettes) to cover the time from the start of your travel and the 10-day self-isolation on the farm, or managed quarantine period.</p>

<p>You should not travel if you have <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 symptoms</a>. If you develop COVID-19 symptoms when you are travelling to England, you should tell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one of the crew on your plane, boat or train</li>
  <li>the driver if you are travelling by bus or coach</li>
</ul>

<p>They will let staff in the airport, port or station know, so they can tell you what you must do when you arrive.</p>

<h2>Red list countries</h2>

<p>If you arrive from a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#red-list">red list country</a> or have been in or through any red list countries during the 10 days before you enter the UK, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/booking-and-staying-in-a-quarantine-hotel-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">book and stay in managed quarantine</a>.</p>

<h3>Travelling to the farm</h3>

<p>When your managed quarantine has ended, you can go to the farm where you will live and work. You should stay at the address you provided in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">passenger locator form</a> when you arrived at the border.</p>

<p>If you need to use public transport to get to the farm, you must wear a face covering on all public transport and in transport hubs, unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age, health or another condition. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">guidance on making and wearing a face covering</a>.</p>

<p>Stay 2 metres apart from other people where possible. You should wear a face covering if you cannot stay 2 metres apart.</p>

<p>You should follow the other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">rules for England</a> including <a href="#symptoms" class="govuk-link">what to do if you get COVID-19 symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer should place you into a group of workers that you will live and work with.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>You should continue to take a rapid lateral flow test twice a week (every 3 or 4 days) while you are working on the farm. <a href="#testing123" class="govuk-link">Read about testing</a>.</p>

<h2>Amber list countries</h2>

<p>If you arrive from an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#amber-list" class="govuk-link">amber list country</a>, you do not have to book and stay in managed quarantine, but you must self-isolate for your first 10 days in England. You must stay at the address you provided in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">passenger locator form</a> when you arrived at the border.</p>

<p>You can work on the farm if you are living there. If you do not live on the farm, you will not be able to work for the first 10 days.</p>

<h3>Travelling to the farm</h3>

<p>If you’re going to live on the farm, you must go straight to the farm from your point of arrival in the UK. Someone you will be staying with at the farm should collect you from the airport, port or station. You should wear a face covering in the vehicle.</p>

<p>If someone cannot collect you, and you need to use public transport to get to the farm, you must wear a face covering on all public transport and in transport hubs, unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age, health or another condition. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">guidance on making and wearing a face covering</a>.</p>

<p>Stay 2 metres apart from other people where possible. You should wear a face covering if you cannot stay 2 metres apart.</p>

<h3>Your first 10 days in England</h3>

<p>If you do not live on the farm you will not be able to work for the first 10 days. Read guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">how to quarantine when you arrive in England</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer should place you into a group that you will live and work with.</p>

<p>You must not leave the farm during the first 10 days unless there’s an emergency. For example, if you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>urgent medical assistance (or where your doctor has advised you to get medical assistance)</li>
  <li>to access critical public services such as social services and victim support services</li>
  <li>to go to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic#who-should-attend">funeral</a> of a close relative</li>
  <li>to fulfil a legal obligation such as take part in legal proceedings</li>
</ul>

<p>You should ask your employer or colleagues for help, or order a delivery if you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>buy groceries or other shopping</li>
  <li>collect medication</li>
</ul>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid contact with others on the farm outside of your group</li>
  <li>follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing rules</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You should follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/construction-and-other-outdoor-work" class="govuk-link">guidance on safer working</a> when carrying out work on the farm.</p>

<p>You should continue to take a rapid lateral flow test twice a week (every 3 or 4 days) while you are working on the farm. <a href="#testing123" class="govuk-link">Read about testing</a>.</p>

<h3>After your first 10 days in England</h3>

<p>You can leave the farm for any purpose. You must comply with the other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing">rules for England</a> including <a class="govuk-link" href="#symptoms">what to do if you get coronavirus symptoms</a>.</p>

<h2>Green list countries</h2>

<p>If you arrive from a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#green-list" class="govuk-link">green list country</a>, you do not have to self-isolate, but you must still take rapid lateral flow tests on day 2, day 5 and day 8 after your arrival.</p>

<h3>Travelling to the farm</h3>

<p>You can live on the farm or elsewhere. You should stay at the address you provided in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">passenger locator form</a> when you arrived at the border.</p>

<p>If you need to use public transport to get to the farm, you must wear a face covering on all public transport and in transport hubs, unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age, health or another condition.

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Rapid lateral flow tests are free. Ask your employer about workplace testing or you can get tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">home collect or from a pharmacy</a></li>
  <li>at <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://find-covid-19-rapid-test-sites.maps.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/">NHS Test and Trace sites</a>
</li>
  <li>at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-covid-19-lateral-flow-test-site" class="govuk-link">community testing sites (subject to availability in your local area)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may leave the farm to collect or take a test.</p>

<h3>Take a rapid lateral flow test</h3>

<p>You can take a rapid lateral flow test on the farm. This is a self-reported test where you take the test yourself and report your own result.</p>

<p>Ask your employer if you need help taking a rapid lateral flow test.</p>

<p>You could be fined if you do not take a test on day 2, day 5 and day 8. You may receive phone calls to check you have taken the tests.</p>

<p>You should report the result by following the information included with the testing kit. Reporting your result is important to keep yourself and others safe.</p>

<h3>What to do if you test positive</h3>

<p>You must self-isolate immediately. Other members of your group must also self-isolate. You could be fined if you do not do this.</p>

<p>You should also take a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr>) test</a> as soon as possible if your rapid lateral flow test result is positive.</p>

<p>You should follow <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/what-your-test-result-means/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on receiving a coronavirus (COVID-19) test result</a>.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test is negative, and was taken within 2 days of the positive rapid lateral flow test, you and the members of your group can stop self-isolating.</p>

<p>You and members of your group must continue to self-isolate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test result is positive</li>
  <li>you receive a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test result but the test was taken more than 2 days after the rapid lateral flow test</li>
  <li>your rapid lateral flow test is positive and you do not take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<p>You and members of your  group may be entitled to a one-off payment of £500 through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a> if you are required to self-isolate.</p>

<h2>If you get coronavirus symptoms</h2>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/" class="govuk-link">apply for a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test</a> if you get any of the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new continuous cough</li>
  <li>high temperature</li>
  <li>loss of or change to your sense of smell or taste</li>
</ul>

<p>You can call NHS 119 to arrange for a test if you do not have access to the internet.</p>

<p>You should self-isolate for both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 10 days from when your symptoms started</li>
  <li>until you are better and no longer have a high temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>If you still have a high temperature after 10 days or are otherwise unwell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stay at home</li>
  <li>seek medical advice</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not have symptoms but test positive for COVID-19 you must self-isolate for 10 days starting from the day after you first test positive.</p>

<p>If you test positive you will be asked to share your contacts with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works">NHS Test and Trace service</a>. This includes each person in the group that you live and work with. The information you gave in your passenger locator form may be used to alert people who travelled to the UK with you.</p>

<p>Use the <a rel="external" href="https://111.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS 111 online coronavirus (COVID-19) service</a>, or call NHS 111 if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms</li>
  <li>your condition gets worse</li>
  <li>your symptoms do not get better after 7 days</li>
</ul>

<p>For a medical emergency dial 999.</p>

<h3>Others in your group</h3>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19, members of the group you live and work with will also need to self-isolate for 10 days from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when your symptoms started</li>
  <li>the date after your test was taken, if you do not have symptoms but have tested positive</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employing seasonal workers from overseas</h2>

<p>Follow this guidance if you are a grower, labour provider or agency bringing workers from overseas to work on farms in England.</p>

<p>You should make sure that workers have documentary evidence to confirm that they are travelling to your farm to carry out seasonal agricultural work. Workers must have these documents before they travel which they can show to border officials at the UK border.</p>

<p>Within 2 hours of workers arriving at the farm, you should give them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear instructions about their working and living arrangements</li>
  <li>translated guidance on any local restrictions</li>
  <li>guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">social distancing</a>
</li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/coronavirus/social-distancing-farm-businesses" class="govuk-link">industry guidance on social distancing</a></li>
  <li>information about rapid lateral flow testing, and how you will help them meet these requirements</li>
  <li>information on what to do if they have symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>You should ask workers to confirm in writing that they have received and understood this information. You should provide translation services if these are needed.</p>

<h3>Grouping workers together</h3>

<p>You should put workers into groups of up to 6, and strictly limit contact with others outside of those groups. Workers should live and work in these groups.</p>

<p>You should group all workers from amber list countries together. Amber list country groups should be made up of workers arriving on the farm within 24 hours of each other.</p>

<p>You can group workers from green list countries with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>workers from amber list countries who have already completed 10 days of self-isolation</li>
  <li>workers from red list countries who have completed 10 days in managed quarantine</li>
</ul>

<p>You can decide how big the groups are, taking into account how easy it will be to isolate different groups of workers on your farm if they develop coronavirus.</p>

<p>Follow guidance on what to do if an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">individual gets coronavirus symptoms</a> if anyone in the group develops symptoms.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>You should help your employees from amber and green list countries to take rapid lateral flow tests on days 2, 5 and 8.</p>

<p>Businesses that registered by 12 April can order free tests until 30 June. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-workplace-coronavirus-tests" class="govuk-link">Get coronavirus tests for your employees</a>.</p>

<p>If you did not register you can choose to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>buy your own tests and set up your own workplace testing</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing" class="govuk-link">pay an approved provider</a> to provide tests or run a test site for you</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot set up workplace testing, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask your employees to check if they can <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">get a rapid lateral flow test at home or at a test site on NHS.UK</a>
</li>
  <li>sign up for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-workplace-coronavirus-tests">home testing or other arrangements that may be available in your area</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You should continue to support your employees so they are able to take a rapid lateral flow test twice a week (every 3 or 4 days), or if they test positive, a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction test">PCR</abbr> test.</p>
