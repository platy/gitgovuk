<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lithuania/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>If you intend to live and work in Lithuania for longer than 3 months between January to June, or July to December, starting from your first day of entry into Lithuania, you must apply for a residence permit from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.migracija.lt/index.php?-1497548128">Migration Department</a> under the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Lithuania.</p>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there are changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Lithuania</a>.</p>

<h4 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h4>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You must retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register for healthcare as a resident in Lithuania, and if necessary, for health insurance.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-lithuania/">NHS guidance on healthcare in Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Lithuania and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You must apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Lithuania, you must not use a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Lithuania.</p>

<p>When you travel from Lithuania for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country.</p>

<p>During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">foreign travel insurance</a>

<h4 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h4>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Lithuania will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Lithuania.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident, you must review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>You must confirm your residency status and decide how you will ensure access to healthcare if there’s no deal.</p>

<p>If you currently have your healthcare costs paid for by the UK government, we can help if you are asked to pay for treatment during the first 6 months after Brexit. To organise a payment, you must give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>The UK has offered to continue paying the country you live in for your healthcare in the event of no deal, just as it does now. The government has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Lithuania for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020.  If there’s no deal, and there is no arrangement with Lithuania to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid if there’s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme if there’s no deal, however this is reliant on Lithuania continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>Read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-lithuania/">healthcare in Lithuania and how it may change after Brexit</a>.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">apply for a UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>If there’s a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Lithuania to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>Read guidance on:</p>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<p>If the end date on your form is after 31 October 2019, you should contact the relevant EU, EEA or Swiss authority to confirm whether you need to start paying social security contributions in that country after 31 October, as well as UK National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h4 id="money-and-tax-after-brexit">Money and tax after Brexit</h4>

<p>Brexit will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Lithuania. Direct your questions about double taxation relief to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, it may become more expensive to use your bank card in Lithuania. If you intend to use a bank card, read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial services in the EU if there’s no deal</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Lithuania, you can claim:</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK state pensions</h4>

<p>If you get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">a ‘life certificate’ form from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h4 id="pensions-after-brexit">Pensions after Brexit</h4>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay a State Pension to those eligible in the EU after Brexit. Your UK State Pension will be uprated in April 2020, 2021 and 2022 if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland.</p>

<p>If there’s a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Lithuania, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Lithuanian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions if there’s no deal.</a></p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Lithuania.</p>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit can’t be paid if you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1119&langId=en">Lithuanian social security benefits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="benefits-after-brexit">Benefits after Brexit</h4>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK state pension, child benefits and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after Brexit.</p>

<p>If there’s a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Lithuania, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Lithuanian contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-lithuania">Driving in Lithuania</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Lithuania you must exchange your UK licence for a Lithuanian licence before the UK leaves the EU. You can still use your Lithuanian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>
