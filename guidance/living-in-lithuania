<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and provides for a deal on citizens’ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the EU broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Lithuania at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Lithuania.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information</p>

<p>In the meantime, make sure you are registered as a resident in Lithuania. We will update this guidance as soon as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Lithuania before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>If you intend to live and work in Lithuania for longer than 3 months between January to June, or July to December, starting from your first day of entry into Lithuania, you must apply for a residence permit from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.migracija.lt/brexit" class="govuk-link">Migration Department</a> under the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Lithuania.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency rules or registration processes, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-lithuania">Driving in Lithuania</h2>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are a resident in Lithuania you should exchange your UK licence for a Lithuanian licence. You can still use your Lithuanian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/lithuania/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link">EU’s guidance on car registration rules and taxes in Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so, you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Lithuania</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Lithuania, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to other Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the UK and the Ireland will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you’re living in Lithuania or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Lithuania as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<p>You must register for healthcare as a resident in Lithuania, and if necessary, for health insurance.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-lithuania" class="govuk-link">guidance on who can access healthcare in Lithuania and how to register</a>.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Lithuania and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You must apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-lithuania#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Lithuania, you must not use your EHIC from the UK to access healthcare in Lithuania.</p>

<p>When you travel from Lithuania for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country.</p>

<p>During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a> and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<p>If you are resident in Lithuania on or before 31 December 2020, your right to study in Lithuania will remain the same, as long as you remain resident in Lithuania.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Lithuania to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Lithuania have not changed.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU or EEA and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Lithuania, you can claim:</p>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances" class="govuk-link">a ‘life certificate’ form from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-31-december-2020">Pensions after 31 December 2020</h3>

<p>There will be no change before 31 December 2020 to the rules on claiming the UK State Pension in the EU, EEA or Switzerland as a result of the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020 you will get your UK State Pension uprated every year for as long as you continue to live there. This will happen even if you start claiming your pension on or after 1 January 2021, as long as you meet the qualifying conditions explained in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">the new State Pension guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you are living in Lithuania by 31 December 2020, you will be able to count future social security contributions towards meeting the qualifying conditions for your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Lithuania, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Lithuanian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are considering moving to Lithuania on or after 1 January 2021 and you are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, the rules depend on negotiations with the EU and may change. Check our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/benefits-and-pensions-for-uk-nationals-in-the-eea-or-switzerland" class="govuk-link">guidance on benefits and pensions in the EU</a>.</p>

<p>You can continue to receive your UK State Pension if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland and you can still claim your UK State Pension.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are moving or retiring abroad.</p>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Lithuania.</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our guidance on which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad" class="govuk-link">benefits you can claim if you live abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad" class="govuk-link">check which benefits you can claim while you’re abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit can’t be paid if you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1119&langId=en" class="govuk-link">Lithuanian social security benefits</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals" class="govuk-link">request proof of the time you’ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-31-december--2020">Benefits after 31 December  2020</h3>

<p>There will be no changes before 31 December 2020 to the rules on claiming UK benefits in the EU, EEA or Switzerland as a result of the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020, you will continue to receive any UK benefits you already receive. This will continue for as long as you live there and meet all other eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Lithuania, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Lithuanian contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are considering moving to Lithuania on or after 1 January 2021 and you are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, the rules depend on negotiations with the EU and may change.
