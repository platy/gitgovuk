<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lithuania/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>If you intend to live and work in Lithuania for longer than 3 months between January to June, or July to December, starting from your first day of entry into Lithuania, you should apply for a residence permit from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.migracija.lt/index.php?-1497548128">Migration Department</a> under the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Lithuania.</p>

<h3 id="residency-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Lithuania</a>. In case you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document</a> or ‘emergency passport’.</p>

<h4 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU Member State, you will be able to transit through other EU Member States to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You should ensure you correctly register for healthcare as a resident in Lithuania, and if necessary, for health insurance. You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-lithuania/">NHS’s guidance on healthcare in Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Lithuania and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Lithuania, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Lithuania.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read the NHS <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lithuania/health">health advice for Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lithuania-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">find English-speaking doctors in Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Lithuania.</p>

<h4 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Lithuania will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Lithuania.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident, you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The UK has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Lithuania for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020.  If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and there is no arrangement with Lithuania to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>You should take action now to confirm your residency status and decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. UK nationals will be able to return to the UK for treatment.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal, however this is reliant on Lithuania continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>You should read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-lithuania/">healthcare in Lithuania and how it may change after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-lithuania">Working in Lithuania</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">apply for a UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<h4 id="working-in-lithuania-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Lithuania after the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lithuania-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation Period.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Lithuania to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">telling HMRC if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

</ul>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Lithuania. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lithuania-list-of-lawyers">Find an English-speaking lawyer in Lithuania</a>.</p>

<h4 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h4>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h4 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your bank card in Lithuania. If you intend to use a bank card, or other financial service from a UK-based firm in the EU after exit, this may be affected. Read more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">about using a bank card, insurance or other financial services in the EU if there is no deal</a>.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Lithuania. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation relief to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>
<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Lithuania, you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">UK State Pension</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension">new UK State Pension</a>. Contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension Centre</a> to claim</li>
  <li>your Lithuanian pension if you have worked in Lithuania, by contacting the <a rel="external" href="https://www.sodra.lt/en/?open=106">Lithuanian Social Insurance Fund</a>
</li>
  <li>pensions from working abroad, <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/retire-abroad/state-pensions-abroad/index_en.htm">if you have worked in other EU countries</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State pensions</h4>

<p>If you get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">a ‘life certificate’ form in the post</a>, you must fill it in promptly otherwise your payments may be suspended.</p>

<h4 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>The UK government will uprate your UK state pension for the fiscal year 2019/2020 in any scenario.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Lithuania, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Lithuanian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Lithuania. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our guidance on which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">benefits you can claim if you live abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">check which benefits you can claim while you’re abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit can’t be paid.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1119&langId=en">Lithuanian social security benefits</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time you’ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h4 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>The UK Government will continue to pay child benefits, and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Lithuania, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Lithuanian contributions-based benefits.</p>

<p>This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-lithuania">Driving in Lithuania</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Lithuania, you should exchange your UK licence for a Lithuanian licence, as your UK licence may not be valid after the UK leaves the EU. You can still use your Lithuanian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>You can read our guidance on:</p>

<p>You should read the <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/lithuania/index_en.htm">European Union’s guidance on car registration rules and taxes in Lithuania</a>. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so, you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h4 id="driving-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Driving after the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, driving licence rules will stay the same during the implementation period.</p>

<h4 id="voting-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Voting after the UK leaves the EU</h4>

<p>Once the UK leaves the EU, UK nationals will no longer be eligible to vote in local and European Parliament elections. We are pursuing bilateral arrangements with individual Member States to secure the right to vote for UK nationals living in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK.</p>
