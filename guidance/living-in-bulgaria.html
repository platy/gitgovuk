<h2>If you were living in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Bulgaria since before 1 January 2021.  You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizens’ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Bulgarian Government and your local authority. You should also read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria" class="govuk-link">Bulgaria travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Bulgaria, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" rel="external" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<p>If you move to Bulgaria, you may need a visa. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mfa.bg/en/services-travel/consular-services/travel-bulgaria/visa-bulgaria" rel="external">Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ guidance on visas</a>.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvr.bg/migration/en/administrative-services/administrative-servces/issue-of-residence-permits-to-third-country-nationals">Ministry of Interior information about which documents you need for different kinds of residence permits</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have been resident in Bulgaria for 5 consecutive years, you can apply to the Migration Directorate for a permanent residency permit.</p>

<h3>Applying for Bulgarian citizenship</h3>

<p>When you have held a permanent residence permit in Bulgaria for 5 years, you can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://mjs.bg/home/index/ed457278-7d44-43ec-8dc4-2193fe5710a2">apply for Bulgarian citizenship</a> (in Bulgarian).</p>

<p>You may need to renounce your UK citizenship, depending on your personal circumstances (for example, if you are not married to a Bulgarian citizen).</p>

<p>For your Bulgarian citizenship application, you may need <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate">to order a birth, marriage or death certificate from the UK</a>. You may also need a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx">UK criminal records certificate</a> in the UK.</p>

<p>You may also need to have these and other UK <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bulgaria-list-of-translators">documents officially translated</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised" class="govuk-link">legalised</a> (apostilled).</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you have lived in Bulgaria since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have rights under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should request a new residence card (документ за пребиваване) which will show that you have these rights. It will also show your right to enter Bulgaria, and exempt you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<p>The deadline for applying for the документ за пребиваване was 31 December 2021. You may need to pay a fine if you apply after this date.</p>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Bulgaria at any time in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe guidance</a>. They must travel to Bulgaria and then apply as your family member.</p>

<p>Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Bulgarian authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.airecentre.org/eurobrits-bulgaria" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Advice on Individual Rights in Europe (AIRE) Centre’s guidance on residency in Bulgaria</a> if you moved to Bulgaria before 1 January 2021.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bulgaria#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Bulgaria.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Bulgaria travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling to other EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. If you have citizenship of an EU or EFTA country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Bulgaria using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>Bulgaria is not part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you stay in Bulgaria with a Bulgarian residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day in 180 days visa-free limit in Bulgaria or for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit countries in the Schengen area, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, you should carry with you your residence document (Документ за пребиваване) or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of registration.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Bulgaria, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Bulgaria with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on your passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-bulgaria">healthcare in Bulgaria</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study" class="govuk-link">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Working in Bulgaria</h2>

<p>If you are planning to move to Bulgaria and work, you may need a visa.</p>

<p>To apply for a job you may need to provide a <a href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK criminal records check</a>, known as a DBS check.</p>

<p>You can get a Bulgarian criminal records certificate from the Judicial Records Register from any Bulgarian Regional Court (Районен съд) or from the Ministry of Justice. You can see details and download application forms at the <a rel="external" href="https://www.justice.government.bg/" class="govuk-link">Ministry of Justice website</a> (in Bulgarian).</p>

<h2>Tax</h2>

<p>In Bulgaria, you should expect to pay personal income tax and home owners’ tax. Additional taxes exist, including a vehicle tax and a fee for rubbish collection. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nra.bg/wps/portal/nra/nachalo" rel="external">National Revenue Agency</a> (in Bulgarian).</p>

<p>You should seek specialised legal advice when purchasing property in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>You can purchase buildings, apartments and real estate in Bulgaria. However, you can only purchase agricultural land if you have resided in Bulgaria for more than 5 years. UK nationals can still acquire agricultural land through inheritance.</p>
