<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>

<h2 id="brexit-healthcare">Healthcare in Malta after Brexit</h2>

<p>You should prepare for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national living in or travelling to Malta.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Malta in place. For example, if you are a posted worker or student using a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a> you will not be able to use this to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<h3 id="if-youre-living-in-malta">If you’re living in Malta</h3>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-malta#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Malta</a></li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Malta</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>

<p>Maltese <a rel="external" href="https://parlament.mt/media/100010/03223.pdf">no-deal legislation</a> (in Maltese) says that if there is a no-deal Brexit, S1 holders would continue to be able to access healthcare with their S1 form as they do now.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-malta-after-brexit">Studying in Malta after Brexit</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Malta and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Malta before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>If you are living in Malta and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free. You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>You may use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge when visiting the UK after exit day if you are living in Malta on exit day and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>This will remain the case after exit day.</p>

<h3 id="returning-the-the-uk-permanently">Returning the the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-cards-ehic">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Malta and might mean that you need pay in full for treatment. 
However, under the reciprocal healthcare provision, if you are visiting Malta for up to 30 days, you will still be able to access emergency healthcare by presenting your British passport.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Malta.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need. If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>UK-issued EHICs will still be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Malta and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Malta. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. If you are eligible for an S1 certificate you should apply now. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you are a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>If you are a UK resident studying in Malta, your student <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>The government always advises UK nationals to take out comprehensive insurance when going overseas. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not an alternative to insurance and you should have both when you travel.</p>

<p>Students may apply for a residence permit if they will be studying in Malta. Legal guardians can simultaneously apply for a residency permit to accompany that student if they are underage. The guardian must prove they have a regular and stable income.</p>

<p>This information is about healthcare in Malta before Brexit. <a href="#brexit-healthcare">Find out about healthcare for UK nationals visiting Malta after Brexit</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Malta. The government always advises UK nationals to take out comprehensive travel insurance when going overseas. Your <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>Emergency medical care only is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention either via presenting a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or under the existing 1975 Reciprocal Health Agreement (<abbr title="Reciprocal Healthcare Agreement">RHA</abbr>) provision that the UK has with Malta.</p>

<p>Under this provision if you are visiting Malta for 30 days or less, you may present your UK passport to access immediate emergency care.</p>

<p>If you are unable to present a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or valid British passport you can expect to be charged in full for any care provided. This may be reimbursed through the hospital customer care section if you show them a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> number or valid British passport.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in Malta at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free if you are staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Make sure you are treated by a healthcare provider in the state system as you will not be covered for private healthcare with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="Reciprocal Healthcare Agreement">RHA</abbr> provision.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Malta if you have a pre-existing health condition. You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, to make sure you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>The Money and Pensions Advice Service has information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions">buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take with you any documents about your health condition or medication with you.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>If you are travelling to have planned medical treatment, read the NHS guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">seeking medical treatment in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-services-in-malta">Healthcare services in Malta</h2>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>

<p>Call 112 if you have a serious, life-threatening emergency. This number is free of charge. Emergency care is provided free of cost to everyone, even those without state health insurance.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>

<p>The Maltese healthcare system consists of both private and state healthcare. The state healthcare system is funded through taxation and national insurance. Not all healthcare expenses are covered by the state system.</p>

<p>You’ll need to be referred by a doctor for any hospital treatment. Make sure you are referred to a state hospital as only these provide treatment free of charge. Even in a state hospital you will need a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. Check you are not treated as a private patient.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>

<p>You will need to pay for your prescription and seek reimbursement from the national health system.</p>

<p>If you present a prescription within 3 days of discharge from hospital you do not need to pay, and you will not have to seek reimbursement.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-own-medicines-to-malta">Bringing your own medicines to Malta</h2>

<p>Some prescribed medicines contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in the UK. This means that additional legal controls apply to these medicines.</p>

<p>You may need a personal license to take controlled medicines abroad. Specific requirements also apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the information that you must take with you</li>
  <li>how you carry your controlled medicines</li>
