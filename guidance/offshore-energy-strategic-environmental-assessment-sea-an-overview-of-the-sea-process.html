<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Strategic Environmental Assessment (<abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr>) is the process of appraisal through which environmental protection and sustainable development may be considered, and factored into national and local decisions regarding Government (and other) plans and programmes – such as oil and gas licensing rounds and other offshore energy developments, including renewables and gas and carbon dioxide storage.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> process and legislative context</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> process aims to help inform ministerial decisions through consideration of the environmental implications of the outcome of a proposed plan/programme. The Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) formerly <abbr title="Department of Trade and Industry">DTI</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform">BERR</abbr> and <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> (the department), as the principal environmental regulator of the offshore oil and gas industry, has taken a proactive stance on the use of <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> as a means of striking a balance between promoting economic development of the UK’s offshore energy resources and effective environmental protection. Although the European Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive (Directive 2001/42/EC) was not incorporated into UK law until 2004 (The Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004, and equivalent Regulations of the devolved administrations), <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEAs</abbr> have been carried out since 1999 in accordance with its requirements.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> Directive sets out the information to be included in the environmental report of the Strategic Environmental Assessment, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An outline of the contents, main objectives of the plan or programme and relationship with other relevant plans and programmes.</li>
  <li>The relevant aspects of the current state of the environment and the likely evolution thereof without implementation of the plan or programme.</li>
  <li>The environmental characteristics of areas likely to be significantly affected.</li>
  <li>Any existing environmental problems which are relevant to the plan or programme including, in particular, those relating to any areas of a particular environmental importance, such as areas designated pursuant to Directives 2009/147/EC and 92/43/EEC (the Birds and Habitats Directives).</li>
  <li>The environmental protection objectives, established at international, Community or member state level, which are relevant to the plan or programme and the way those objectives and any environmental considerations have been taken into account during its preparation.</li>
  <li>The likely significant effects on the environment, including issues such as biodiversity, population, human health, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, cultural heritage including architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors.</li>
  <li>The measures envisaged to prevent, reduce and, as fully as possible, offset any significant adverse effects on the environment of implementing the plan or programme.</li>
  <li>An outline of the reasons for selecting the alternatives dealt with and a description of how the assessment was undertaken, including any difficulties (such as technical deficiencies or lack of know-how) encountered in compiling the required information.</li>
  <li>A description of the measures envisaged concerning monitoring.</li>
  <li>A non-technical summary of the information provided under the above headings.</li>
</ul>

<p>These effects should include secondary, cumulative, synergistic, short, medium and long term, permanent and temporary, positive and negative effects.</p>

<p>The department undertook a sequence of oil and gas <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEAs</abbr> considering various areas of the <abbr title="UK Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr> (<abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> areas 1-8), in addition to an <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> for Round 2 wind leasing. The more recent offshore energy <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEAs</abbr> (<abbr title="Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment">OESEA</abbr>, <abbr title="Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment 2">OESEA2</abbr> and <abbr title="Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment 3">OESEA3</abbr>) incorporated the entire <abbr title="UK Continental Shelf">UKCS</abbr> (with the exception of Northern Ireland and Scottish territorial waters for renewable energy, and Scottish territorial waters for carbon dioxide transport and storage), for technologies including oil and gas exploration and production, gas storage and offloading including carbon dioxide transport and storage, and renewable energy (including wind, wave and tidal power). A summary of the areas covered by previous <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEAs</abbr>, when they were undertaken and for which sectors, and an overview of each of the technologies covered by the latest <abbr title="Department of Energy and Climate Change">DECC</abbr> offshore energy plan/programme is provided in the documents below.</p>

<p>As these <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEAs</abbr> have been carried out, the process has evolved and been improved.  The evolution and refinement of the process will continue. A required part of <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> is consultation with the public, environmental authorities and other bodies, together with such neighbouring states as may be potentially affected.</p>

<p>In conducting the <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> process, the Department is guided by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-advisory-groups/offshore-energy-sea-steering-group" title="Offshore SEA Steering Group"><abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> Steering Group</a>, composed of departmental representatives, conservation and other agencies, <abbr title="Non-governmental organisations">NGOs</abbr>, industry representatives and independent experts. The diverse members’ role is to act as technical peers, guiding the selection of <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> methods and identifying the right information sources.</p>

<p>Completed studies relating to earlier <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEAs</abbr> are located on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bgs.ac.uk/technologies/databases/strategic-environmental-assessment-sea-data-portal/" rel="external" title="BGS SEA archive">British Geological Survey (<abbr title="British Geological Survey">BGS</abbr>) <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> archive</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> Recommendations</h2>
<p>A series of recommendations have been made in the previous offshore energy <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> Environmental Reports on <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> processes and conclusions, the natural and wider environment, and regulatory and other controls.  A compilation of these recommendations and their current status (whether closed, in progress or still open) is available for download below.</p>

<h2>Appropriate Assessment</h2>

<p>Following announcement of a Seaward Licensing Round or following receipt of applications for licences made under each Seaward Licensing Round, a screening assessment is undertaken by the department to determine whether the award of any of the Blocks offered or applied for would be likely to lead to a significant effect on a relevant site, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects. Those sites and related Blocks for which a potential for likely significant effect is identified at the screening stage are subject to further assessment (Appropriate Assessment, (<abbr title="Appropriate Assessment">AA</abbr>)) prior to the Oil &amp; Gas Authority (OGA) making a decision on whether to grant licences. These assessments are undertaken to comply with obligations under the Offshore Petroleum Activities (Conservation of Habitats) Regulations 2001 (as amended).</p>

<p>The 32nd Seaward Licensing Round closed for applications on 12th November 2019. Applications were received covering 234 whole or part Blocks and of those, 82 Blocks were identified as requiring further assessment (Appropriate Assessment, (<abbr title="Appropriate Assessment">AA</abbr>)) prior to the Oil &amp; Gas Authority (OGA) making a decision on whether to grant licences. The assessments covering these Blocks have been documented in three draft regional reports covering areas of the West of Shetland, Central North Sea, and Southern North Sea, and were subject to public consultation.</p>

<p>The reports were revised as appropriate in light of comments received during the public consultation which ended on 7th April 2020.</p>

<p>The reports listed below document the further assessment undertaken in relation to Blocks subject to <abbr title="Appropriate Assessment">AA</abbr> in the previous ten Seaward Licensing Rounds.</p>

<h2>How do you get involved?</h2>

<h3>Consultation</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment">OESEA</abbr> consultation process has been designed to be in keeping with the Cabinet Office guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consultation-principles-guidance" title="Consultation principles">Consultation Principles</a> for engaging stakeholders when developing policy and legislation. The guidance does not have any statutory basis and therefore where there are mandatory consultation requirements set out in legislation, or other requirements which may affect a consultation such as confidentiality, these must be adhered to.</p>

<p>The main elements of public and stakeholder consultation and input to the offshore energy <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> process are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Publication through the Department’s offshore <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> webpages</li>
  <li>Scoping</li>
  <li>Stakeholder meetings and expert assessment workshops</li>
  <li>A suitable public consultation period following publication of the Environmental Report</li>
  <li>Post consultation report</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scoping</h3>
<p>The objective of scoping is to identify the main issues of concern at an early stage so that they can be considered in appropriate detail in the <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr>. Scoping also aids in the identification of information sources and data gaps that may need to be filled by studies or surveys to underpin the assessment. The <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> process includes a formal scoping step, the principal purposes of which are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promote stakeholder awareness of the <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> initiative</li>
  <li>Ensure access to all relevant environmental information</li>
  <li>Identify opportunities for potential collaboration and the avoidance of duplication of effort</li>
  <li>Identify information gaps so these could be evaluated and filled if necessary</li>
  <li>Identify stakeholder issues and concerns which should be considered in the <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stakeholder and other workshops</h3>
<p>A number of workshops have been undertaken prior to each <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr>. These have included expert assessment workshops, which bring together the expertise of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-advisory-groups/offshore-energy-sea-steering-group" title="Offshore SEA Steering Group"><abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> Steering Group</a>, the authors of underpinning technical reports, other users of the offshore area and the <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> team to bear on the assessment process for the particular <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr>. Additionally, stakeholder workshops are held involving a wide variety of potential stakeholders, drawn from other government departments, local authorities, other industry bodies, academics and <abbr title="Non-governmental organisations">NGOs</abbr>. The objectives of <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> stakeholder workshops are to provide stakeholders with updates on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK offshore energy supply context</li>
  <li>The outcome of scoping</li>
  <li>How issues raised in scoping are being addressed in the <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> process and consultation document</li>
  <li>The outcomes of the assessment workshop</li>
  <li>Initial conclusions of the overall assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>Stakeholder input and a summary of issues raised in the meeting is used to inform the <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> process, and is document and included in an appendix to the environmental report.</p>

<h3>Formal consultation</h3>
<p>The environmental report is published for formal public consultation. The publication of the environmental report is advertised in the popular press and specialist journals. Copies of the report are made available free of charge as electronic copies which can be requested via email or downloaded directly from gov.uk, and as paper versions provided by post, provided that it is reasonably practicable to do so.  Comments are invited by post or email.</p>

<h3>Post consultation report</h3>
<p>Following closure of the consultation period, the comments are given due consideration and a post consultation report is then produced. The post consultation report is published on the offshore <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> consultation webpage and made available as a download. Along with the post consultation report, a compilation of the consultation comments are published verbatim (according to the authors’ wishes).</p>

<h3>Adoption statement</h3>
<p>Following publication of the post consultation report, a ministerial statement is made to confirm the outcome of the <abbr title="Strategic Environmental Assessment">SEA</abbr> process (e.g. on adoption of the plan/programme, to proceed with further oil and gas licensing).</p>
