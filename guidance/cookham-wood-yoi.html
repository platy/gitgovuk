<h2>Book and plan your visit to Cookham Wood</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Cookham Wood you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit at least 3 working days in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-cookham-wood">required ID</a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>The young person can have up to 3 adults and 3 children (under 18) at each visit. At least one visitor must be an adult.</p>

<p>If the young person is on remand they can have 3 visits a week.</p>

<p>If the young person has been convicted (they have been sentenced or are awaiting sentencing) they can have one visit a week.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children.</p>

<p>There will be refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Cookham Wood. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<h3>Dress code</h3>

<p>Cookham Wood operates an appropriate dress code policy. Failure to adhere to this may result in your visit being refused.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<p>Family days give young people a chance to spend time with their family.</p>

<p>The young person will need to apply for a family day. If the application is successful you can spend the day with them at Cookham Wood and meet the staff who care for them.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Cookham Wood</h2>

<p>You may not be able to speak with someone at Cookham Wood during their first few days. This is because it can take time to approve who they can be in touch with.</p>

<p>Room phones do not accept incoming calls so the young person will always need to call you rather than you call them. However, as a parent or carer you will be given a phone number for your young person’s caseworker (during the first week) so that you can contact them if you have concerns.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Every person in Cookham Wood has a phone in their room and can make outgoing calls. They are given £2 credit for calls when they arrive.</p>

<p>A person in Cookham Wood can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by the casework team.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Cookham Wood using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Werrington.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>Include the person’s name and prison number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Cookham Wood</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>
