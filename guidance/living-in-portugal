<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/portugal/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Portugal</a>.</p>

<p>You must register as a Portuguese resident if you want to stay in Portugal for more than 3 months. Register at your local Câmara Municipal (town hall) in order to access services such as healthcare, schools and social security. You can find more information from the European Union about <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/documents-formalities/registering-residence/portugal/index_en.htm">registering in Portugal</a>.</p>

<p>After 5 years of legal residence in Portugal, you may <a rel="external" href="https://www.sef.pt/en/Pages/homepage.aspx">apply for permanent residence with the Portuguese immigration authorities (Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras or SEF)</a>.</p>

<p>After the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you may need to change your registration document for a new card. We will update this guidance when we know how and when this will happen.</p>

<p>For more information you can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.portaldiplomatico.mne.gov.pt/images/pdf/Folheto_Brexit_EN.PDF">Portuguese government’s leaflet on your residency rights after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Further information is available at the <a rel="external" href="https://www.portaldiplomatico.mne.gov.pt/politica-externa/brexit">Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs web page</a> (in Portuguese).</p>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-portugal">sign up to our email alerts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">apply for or renew your British passport from Portugal</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/portugal">travel advice for Portugal</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and EFTA country, within any 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and EFTA country to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You should ensure you are properly registered for healthcare as a resident in Portugal, as well as registering, where necessary, with a health insurer.</p>

<p>Once you are registered as a resident in Portugal, you are entitled to state healthcare. You need to enrol at your local health centre (centro de saúde) and get a user’s <abbr title="identity">ID</abbr> number (health number) by showing your residence certificate.</p>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-portugal-including-madeira/"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> guidance on healthcare in Portugal and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Portugal and receive an exportable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Portugal, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to access healthcare in Portugal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you may use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">advice on foreign travel insurance</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are registered with Portuguese Social Security, you should apply for a Portuguese-issued European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) for visits outside of Portugal. You won’t get a Portuguese Social Security number (<abbr title="Número de Identificação de Segurança Social">NISS</abbr>) unless you’re working or are the dependent of someone who’s working in Portugal.  The Portuguese government has more <a rel="external" href="http://www.seg-social.pt/pedido-cartao-europeu-seguro-doenca">information on how to apply</a> (in Portuguese). Your Portuguese <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid until the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/portugal-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">English-speaking doctors in Portugal</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Portugal.</p>

<p>Send questions about access to healthcare in Portugal to <a href="mailto:healthcare.portugal@fco.gov.uk">healthcare.portugal@fco.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, your current rights of access to healthcare in Portugal will remain the same for as long as you remain a resident in Portugal.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, and you are registered for healthcare based on your residency, your healthcare will be protected. If you are registered for healthcare in any other way, your access may change and you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, and there is no arrangement with Portugal to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving cover through the S1 form will need to change how they are currently registered, and register with their local health centre on the basis of residence.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid in the event the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is seeking agreement with Portugal on reciprocal healthcare arrangements for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals after <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s exit.</p>

<p>If you are registered with the Portuguese Social Security, you can be issued with a Portuguese <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> that will be valid in any <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and EEA member state. Your Portuguese <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You should also buy <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">comprehensive travel insurance</a> to cover anything not covered by your Portuguese <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or for travel to countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-portugal-including-madeira/"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> guidance on healthcare</a> for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals living in Portugal and how it may change after <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="working-and-studying-in-portugal">Working and studying in Portugal</h2>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in Portugal, you have the right to work in Portugal. Read our guidance on  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for a:</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If you are planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/portugal-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves without a deal, Portugal will continue to recognise the professional qualifications of those who are legally working in Portugal on leave date.</p>

<h3 id="british-qualifications">British qualifications</h3>

<p>If you are studying, you may need to have your British qualifications recognised in Portugal. You will need to contact:</p>

<p>You can get a <a rel="external" href="http://www.notarios.pt/OrdemNotarios/PT/PrecisoNotario/PortugueseNotarieswhospeakforeignlanguages/AreaPublica_AcessoRapido_Idiomas2.htm">local notary</a> to authenticate the translation of your diploma or school report.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a double-taxation agreement with Portugal to make sure that people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>If you are a Portuguese resident, you must declare your global income to the Portuguese authorities, no matter which country it came from. If you are not a resident, you will only pay tax on income that came from Portugal.</p>

<p>If you are liable to pay tax in Portugal, you should <a rel="external" href="http://info.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pt/apoio_contribuinte/Folhetos_informativos/Documents/Help_Senhas_Autenticacao_PF_EN.pdf">apply for a tax number</a>(Número de Identificação Fiscal or <abbr title="número fiscal de contribuinte">NIF</abbr>). You will also need a <abbr title="número fiscal de contribuinte">NIF</abbr> if you intend to buy or sell property, open a bank account or sign long-term rental agreements.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your bank card in Portugal.

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will not change existing double taxation arrangements for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals living in Portugal. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Portugal, you can claim:</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government will continue to pay the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> state pension to those eligible in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> after the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Portugal, you will still be able to add your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> social security contributions towards your Portuguese pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period. Your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> state pension will also continue to be uprated as long as you are correctly registered as a resident in Portugal by the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions</a>. The Portuguese government will continue to take into account periods of work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> before the date the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> when calculating your Portuguese pension.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government will uprate your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> state pension for the fiscal year 2019/2020 in any scenario.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Portugal. You should:</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">use our tool to check which benefits you can claim while you are abroad</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> income-related benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit cannot be paid to you.</p>

<p>You may also be eligible to claim some <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1125&langId=en">Portuguese social security benefits</a>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Portugal, your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Portuguese contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, the Portuguese government has proposed they will continue to take periods of work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> before the date the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> into account when claiming Portuguese contributions-based benefits.

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, driving licence rules will stay the same during the implementation period (until 31 December 2020).</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, and you are resident in Portugal, you will be required to exchange your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licence for a Portuguese one.
