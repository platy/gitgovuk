<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup?topic=%2Fbrexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-in-the-czech-republic-after-brexit">Healthcare in the Czech Republic after Brexit</h2>

<p id="HealthcareCzechRepublic">You should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national visiting or living in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with the Czech Republic in place.</p>

<p>For example, if you are a current S1 form holder, or a posted worker or student using a <a href="#EHIC">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a> you will not be able to rely on these to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-live-in-the-czech-republic">If you live in the Czech Republic</h3>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-czech-republic#visas-and-residency">registering to live in the Czech Republic</a></li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of the Czech Republic</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency, or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<p>If you are resident in the Czech Republic, you can choose to join one of the government-approved statutory health insurance schemes, giving you the same access to healthcare as Czech nationals. Statutory health insurance is provided by 7 different government-approved insurers.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>

<p>Your S1 certificate may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with the Czech Republic and might mean you have to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-the-czech-republic-after-brexit">Studying in the Czech Republic after Brexit</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with the Czech Republic and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in the Czech Republic before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free if you are living in the Czech Republic and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>If you are living in the Czech Republic before Brexit, you can use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge after exit day if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="EHIC">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with the Czech Republic and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need.</p>

<p>If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

</div>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in the Czech Republic and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in the Czech Republic. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>When you move to the Czech Republic, you will need to register your S1 certificate with one of the local healthcare insurance funds and receive their insurance card.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you are a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit.</p>

<p>You can find more information under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. Use of an ambulance or air ambulance is free where this is deemed necessary.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in the Czech Republic at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free, if you are staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Make sure you are treated by a healthcare provider that has a contract with any of the Czech state healthcare insurance funds. An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will not cover you for private (non-contracted) healthcare. You will not be able to claim back any private healthcare costs.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting the Czech Republic if you have a pre-existing health condition.</p>

<p>You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>The Money and Pensions Advice Service has information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions">buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medicine with you.</p>

<p>If you are travelling to have planned medical treatment, read the NHS guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">seeking medical treatment in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-services-in-the-czech-republic">Healthcare services in the Czech Republic</h2>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>

<p>If you have a serious or life-threatening emergency in the Czech Republic, dial 112. Calls are free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="dentists">Dentists</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers you for necessary dental services when visiting the Czech Republic, but there’s a standard fee of 90CZK for emergency dental services. This charge is non-refundable.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>

<p>You need to be referred for specialist hospital treatment. Make sure you are treated by a hospital contracted to any of the Czech healthcare insurance funds. When you’re admitted to hospital, you’ll need to present a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> and your UK passport to receive treatment at the same cost as a resident.</p>

<p>A standard 90CZK charge is made for emergency hospital treatment. This charge is non-refundable.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>

<p>You may be required to make a co-payment for the costs of certain prescriptions depending on their government classification. Generally, however, residents in the Czech Republic have their prescriptions covered by statutory health insurance and will be covered by <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Doctors’ prescriptions should be taken to a pharmacy within 2 weeks of being issued, otherwise they become invalid. Prescriptions from emergency services are valid for 1 day only. Prescriptions for antibiotics must be picked up within 5 days.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-own-medicines-to-the-czech-republic">Bringing your own medicines to the Czech Republic</h2>

<p>Some prescribed medicines contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in the UK. This means that additional legal controls apply to these medicines.</p>

<p>You may need a personal licence to take controlled medicines abroad.</p>

<p>Specific requirements also apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the information you must take with you</li>
  <li>how you carry your controlled medicines</li>
</ul>
