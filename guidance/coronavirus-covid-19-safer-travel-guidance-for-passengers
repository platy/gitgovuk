<p>If you do need to travel for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november#travel" class="govuk-link">legally permitted reason</a>, you can also help control coronavirus by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>following <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social contact rules</a>
</li>
  <li>keeping your distance when you travel, where possible</li>
  <li>washing or sanitising your hands regularly</li>
  <li>avoiding the busiest routes, as well as busy times like the rush hour</li>
  <li>downloading the <a rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID-19</a> app before you travel, if possible, and checking in where you see official NHS COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code posters</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not travel at all if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been told by the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/nhs-test-and-trace-if-youve-been-in-contact-with-a-person-who-has-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace service to self-isolate</a>
</li>
  <li>are experiencing any <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus symptoms</a>
</li>
  <li>are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">self-isolating as a result of coronavirus symptoms or sharing a household or [support bubble](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household) with somebody with symptoms</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not travel if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been told by the <a rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID-19 app</a> to self-isolate</li>
  <li>are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19" class="govuk-link">clinically extremely vulnerable</a>, except to go outdoors for exercise or to attend essential health appointments</li>
</ul>

<p>These restrictions apply to England only. The rules are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-regulations-guidance-what-restrictions-mean-you" class="govuk-link">national restrictions in Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">national restrictions in Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus-firebreak-frequently-asked-questions" class="govuk-link">national restrictions in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="social-distancing">Social distancing</h2>

<p>You should maintain a 2 metre distance where possible, because the risk of transmission is small at this distance.</p>

<p>If you cannot keep a 2 metre distance, reduce the risk to yourself and others by maintaining a 1 metre distance where possible, and taking suitable precautions.</p>

<p>Help keep yourself, other passengers and transport staff safe, by taking the following precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limit the number of people or households that you come into contact with, for example by avoiding the busiest routes, as well as busy times like the rush hour</li>
  <li>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</li>
  <li>avoid touching your face</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when coughing or sneezing</li>
  <li>travel side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow</li>
  <li>touch as few surfaces as possible</li>
  <li>stay outdoors, rather than indoors, where possible</li>
  <li>minimise the time spent close to other people, where possible</li>
  <li>avoid loud talking, shouting or singing</li>
  <li>dispose of waste safely, including items such as used disposable face coverings</li>
</ul>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs in England unless you are exempt.</p>

<h2 id="social-contact">Social contact</h2>

<p>You can only travel with your household or with someone you have formed a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubble</a> with, unless you are travelling for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november#travel" class="govuk-link">legally permitted reasons</a>, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with work, for example, transport organised by an employer during the course of your work</li>
  <li>providing support to a vulnerable person</li>
  <li>providing emergency assistance, and to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm</li>
  <li>making arrangements where children do not live in the same household as both their parents or guardians</li>
  <li>training or competition, where the person concerned is an elite sportsperson</li>
  <li>where fulfilling a legal obligation such as attending court or jury service</li>
</ul>

<p>The police will be able to take action against those that break these rules, including asking people to disperse and issuing fixed penalty notices starting at Â£200 for those who participate in illegal gatherings.</p>

<p>People aged 18 or over can be fined:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£200 for the first offence, lowered to Â£100 if paid within 14 days</li>
  <li>Â£400 for the second offence, then doubling for each further offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="face-coverings">Face coverings</h2>

<p>A face covering is a covering of any type which covers your nose and mouth. Surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) should continue to be reserved for people who need to wear them at work.</p>

<p>Face coverings are not a substitute for maintaining <a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing</a> and good hand hygiene.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">How to wear and make a face covering</a>.</p>

<h3 id="where-you-must-wear-face-coverings">Where you must wear face coverings</h3>

<p>It is the law that you <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/592/contents" class="govuk-link">must wear a face covering when travelling in England</a> on public transport. Such as, on or in a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bus or coach</li>
  <li>train or tram</li>
  <li>ferry or hovercraft or other vessel</li>
  <li>taxi or private hire vehicle</li>
  <li>aircraft</li>
  <li>cable car</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also wear a face covering in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs from which passenger services operate. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>airports</li>
  <li>rail stations and terminals</li>
  <li>the Channel Tunnel terminal in Kent</li>
  <li>ports and terminals</li>
  <li>bus, coach and tram stations and terminals</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also wear a face covering in other indoor settings.</p>

<p>If you do not wear a face covering in these settings you will be breaking the law and could be fined. The fine for a first offence is Â£200, or Â£100 if you pay the fine within 14 days.</p>

<p>Repeat offenders receiving fines either on public transport or in an indoor place will have their fines doubled on each subsequent offence up to a maximum value of Â£6,400. After the first offence, there will be no discount. As an example, receiving a second fine will amount to Â£400 and a third fine will be Â£800. A sixth fine and all subsequent fines will be Â£6,400.</p>

<p>These laws apply while you are in England. If travelling from any other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nation, you will be required to wear a face covering when you enter England, regardless of the rules in the nation you are transiting from.</p>

<h3 id="other-areas-you-should-wear-a-face-covering">Other areas you should wear a face covering</h3>

<p>You must also wear a face covering by law in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">some other public places</a>, unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age or health, or if you have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">a legitimate reason not to</a>.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to also wear a face covering in other enclosed spaces where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, or where there are people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>The rule applies in situations where individuals from different households or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubbles</a> could be travelling together on a service such as a charter boat, but not if you are giving a lift to someone from another household or support bubble in your private car.</p>

<p>The rules for wearing face coverings are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/covid-19-coronavirus/covid-19-information-public#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face coverings in Northern Ireland</a></li>

  <li><a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-frequently-asked-questions" class="govuk-link">face coverings in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="face-covering-exemptions">Face covering exemptions</h3>

<p>Some people <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">donâ€™t have to wear a face covering</a> including for health, age or disability reasons.</p>

<p>Government and some operators have produced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#documents" class="govuk-link">cards and badges</a> which you can choose to wear to show you are exempt. There is no requirement to do this though, and if you rely on an exemption, transport staff should not ordinarily ask for evidence.</p>

<p>Some transport staff may also not wear a face covering if it is not required for their job.</p>

<h3 id="when-you-can-remove-your-face-covering">When you can remove your face covering</h3>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by a police officer or other relevant person.</p>

<p>You do not need to wear a face covering if you have a <a href="#legitimate-reasons-not-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">legitimate reason not to</a>.</p>

<p>Within the public area of a transport hub, passengers are able to remove their face covering in order to eat and drink when seated. They must put their face covering back on once they finish eating or drinking.</p>

<p>It is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering. For longer journeys, take more than one face covering and a plastic bag for used face coverings.</p>

<p>Please be mindful that the wearing of a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

<h3 id="disposing-of-used-face-coverings">Disposing of used face coverings</h3>

<p>Use a â€˜black bagâ€™ waste bin or litter bin to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste" class="govuk-link">dispose</a> of face coverings. You should not put face coverings in a recycling bin or drop them as litter.</p>

<h2 id="walking-and-cycling">Walking and cycling</h2>

<p>You must stay at home unless you are travelling for work, education or for other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november#travel" class="govuk-link">legally permitted reasons</a>. Where you need to travel, walk orâ€¯<a rel="external" href="https://www.think.gov.uk/cycle-safety" class="govuk-link">cycle</a>â€¯if you can.</p>

<p>This will reduce pressure on public transport and the road network.</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">local council</a> can help you plan your journey by providing maps showing dedicated paths and routes.</p>

<p>You must observe <a href="#social-contact" class="govuk-link">social contact rules</a> while walking or cycling in England.</p>

<p>Where possible,â€¯<a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">keep a suitable distance from other people</a>. For example, when waiting at crossings and traffic lights. Take precautions where this is not possible.</p>

<p>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands before and after cycling.</p>

For example, if car sharing is reasonably necessary as part of your work.</p>

<p>It is difficult to socially distance during car journeys. Where it is essential to car share, you can reduce the risk of transmission by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>opening windows for ventilation</li>
  <li>travelling side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow</li>
  <li>facing away from each other</li>
  <li>considering seating arrangements to maximise distance between people in the vehicle</li>
  <li>cleaning your car between journeys using standard cleaning products - make sure you clean door handles and other areas that people may touch</li>
  <li>asking the driver and passengers to <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">wear a face covering</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="on-your-journey">On your journey</h3>

<p>Expect more pedestrians and cyclists, especially at peak times of day. Where possible, allow other road users to <a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">maintain social distancing</a>. For example, give cyclists space at traffic lights.</p>

<p>At garages, petrol stations and motorway services try to keep your distance from other people and if possible pay by contactless.

  <li>if you need to eat, drink, or take medication on public transport</li>
  <li>if you are asked to remove your face covering by a police officer or other official, for example to check your railcard</li>

<h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement of face coverings on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs</h3>

<p>You are not allowed to get on public transport or enter substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs if you are not wearing a face covering, unless you have an <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">exemption or a legitimate reason for not wearing one</a>. Transport staff may tell you not to board or ask you to get off.</p>

<p>If you refuse to wear a face covering, you can receive a fine from the police or Transport for London enforcement officers. The fixed penalty notice will require you to pay Â£200, which is reduced to Â£100 if paid within 14 days.</p>

<p>Repeat offenders receiving fines either on public transport or in an indoor place will have their fines doubled on each subsequent offence up to a maximum value of Â£6,400. After the first offence, there will be no discount. As an example, receiving a second fine will amount to Â£400 and a third fine will be Â£800. A sixth fine and all subsequent fines will be Â£6,400.</p>
