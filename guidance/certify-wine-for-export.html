<h2>Export or move wine produced in Great Britain to the EU and Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/export-or-move-wine-complete-a-self-certificate">complete a self-certificate</a> before you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>export wine that is produced in Great Britain to the EU</li>
  <li>move wine that is produced in Great Britain to Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>Your self-certification will confirm your wine complies with EU regulations. You must attach your self-certificate to your consignment of wine when it is exported.</p>

<h3>If you’re an authorised trader moving wine to Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Supermarkets and their trusted suppliers moving wine to Northern Ireland do not need official certification. This is part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/movement-assistance-scheme-get-help-with-moving-agrifood-goods-to-northern-ireland">Movement Assistance Scheme.</a></p>

<h2>Export or move wine that is not produced in Great Britain or the EU</h2>

<p>There are steps you need to follow if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>moving wine produced in non-EU countries from Great Britain into Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>exporting wine produced in non-EU countries from Great Britain to the EU</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must also follow these steps if you are bottling wine from the EU and exporting it from Great Britain to the EU or moving it into Northern Ireland.</p>
</div>

<h3>Register with the Food Standards Agency or Food Standards Scotland</h3>

<p>All wine exporters must register with the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) or Food Standards Scotland (<abbr title="Food Standards Scotland">FSS</abbr>) before exporting.</p>

<p>To register, email the appropriate agency with the subject line ‘VI-1 exporter registration request’.</p>

<h4>If you’re in England</h4>

<p>Email the Food Standards Agency.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p>Food Standards Agency
<br>
Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:wineexportsregistration@food.gov.uk">wineexportsregistration@food.gov.uk</a></p>
</div>

<h4>If you’re in Scotland</h4>

<p>Email the Food Standards Scotland.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p>Food Standards Scotland
<br>
Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:approvals@fss.scot">approvals@fss.scot</a></p>
</div>

<h3>After you’ve registered</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> or <abbr title="Food Standards Scotland">FSS</abbr> will reply within 20 working days. You’ll then receive a Wine Standards Board (<abbr title="Wine Standards Board">WSB</abbr>) number.</p>

<p>You’ll need to provide your <abbr title="Wine Standards Board">WSB</abbr> number to the Department of Environment and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department of Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) when you apply for a EU VI-1 pro-forma.</p>

<h3>Get a laboratory analysis report</h3>

<p>Wine that is produced in the EU and bottled in Great Britain must be tested and have an analysis report. You must provide this report when you apply for your EU VI-1 pro-forma.</p>

<p>You can get a report from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-approved-uk-laboratories-for-issuing-eu-vi-1-analysis-reports">approved laboratory in the UK</a>
</li>
  <li>the EU producer you got the wine from</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply for an EU VI-1 pro-forma</h2>

<p>An EU VI-1 certifies that the wine you plan to export complies with EU regulations by showing shipment details and a technical analysis of the wine.</p>

<p>A pro-forma is issued by <abbr title="Department of Environment and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and can be used to show EU border control that you comply with EU VI-1 certification regulations.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/export-or-move-wine-apply-for-a-pro-forma-eu-vi-1-document">Apply for an EU VI-1 pro-forma.</a></p>

<h3>When you do not need EU VI-1 certification</h3>

<p>You do not need an EU VI-1 if the wine is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>moved from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</li>
  <li>imported from the EU to Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>produced and bottled in the EU or Northern Ireland and moved outside of the EU or Northern Ireland, then returned to be sold</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exemptions to moving or exporting wine</h3>

<p>You do not need EU VI-1 certification if the wine is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exported in non-commercial consignments from one private individual to another, up to a maximum of 30 litres per consignment</li>
  <li>in containers up to 10 litres with a single use stopper – the total shipment must be less than 100 litres (can be in separate consignments)</li>
  <li>for trade fairs -  the wine must be in labelled containers up to 2 litres with a single use stopper</li>
  <li>exported for the purpose of scientific and technical experiments up to a maximum of 100 litres</li>
  <li>held in stores on board ships and aeroplanes operating in international transport</li>
  <li>being traded for diplomatic purposes in accordance with the Vienna Convention or the New York Convention</li>
</ul>

<h5>Personal use and travel allowances</h5>

<p>You do not need an EU VI-1 if the wine is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your personal property and you’re moving to the EU or Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>in your personal luggage, up to a maximum of 30 litres</li>
</ul>

<h3>If your country has a trade agreement with the EU</h3>

<p>Some countries that have trade agreements with the EU are granted simplified VI-1 arrangements which might mean a full analysis of the wine is not required or that a producer can certify the VI-1 certificate.</p>

<p>This applies to wines imported to the EU and Northern Ireland from countries including Australia, Chile and the USA.</p>

<h2>If your wine export is rejected</h2>

<p>If your wine export is rejected at the border and you want to import the wine back to Great Britain you need to notify authorities.</p>
