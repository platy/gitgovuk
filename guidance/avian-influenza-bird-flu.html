<p>Avian influenza (bird flu) mainly affects birds. It can also affect humans and other mammals.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Avian influenza (bird flu) is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notifiable-diseases-in-animals">notifiable animal disease</a>. If you suspect any type of avian influenza in poultry or captive birds you must report it immediately by calling the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. In Wales, contact 0300 303 8268. In Scotland, contact your local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#scotland-field-service-offices">Field Services Office</a>. Failure to do so is an offence.</p>

<p>If you find dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Defra helpline (03459 33 55 77). <strong>Do not touch or pick up</strong> any dead or visibly sick birds that you find. For further information see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#public">advice to the public</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>All bird keepers (whether you have pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard flock) must keep a close watch on them for signs of disease and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#biosecurity">maintain good biosecurity</a> at all times. If you have any concerns about the health of your birds, seek prompt advice from your vet.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poultry-including-game-birds-registration-rules-and-forms">register your poultry</a>, even if only kept as pets, so we can contact you during an outbreak. This is a legal requirement if you have 50 or more birds. Poultry includes chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants.</p>

<p>You can sign up to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apha-alert-subscription-service">alerts service</a> to keep up to date with the latest news.

<h2>Latest situation</h2>

<h3>Update 2 March 2022</h3>

<p>Following successful completion of disease control activities and surveillance within the disease control zones surrounding a premises near Ross-on-Wye, Hereford &amp; South Herefordshire, Herefordshire, the 3km Protection Zone declared on the 20 January 2022 has ended and the Surveillance Zone has been revoked. All local restrictions have been lifted but the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone remains in force.</p>

<h3>Update 1 March 2022</h3>

<p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza (<abbr title="High pathogenicity avian influenza">HPAI</abbr>) H5N1 was confirmed in commercial poultry at a premises near Redgrave, Mid Suffolk, Suffolk. A 3km Protection Zone and 10km Surveillance Zone has been put in place around the premises. All birds on the infected premises will be humanely culled.</p>

<h3>Update 28 February 2022</h3>

<p>Following successful completion of disease control activities and surveillance within the disease control zones surrounding a premises near Louth, East Lindsey, Lincolnshire, the 3km Protection Zone declared on the 31 December 2021 has ended and the area has merged with the 10km Surveillance Zone.</p>

<p>For details of the cases and the measures that apply in the disease control zones in England, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu-cases-and-disease-control-zones-in-england">avian influenza: cases and disease control zones in England</a> guidance.

<h2>Register for ‘stop the spread’ webinars</h2>

<p>Find out what you can do to keep your birds free of avian influenza by registering for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu-stop-the-spread-webinars/stop-the-spread-webinars"><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s ‘stop the spread’ webinars</a>. New dates have been released for the gamebird sector in early March 2022.</p>

<h2>Avian Influenza Prevention Zone</h2>

<p>An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (<abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr>) came into force across Great Britain on the 3 November 2021, and in Northern Ireland on the 17 November 2021. This was extended to include housing measures across the UK on the 29 November 2021.</p>

<p>These measures mean that it is a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK (whether they have pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard flock) to keep their birds indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.</p>

<p>Separate <abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr> declarations are made in each UK administration. For further details in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>England - see the <abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr> in England section below</li>
  <li>Scotland - see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu/" rel="external">Scottish Government website</a>
</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr> in England</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr> in England means that bird keepers must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>house or net all poultry and captive birds to keep them separate from wild birds</li>
  <li>cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds – if practical, use disposable protective clothing</li>
  <li>reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control</li>
  <li>thoroughly cleanse and disinfect housing on a continuous basis</li>
  <li>keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points</li>
  <li>minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds</li>
</ul>

<p>To help bird keepers comply with the rules, we’ve updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="#biosecurity">biosecurity advice</a> .</p>

<p>For further details see the latest England declaration - in force from 29 November 2021 until further notice:</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr> requirements will be kept under regular review as part of the government’s work to monitor and manage the risks of avian influenza. Any decisions on when to lift or amend the AIPZs will be based on risk assessments based on the latest scientific and ornithological evidence and veterinary advice.</p>

<h4>Enforcement</h4>
<p>Avian influenza controls, including the <abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr> and housing measures are enforced by the Local Authority Animal Health Function (<abbr title="Local Authority Animal Health Function">LAAHF</abbr>), which is normally situated with the Trading Standards or Environmental Health Service of a local authority.</p>

<p>You should contact your local authority to find out how to raise reports of non-compliance. If you need help with this you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">ask your local council</a>.</p>

<h2>Risk level</h2>

<p>The risk of incursion of highly pathogenic (<abbr title="High pathogenicity avian influenza">HPAI</abbr>) avian influenza H5 in wild birds has increased from high (event occurs often) to very high (with low uncertainty) for England and high (with high uncertainty) for Wales and Scotland for wild birds.</p>

<p>The risk of poultry exposure to <abbr title="High pathogenicity avian influenza">HPAI</abbr> H5 across Great Britain has changed from medium (with medium uncertainty) to medium (with low uncertainty) where good biosecurity is applied, but has increased to high (with low uncertainty) where there are substantial biosecurity breaches and poor biosecurity. If, however, stringent biosecurity is in place the risk would be low for these premises.</p>

<p>All bird keepers are encouraged to maintain high standards of biosecurity as good practice for the health of their birds, and that good biosecurity is an essential defence against diseases such as avian influenza and is key to limiting the spread of avian influenza in an outbreak.</p>

<p>Further details on the evidence which supported these decisions can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu-in-europe">risk assessments</a>.</p>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has said that avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds and the risk to the general public’s health is very low.</p>

<p>The Food Standards Agency has said that on the basis of the current scientific evidence, avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.</p>

<p>Avian influenza is unconnected with coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#public">advice for the public</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Cases in the UK</h2>

<h3>Cases in England</h3>

<p>There are currently 83 cases of avian influenza H5N1 in England.</p>

<p>There were also 2 cases of avian influenza in Wales where a small area of the disease control zones extended into England. In addition there were 2 cases of avian influenza in Scotland where a small area of the surveillance zone surrounding each case extended into England.</p>

<h2>Wild birds in the UK</h2>

<h3>Wild bird surveillance in Great Britain</h3>

<p>The Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) carries out year-round avian influenza surveillance of dead wild birds submitted via public reports and warden patrols.</p>

<p>There have been multiple findings of <abbr title="High pathogenicity avian influenza">HPAI</abbr> H5N1 in wild birds from sites across GB. For further details see the report (updated weekly) of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-in-wild-birds">findings of <abbr title="High pathogenicity avian influenza">HPAI</abbr> in wild birds in Great Britain</a> and our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu-in-europe">outbreak assessments</a>.</p>

<p>If you find dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> helpline (03459 335577).</p>

<p>We then collect some of these birds and test them to help us understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird, not all birds will be collected.</p>

<p>Wild birds are susceptible to a range of diseases and injuries and not all dead birds will have been infected with avian influenza.</p>

<p>Do not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that you find. For further information see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#public">advice for the public</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) carry out routine surveillance of disease risks in the UK and around the world to help us anticipate future threats to animal health and continue to closely monitor the global situation of avian influenza as part of this work. Further details of the latest avian influenza findings in wild birds in Europe can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu-in-europe">outbreak assessments</a>.</p>

<h3>Wild bird surveillance in Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/articles/avian-influenza-ai" rel="external">DAERA-NI website</a> for further information on surveillance for avian influenza in wild birds in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>Biosecurity advice</h2>

<p>High standards of biosecurity should be maintained as good practice for the health of your birds. Good biosecurity is an essential defence against diseases such as avian influenza and is key to limiting the spread of avian influenza in an outbreak.</p>

<p>Whether an outbreak of avian influenza occurs in pet birds, a backyard flock, captive birds of prey, pigeons or a commercial flock the same disease control measures apply and the same impacts on bird keepers and trade in poultry occurs.</p>

<p>Read the biosecurity guidance which includes details of biosecurity best practice and further guidance on measures that bird keepers must take in an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone. Complete the biosecurity self-assessment checklist and retain for inspection if requested by representatives from <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> or Local Authorities.</p>

<h3>Register your birds</h3>

<p>We encourage all keepers to register their birds with us, and keep contact details up to date, so we can contact you quickly if there is a disease outbreak in your area and you need to take action.</p>

<p>If you have more than 50 birds, you are legally required to register your flock within one month of their arrival at your premises. If you have less than 50 birds, including pet birds, you are still strongly encouraged to register.</p>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/poultry-registration">how to register your birds</a>.</p>

<h3>Report signs of disease</h3>

<p>You must keep a close watch on your birds for any signs of disease, and must seek prompt advice from your vet if you have any concerns. If you suspect avian influenza you must report it immediately by calling the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. Failure to do so is an offence.</p>

<h3>Pigeons or birds of prey</h3>

<p>If your birds are within a disease control zone, make sure you check the restrictions applicable to that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu-cases-and-disease-control-zones-in-england">zone</a>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr> including housing measures is in force. Pigeons and birds of prey must be housed or where not possible kept in a fully netted ideally covered areas which keeps kept birds separate from wild birds and minimises contact with wild bird faeces, feathers etc. You can exercise and train pigeons or fly birds of prey, including for pest control, but they should avoid direct contact with wild birds. Pigeon lofts should not be left open for the birds to come and go as they please. For further information see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/934688/biosecurity-poultry-guide.pdf" rel="external">biosecurity guidance</a>.</p>

<p>You are advised not to feed any wild birds, in particular any wild shot or hunted wildfowl, to any birds of prey, during a period of heightened <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu-in-europe">risk of avian influenza infection in wild birds</a>. This includes birds that may have been shot or hunted earlier in the year, since the virus can remain viable in frozen carcases for at least 12 months.</p>

<h3>Game birds and shoots</h3>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gfa.org.uk/user_files/uploads/Bird_Flu_and_Gamebirds%20-%2018%20Nov%202021.pdf" rel="external">avian influenza and game birds guidance</a> on the Game Farmers Association website. This guidance has been prepared by game shooting, research and game conservation bodies. It is endorsed by <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and DAERA in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Once game birds have been released, they are classified as wild birds. The person who released the game birds is no longer classed as the ‘keeper’ of the birds.</p>

<p>You can continue to feed and water released game birds but you should make reasonable efforts to minimise the chance of other wild birds accessing their feed and water, for example by placing it under cover. You should use commercial feed and fresh or treated water.</p>

<p>Additional restrictions will apply when disease control zones are in place. Definitive requirements for disease control zones will be set out in published declarations. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu-cases-and-disease-control-zones-in-england">avian influenza: cases and disease control zones in England</a> guidance.</p>

<h3>Vaccination</h3>

<p>The vaccination of poultry and most captive birds against avian influenza is not currently permitted. Vaccination is not a routine control measure and is a practice restricted by legislation.</p>

<p>Vaccination of zoo birds is only permitted in England subject to meeting eligibility criteria and receiving authorisation. Only zoos or collections holding a current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/zoo-licence">zoo licence</a> can apply for an authorisation to vaccinate. For further information see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu-vaccination">avian influenza vaccination guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>How to spot avian influenza</h2>

<p>There are 2 types of avian influenza.</p>

<p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza (<abbr title="High pathogenicity avian influenza">HPAI</abbr>) is the more serious type. It is often fatal in birds. The main clinical signs of <abbr title="High pathogenicity avian influenza">HPAI</abbr> in birds (which can include any or a combination of the following) are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sudden and rapid increase in the number of birds found dead</li>
  <li>several birds affected in the same shed or air space</li>
  <li>swollen head</li>
  <li>closed and excessively watery eyes</li>
  <li>lethargy and depression</li>
  <li>recumbency and unresponsiveness</li>
  <li>incoordination and loss of balance</li>
  <li>head and body tremoring</li>
  <li>drooping of the wings and/or dragging of legs</li>
  <li>twisting of the head and neck</li>
  <li>swelling and blue discolouration of comb and wattles</li>
  <li>haemorrhages on shanks of the legs and under the skin of the neck</li>
  <li>loss of appetite or marked decrease in feed consumption</li>
  <li>sudden increase or decrease in water consumption</li>
  <li>respiratory distress such as gaping (mouth breathing), nasal snicking (coughing sound), sneezing, gurgling or rattling</li>
  <li>fever or noticeable increase in body temperature</li>
  <li>discoloured or loose watery droppings</li>
  <li>cessation or marked reduction in egg production</li>
</ul>

<p>Clinical signs can vary between species of bird and some species (for example ducks and geese) may show minimal clinical signs.</p>

<p>Low pathogenic avian influenza (<abbr title="Low pathogenicity avian influenza">LPAI</abbr>) is usually less serious and may show more vague clinical signs. It can cause mild breathing problems and reduction of egg production, but affected birds will not always show clear signs of infection.</p>

<p>The severity of <abbr title="Low pathogenicity avian influenza">LPAI</abbr> depends on the type of bird and whether it has any other illnesses.</p>

<p>Anyone who keeps poultry must keep a close watch on them for any signs of disease, and must seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns.</p>

<h3>Photos of clinical signs</h3>

<p>We’ve published some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/defragovuk/sets/72157694543861305" rel="external">photos of clinical signs of avian influenza</a> on Flickr.</p>

<h3>How avian influenza is spread</h3>

<p>Avian influenza spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear.</p>

<p>The avian influenza virus changes frequently, creating new strains, and there is a constant risk that one of the new strains may spread easily among people.</p>

<p>Avian influenza isn’t an airborne virus.</p>

<h2>Advice for the public</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Support for the farming community</h3>
<p>We work in partnership with Farming Help organisations to support their work to help the farming community through challenging times. If this affects you, please either contact them on 03000 111 999 or visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.farminghelp.co.uk/" rel="external">Farming Help website</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Public health</h3>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has said that avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds and the risk to the general public’s health is very low. The regional <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Health Protection Teams are working closely with <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> to monitor the situation and will be providing health advice to persons at the infected premises as a precaution.</p>

<p>The Food Standards Agency has said that on the basis of the current scientific evidence, avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bird-flu/prevention" rel="external">NHS website</a> has further information and if you employ people who work with poultry or work with poultry yourself, you can also read <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/diseases/influenza.htm" rel="external">Health and Safety Executive advice on protecting workers from avian influenza</a>.</p>

<h3>Wild birds</h3>

<p>Do not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that you find.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, if you find dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> helpline (03459 33 55 77).</p>

<p>We then collect some of these birds and test them to help us understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird, not all birds will be collected. Wild birds are susceptible to a range of diseases and injuries and not all dead birds will have been infected with avian influenza.</p>

<p>We publish a report (updated regularly) on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-in-wild-birds">findings of highly pathogenic avian influenza (bird flu) in wild birds</a> in Great Britain and provide further details in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu-in-europe">outbreak assessments</a>.</p>

<p>Where dead birds are not required for surveillance purposes it is the landowner’s responsibility to safely dispose of the carcases.</p>

<p>The carcasses of wild animals, other than wild game, are exempt from the animal by-product (ABP) rules in the UK. However, if it is suspected that the animals were infected with a disease which can spread to people or animals such as avian influenza, the carcases must be disposed of as a category 1 ABP. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal">guidance on animal by-product disposal</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/articles/avian-influenza-ai" rel="external">DAERA-NI website</a> for further information on surveillance for avian influenza in wild birds in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>Disposal of dead wild birds on public land</h3>

<p>Where dead birds are on public land it is the local authority’s responsibility to safely dispose of the carcases as animal by-products. See our guidance on how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-dead-animal">report a dead or injured animal</a>.</p>

<h4>Disposal of dead wild birds found at domestic premises</h4>

<p>After contacting the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> Helpline (03459 33 55 77) to report the dead wild birds, if the birds are not required for surveillance purposes, follow the advice below for their disposal.</p>

<p>Disposal in household or municipal waste refuse:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if possible, wear disposable protective gloves when picking up and handling dead wild birds (if disposable gloves are not available, a plastic bag can be used as a make-shift glove). When the dead wild bird has been picked up, the bag can be turned back on itself and tied. It should then be placed in a second plastic bag, tied and disposed of in the normal household waste (lidded bin outside)</li>
  <li>place the dead wild bird in a suitable plastic bag, preferably leak proof. Care should be taken not to contaminate the outside of the bag</li>
  <li>tie the bag and place it in a second plastic bag</li>
  <li>remove gloves by turning them inside out and then place them in the second plastic bag. Tie the bag and dispose of it in the normal household refuse bin</li>
</ul>

<p>Burial:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the dead wild bird can be buried, but not in a plastic bag</li>
  <li>the depth of the burial hole must be sufficient to prevent animals scavenging and gaining access to it – at least 60cm deep is advised</li>
  <li>location must not be near any watercourses, or likely to contaminate local water supplies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bird fairs, markets, shows and other gatherings</h2>

<p>Bird gatherings include (but are not limited to) bird fairs, markets, shows, sales, exhibitions, vehicles used to transport live birds where the birds are brought together from multiple premises and some premises used for dealing or internet sales.</p>

<p>Bird gatherings are not permitted within a disease control zone. Outside of these areas bird gatherings are only permitted if licensed. Check if you are in a zone on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://defra.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8cb1883eda5547c6b91b5d5e6aeba90d" rel="external">interactive map</a>.</p>

<p>Each UK administration has made available bird gathering licences. These allow gatherings (including in the <abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr>)  as long as the following is met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they do not take place within a disease control zone</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> is notified at least 7 days before the event</li>
  <li>gatherings meet all the requirements of the relevant general licence</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Avian Influenza Prevention Zone">AIPZ</abbr> measures do not control bird gatherings. Changes to the control of bird gathering only happens by amending or revoking the general licences.</p>

<p>The general licences currently available do not permit gathering of poultry (Galliformes or Anseriformes birds). Galliforme birds include pheasants, partridge, quail, chickens, turkey and guinea fowl. Anseriforme birds include ducks, geese and swans. Bird gatherings of other types of birds are still permitted through the general licences.</p>

<p>Further information can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bird-gatherings-licences">guidance for bird gatherings</a>. The requirements are set out in the licences for the relevant UK administration.</p>

<p>A general licence permitting bird gatherings with the exception of poultry gatherings is also available in Northern Ireland. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/articles/avian-influenza-ai" rel="external">DAERA website</a> for further information,</p>

<h2>Trade, import and export issues</h2>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-importing-and-exporting-live-animals-or-animal-products">collection of guidance and forms for importing and exporting live animals or animal products</a> is available.</p>

<h3>World Animal Health Organisation (<abbr title="World Organisation for Animal Health">OIE</abbr>) disease freedom</h3>

<p>Following confirmation of H5N1 <abbr title="High pathogenicity avian influenza">HPAI</abbr> in a small poultry unit at a premises near Alcester, Bidford, Warwickshire, the UK is no longer free from avian influenza under the World Organisation for Animal Health (<abbr title="World Organisation for Animal Health">OIE</abbr>) rules. There are, therefore, some restrictions on exports of affected commodities to third countries. Trade in poultry and poultry related products with third countries that do not require whole UK avian influenza country freedom may continue on the basis of the conditions included in the export health certificates, unless otherwise notified by the importing country.</p>

<p>Agreed export health certificates between the UK and importing countries are considered and issued on a case-by-case basis and can be certified by an Official Veterinarian only if the consignment meets the requirements set out in the export health certificates in full.</p>

<h3>Exports to the EU</h3>

<p>Exports from Great Britain to the EU of live poultry or poultry products are not permitted from disease control zones.</p>

<p>There are no restrictions on exports to the EU from outside the disease control zones.</p>

<p>The European Commission is currently considering amending the regionalisation of the UK in Regulation (EU) 2021/404 in relation to these new <abbr title="High pathogenicity avian influenza">HPAI</abbr> outbreaks.</p>

<p>To avoid disruption to trade, the European Commission has requested that EU countries consider continuing to accept certified poultry and poultry products from the UK, if they originate outside the restricted areas.</p>

<h3>Imports from the EU</h3>

<p>You can’t import poultry and poultry products into the UK from within avian influenza disease control zones in EU countries.</p>

<p>EU trade relies on strict certification for movement of live poultry, day old chicks and hatching eggs. Products such as poultry meat, table eggs and poultry products are not subject to certification within the EU.</p>

<h2>Higher Risk Areas (<abbr title="Higher Risk Areas">HRAs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>All areas in Great Britain remain at risk of avian influenza in wild birds.</p>

<p>However, in Great Britain we’ve defined a number of areas as ‘Higher Risk Areas’ (<abbr title="Higher Risk Areas">HRAs</abbr>). These are generally areas near where wild birds (and in particular gulls and wild waterfowl) gather, such as lakes, marshes or estuaries. If you are planning a new poultry unit you should take into account where <abbr title="Higher Risk Area">HRA</abbr> are in relation to where the unit is planned.</p>

<p>We have defined <abbr title="Higher Risk Areas">HRAs</abbr> following our previous experience of avian influenza outbreaks, coupled with the latest scientific and veterinary opinion. This indicates that migratory wild waterfowl (ducks, geese and swans) and gulls pose a continual threat for the introduction of avian influenza into premises where poultry, game birds, pet and other captive birds are kept. We have published more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-bird-flu-in-europe">detail of the rationale and approach behind Higher Risk Areas</a>.</p>

<h2>Disease control strategy</h2>

<p>Cases of avian influenza, if they occur, are controlled by following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contingency-plan-for-exotic-notifiable-diseases-of-animals-in-england">contingency plan for exotic notifiable diseases</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notifiable-avian-disease-control-strategy-2015">notifiable avian disease control strategy</a>. You can read what happens <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notifiable-diseases-in-animals">when a notifiable disease is suspected or confirmed</a>.</p>

<p>Further disease control measures will be based on the latest scientific evidence and veterinary advice.</p>
