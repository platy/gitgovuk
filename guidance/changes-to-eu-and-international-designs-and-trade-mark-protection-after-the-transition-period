<p>This guidance explains the changes to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law as a result of the Withdrawal Agreement, that preserve existing design and international rights. It also covers other legislative changes required to effectively administer and implement the new rights.</p>

<p>Designs are a form of intellectual property. They protect the appearance of the whole or part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, its lines, contours, colour, shape, texture, materials and ornamentation.</p>

<p>A design can be protected if it is new and has individual character compared to designs that are already in the public domain.</p>

<p>Trade marks enable consumers and businesses to differentiate the goods and services of one trader from another. They commonly take the form of words, logos, or a combination of both.</p>

<p>Trade marks are registered rights, with protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> granted by the Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>), the European Union Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>), or via an international registration filed under the Madrid Protocol at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organisation">WIPO</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="what-will-change-after-the-end-of-the-transition-period">What will change after the end of the transition period</h2>

<p>At the end of the transition period (1 January 2021), registered Community designs (<abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>), unregistered Community designs (<abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr>), will no longer be valid in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>These rights will be immediately and automatically replaced by <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> rights. If you own an existing right, you do not need to do anything at this stage.</p>

<p>Design protection can currently be obtained via a registered right or an unregistered right in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a national registered design granted by the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a registered Community design granted by the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an international registration designating either the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, filed under the Hague Agreement at <abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organisation">WIPO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>unregistered protection can be obtained in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> through the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design right and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> unregistered Community design.</li>
</ul>

<p>On 1 January 2021, any existing <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>, <abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr>, European Union Trade Marks (<abbr title="European Union Trade Mark">EUTM</abbr>), and International (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) designs and trade marks will only cover the remaining <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states.</p>

<h2 id="registered-design">Registered design</h2>

<h3 id="creation-of-the-re-registered-design">Creation of the re-registered design</h3>

<p>All registered and published <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> will have comparable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> designs, which will be recorded on the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register. These will be treated as if they had been applied for and registered under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>The legislative changes introduced in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will ensure that the holder of an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is provided with an equivalent <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right. They will retain the registration and application dates recorded against the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and will inherit any priority dates.</p>

<p>As fully independent <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> rights, they may be challenged, assigned, licensed or renewed separately from the original <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Re-registered designs will be created at no cost to the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> holder, and we are ensuring that minimal administrative burden will be placed upon the right holder.</p>

<h3 id="pending-applications">Pending applications</h3>

<p>On 1 January 2021, there will be a small number of <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> applications that are still pending in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> system.</p>

<p>If you hold a pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application on 1 January 2021, you will be able to apply to register a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design in the 9 months after 1 January 2021 and retain the earlier filing date of the pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<p>To do so, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application must relate to the same design as that filed in the pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application.</p>

<p>If the details of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application do not match those of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application, then the earlier <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> date(s) will not be recognised.</p>

<p>Our digital and paper forms will be amended to include a new section for claiming the earlier filing date of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application.</p>

<p>These applications will be treated as a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design application. They will be examined under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law. In these circumstances, the standard <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> fee structure will apply.</p>

<h3 id="effect-of-priority-claims">Effect of priority claims</h3>

<p>A priority date claimed under the Paris Convention that has been recorded against the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> will be inherited by the re-registered design. The date of that priority claim will have effect where proceedings involve a re-registered design with a priority claim inherited from the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-legislation-related-to-uk-design-and-international-design-and-trade-mark-law">Changes to legislation related to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and international design and trade mark law</h2>

<h3 id="how-uk-design-and-international-design-and-trade-mark-law-currently-works">How <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and international design and trade mark law currently works</h3>

<p>The Withdrawal Agreement covers the above-mentioned aspects for <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>, there are other changes that must be made to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on designs for the effective administration and implementation of the comparable rights.  These are set out below.</p>

<p>The primary <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on registered designs is <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/88/contents" class="govuk-link">The Registered Designs Act 1949</a>. There is also secondary legislation, mainly contained within the Registered Design Rules 2006, together with amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<p><abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and <abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr> are defined by <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?%20uri=CELEX%3A32002R0006" class="govuk-link">Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) No 6/2002 on Community designs</a>. Registered and unregistered Community designs both have effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Community design regulation has been amended to apply the Hague System for the international registration of industrial designs to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Separately, the Registered Designs Act has been amended to apply the Hague System to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> as an individual country.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on trade marks is primarily contained in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/26/contents" class="govuk-link">Trade Marks Act 1994</a>. Secondary legislation appears in the Trade Marks Rules 2008 and other amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<p>Protected international trade marks registrations filed under the Madrid Protocol that designate the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (or both) also currently have effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="we-are-changing-uk-design-and-trade-mark-law">We are changing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and trade mark law</h3>

<p>On 1 January 2021, all existing <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>, <abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr>, EUTMs and international design and trade mark registrations designating the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will no longer provide protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>As a result, we must amend existing legislation to ensure that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> protection granted by these rights is preserved and allows <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law to continue to function effectively.</p>

<p>In addition, it will be necessary to remove or amend many of the existing references to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, European Economic Areas (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), and Member States that will become redundant or inappropriate.</p>

<h3 id="numbering-of-re-registered-design">Numbering of re-registered design</h3>

<p>The number allocated to the re-registered design will consist of the full <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> number prefixed with the digit â€˜9â€™.</p>

<p>This will provide users with a means of identifying re-registered rights created from <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and distinguishing them from existing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered designs.</p>

<p>The following examples demonstrate how re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> designs will be codified:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Existing RCD number</th>
      <th scope="col">Re-registered UK design number</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>004048098-0004</td>
      <td>90040480980004</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>000000021-0001</td>
      <td>90000000210001</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="opt-out">Opt out</h3>

<p>We are creating approximately 700,000 designs re-registered on 1 January 2021, we recognise that some <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> holders may not want to be granted such a right.</p>

<p>Holders of the new right will be allowed to â€˜opt outâ€™ of holding it. Opting out will mean that the re-registered design will be treated as if it had never been applied for or registered under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>You may not exercise an opt out right in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you have assigned, licensed or entered into an agreement in relation to the re-registered design if you have already launched proceedings based upon it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-request-an-opt-out">How to request an opt out</h3>

<p>To request an opt out, you must submit a short notice providing us with the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> number, along with details of any persons with an interest in the right. The new law requires that notice to interested third parties must be given for opt out to have effect.</p>

<p>Therefore, where needed, you must confirm that such action has been taken. Opt out requests should only be submitted after 1 January 2021. Any requests made before this day will not be valid.</p>

<p>We have created a notice template which you should use when requesting opt out.</p>

<p>The template will be available at GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on 1 January 2021, and we will provide a dedicated email address for sending it back to us. Once we have received a request, we will send you confirmation that the right has been removed from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register.</p>

<p>Opt out requests should only be submitted after 1 January 2021. Any requests made before this day will not be valid.</p>

<h3 id="renewals-and-restoration">Renewals and restoration</h3>

<p>Once re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design rights are created, a separate renewal fee will apply for each re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design. Both <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered designs and <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> can be renewed every 5 years up to a maximum of 25 years.</p>

<p>Once a re-registered design is created, a separate renewal fee will apply for both that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right and the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>. The fees will need to be paid separately to <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> and to <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of future renewal, the re-registered design will retain the existing renewal date of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Under existing law, we send a renewal reminder to any <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design owner whose right is due to expire, and we do so in advance of the expiry date. This practice will be retained for all re-registered designs with renewal dates which fall more than 6 months after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>However, where the re-registered design expires within the 6 month period that falls after 1 January 2021, we will adopt a new procedure.</p>

<p>We are also changing the law to accommodate <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> that have expired in the 6 months before 1 January 2021, and which are still in their late renewal period when we leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="designs-which-expire-after-1-january-2021">Designs which expire after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>The same procedure for renewal and late renewal of registered designs under the Registered Designs Act and the Registered Designs Rules will apply to re-registered designs.</p>

<p>You will be sent a reminder renewal notice on the actual day of expiry (or as soon as is practicable after that date). This notice will inform you that the re-registered design has expired, and that we will provide you with a further 6 month period, running from the date of the notice, in which the right may be renewed.</p>

<p>Where the re-registered design will expire within 6 months after 1 January 2021, the usual additional renewal fee will not be payable.</p>

<p>In addition to the new reminder notice being sent on or soon after the day of expiry, those with re-registered designs that expire within the fourth, fifth and sixth months after 1 January 2021 will also receive the conventional advance reminder notice in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Where the re-registered design is not renewed, it will be removed from the register. It may be restored at a later date in accordance with existing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>You should note that where an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>â€™s renewal date falls after 1 January 2021, early payment of the renewal fee at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>, on a date prior to 1 January 2021, will have no effect in respect of the re-registered design.</p>

<p>Any re-registered design with a renewal date falling at any time after 1 January 2021 will be subject to a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> renewal action and fee. This is regardless of whether a renewal action was taken on the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> before 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3 id="designs-which-expire-before-1-january-2021">Designs which expire before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>We will also create a re-registered design from any <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expired in the 6 months prior to 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>has not been subject to a late renewal action at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> by is still within its 6 month late renewal period on 1 January 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>These re-registered designs will hold an â€˜expiredâ€™ status. Their continued effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will be dependent upon late renewal of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is subject to late renewal, that renewal will also have effect on the expired re-registered design. This means that the re-registered design will be automatically renewed as a result of the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>â€™s late renewal.</p>

<p>In this scenario, you will not be required to pay any renewal fees in respect of your first (<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) renewal of the re-registered design.</p>

<p>If the expired <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is not late-renewed at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>, then the re-registered design (which was created on 1 January 2021 in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) will be removed from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register on expiry of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>â€™s late renewal period.</p>

<p>It will then be treated as if it had never been applied for or registered under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<h3 id="rcd-registrations-and-applications-reinstated-after-1-january-2021">
<abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> registrations and applications reinstated after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>Under the Community Design Regulation, a right that has been struck from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> register because of the applicant or ownerâ€™s failure to meet a deadline may be reinstated later and treated as if it had continuous legal effect.</p>

<p>Re-registered designs will only be created from <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> which are registered within 6 months of its renewal date prior to 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Therefore, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rights which are not registered on that date but which are subject to reinstatement will not automatically result in the grant of re-registered designs. To address this, the new law provides holders and applicants of reinstated <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rights with the means to preserve those rights in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> are reinstated after 1 January 2021, and the proprietor notifies us of such action, we will create a re-registered design. Reinstatement of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rights can only occur where application is made to the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> within one year of the missed deadline.</p>

<p>If you hold an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> which was reinstated after 1 January 2021, and you have not been granted a re-registered design, you should inform us within 6 months of the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>â€™s restoration by emailing <a href="mailto:information@ipo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">information@ipo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application which was reinstated after 1 January 2021 and it holds a filing date prior to 1 January 2021, you may submit a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design application claiming the earlier <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> filing and/or priority date.</p>

<p>You can do this within 9 months of the date on which the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application was restored.</p>

<h2 id="deferred-publication">Deferred publication</h2>

<h3 id="where-publication-of-the-rcd-is-deferred-at-euipo">Where publication of the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is deferred at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Under the new law, an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> that is deferred on exit day will be treated as being equivalent to a pending application. The publication of an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> may be deferred at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> for up to thirty months.</p>

<p>Where deferment is requested, <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> will not publish the design until either the holder has paid a publication fee and the deferment period has elapsed, or the holder requests publication before such expiry.</p>

<p>Whilst the deferment period is ongoing, <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> will only publish basic details about the right holder and the filing date.</p>

<p>The holder of a deferred <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> can preserve its earlier filing and priority dates in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by filing an equivalent registered design application within nine months after exit day.</p>

<p>The application will not be the subject of a substantive examination, because the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> has already been examined by <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-the-uk-registered-design-to-be-deferred">Applying for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design to be deferred</h3>

<p>There is currently no framework in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation creating the right to defer publication of a registered design. As a matter of practice, the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> permits applicants to defer publication of their design by up to 12 months.</p>

<p>The examples below explain when a design will be published where the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is subject to deferment at the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>, and a corresponding <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application is made which seeks to retain the earlier <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> dates and requests <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> deferment.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design applications, that do not seek to retain earlier filing and priority dates of a corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> that was deferred  on 1 January 2021, may request <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> deferment in the normal manner.</p>

<p>In such cases, a period of twelve monthsâ€™ deferment will run from the date on which the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application was filed. This is regardless of whether that date falls inside or outside of the nine months after 1 January 2021..</p>

<h3 id="how-uk-design-and-international-design-and-trade-mark-law-currently-works-1">How <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and international design and trade mark law currently works</h3>

<p>The primary <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on registered designs is <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/88/contents" class="govuk-link">The Registered Designs Act 1949</a>. There is also secondary legislation, mainly contained within the Registered Design Rules 2006, together with amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<p><abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and <abbr title="unregistered Community designs">UCDs</abbr> are defined by <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?%20uri=CELEX%3A32002R0006" class="govuk-link">Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) No 6/2002 on Community designs</a>. Registered and unregistered Community designs both have effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Community design regulation has been amended to apply the Hague System for the international registration of industrial designs to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Separately, the Registered Designs Act has been amended to apply the Hague System to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> as an individual country.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on trade marks is primarily contained in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/26/contents" class="govuk-link">Trade Marks Act 1994</a>. Secondary legislation appears in the Trade Marks Rules 2008 and other amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<p>Protected international trade marks registrations filed under the Madrid Protocol that designate the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (or both) also currently have effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="we-are-changing-uk-design-and-trade-mark-law-1">We are changing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and trade mark law</h3>

<p>After 1 January 2021, international design and trade mark registrations designating the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will no longer provide protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Information on the protection of these rights after 1 January 2021 is available:</p>
