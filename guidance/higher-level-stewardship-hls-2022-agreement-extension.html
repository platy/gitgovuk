<h2>Background</h2>
<p>A Higher Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>) extension is when the end date of an expiring <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement can be changed to a later date.</p>

<p>If your agreement has been extended in 2019, 2020 or 2021, the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) may offer to extend your agreement for a further year. It will be based on the criteria that was used in previous years and you must continue to meet these criteria. You should contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> to let us know of any changes to your circumstances.</p>

<p>If your agreement started in 2012 and is due to expire in 2022, Natural England (<abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr>) will assess if it is suitable to be extended using the criteria below. <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> will, where appropriate, recommend that <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> offer an extension to the agreement for a year.</p>

<p>Every year after that, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will consider whether to offer extensions to all holders of expiring agreements, depending on value for money.</p>

<h2>Why <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extensions are being proposed for 2022</h2>
<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> are offering <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement extensions to deliver the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it will provide a simple way to maintain the environmental outcomes that the public has invested in over the last 10 years, where those outcomes meet the scheme expectations</li>
  <li>it will secure ongoing payments for farmers who are eligible for extensions that will deliver value for money</li>
  <li>it will be simpler to administer and is a useful short term measure in anticipation of the new Defra environmental land management schemes.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have worked with Defra and <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> to allow suitable <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreements to be extended, if they meet the criteria below.</p>

<h2>Principles of <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extensions</h2>
<p><abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement extensions can be offered where the current agreement already delivers the environmental outcomes expected and meets the requirements set out below.</p>

<p>If your agreement has a 2012 start date and it expires in 2022, <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> will assess it based on environmental outcomes using the criteria below.</p>

<p>If you are not offered an extension for your agreement, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will let you know in time for you to apply for a new agreement through Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>). Read about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/countryside-stewardship-get-paid-for-environmental-land-management">Countryside Stewardship agreements</a> you may apply for instead. You will need to apply using the standard eligibilities and priorities in place at that time.</p>

<p>If your agreement has already been extended in previous years, the criteria below will still apply.</p>

<h2>Eligibility and regulation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement must not have expired or been terminated on or before the date the extension is accepted by you and received by us</li>
  <li>You must want the agreement to be extended and agree to comply with the continuing rules</li>
  <li>There must not be a need for any further capital works to secure the effective delivery of the options under your agreement, during the extension period</li>
  <li>There must be no outstanding land transfers which cannot be completed before the date of extension - in this situation, as an agreement holder, you must make sure all necessary paperwork is complete before the agreement can be extended (including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers"><abbr title="Rural Land and Entitlements">RLE1s</abbr></a>)</li>
  <li>There must be no outstanding breaches related to the agreement that cannot be put right before the date of extension - in this situation, as an agreement holder, you must make sure you have responded to all requests for information from us and <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> relating to the breach, and have taken any required action to put right the issues found</li>
  <li>There are no unmanaged areas of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>) or Scheduled Monuments (<abbr title="Scheduled Monument">SM</abbr>) on your holding that need to be brought under management</li>
  <li>There must be no other non-compliances with the scheme rules</li>
</ul>

<h2>Environmental outcomes</h2>
<p>Assessments of environmental benefits are based solely on the options in your current agreement.
The <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> adviser will complete a technical assessment to check the following before making a recommendation to offer an extension:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the options in your current <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement remain appropriate for the Environmental Stewardship (<abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr>) priority target features on the holding</li>
  <li>at least 80% of the Priority Habitats (<abbr title="Priority Habitats">PH</abbr>) on your holding (if applicable) are under appropriate, beneficial options</li>
  <li>the management prescriptions are being delivered at the point of assessment as set out in your <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement and these options are capable of achieving the required outcomes, as set out in the indicators of success</li>
  <li>where <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is included in the agreement, the current land management is still appropriate for the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> features and <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> can give consent without amending the option choices or prescription details and without the need for additional capital works</li>
</ul>

<p>If your agreement has less than 80% of the <abbr title="Priority Habitats">PH</abbr> on the holding under option management in your agreement, it is unlikely you will be offered an extension. The expectation is that you should apply for <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Mid Tier or Higher Tier to bring the unmanaged <abbr title="Priority Habitats">PH</abbr> into suitable options.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will only consider an extension for these agreements if there are genuine practical or administrative barriers which would prevent the additional habitat from being managed under a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement. Extension will not be available on holdings with unmanaged <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> or <abbr title="Scheduled Monument">SM</abbr> that need to be under scheme options. In that situation you can apply for a Countryside Stewardship agreement.</p>

<h2>Additional rules and conditions</h2>
<p>The following rules and conditions will also apply to <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you cannot use an extension offer to add, remove, or replace options in the current agreement</li>
  <li>permissive access options HN1-HN7 will be removed from the agreement before making the extension offer</li>
  <li>educational access items will be retained</li>
  <li>any incomplete capital works will be removed from the agreement</li>
  <li>extension is only available for <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> only, <abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr>/<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>, <abbr title="Organic Entry Level Stewardship">OELS</abbr>/<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> and <abbr title="Uplands Entry Level Stewardship">UELS</abbr>/<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreements</li>
  <li>extension is not available on any agreement that has no <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> options remaining after any required amendments have been made to remove options that are no longer available, for example, removal of permissive access or woodland options, as described above</li>
  <li>if you have an agreement that has UB17 Stone Walling Restoration you will receive an <abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr> base map with the revised extension agreement documents - as the agreement holder, you must mark up the stone walling (maximum 40 metres annually) you will be restoring for this extension period on the map</li>
  <li>you will need to confirm you have management control for the extension period - this means you will need to supply a new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-stewardship-supplementary-land-ownership-and-control">supplementary land ownership and control form</a>, countersigned by your landlord, with your acceptance declaration if there are any changes to management control under the landlord’s consent for the 2021 agreement year, or if your current arrangements will expire during the extension period</li>
  <li>you will need to supply a new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-stewardship-shared-grazing-and-common-land">Shared grazing and common land form</a> with your declaration if there are any changes to the commons supplementary arrangements for the 2021 agreement year, or if your current arrangements will expire during the extension period - this includes the associated consultation with all commons rights holders</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not provide new documents to support your extended agreement, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will continue to use the most recent documents you submitted as part of your <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr> boundary restoration options</h2>
<p>If you have any of the following options in your agreement, you will receive an <abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr> base map with your revised extension agreement documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UB14/OB14/EB14/UOB14: Hedgerow restoration</li>
  <li>UB15: Stone-faced hedgebank restoration</li>
  <li>UB16: Earth bank restoration</li>
  <li>UB17/UOB17: Stone wall restoration</li>
</ul>

<p>You must mark up the length of boundary (maximum 40 metres annually) you will be restoring for this extension period on the map. You must retain the map for your records, as you may be asked to present it at inspection. 
You cannot include lengths of boundary previously restored under the agreement. If you do not have any additional lengths of boundary to be restored, contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>How woodland will be affected by <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extensions</h2>
<p>If you have woodland options HC7 and/or HC8 in your current agreement with a combined area greater than 3ha, these options will be removed from your extended agreement. The woodland parcels will remain in your extended agreement without <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> payments (<abbr title="Entry Level Stewardship">ELS</abbr> payments will continue if applicable). If the HC7/HC8 individual land parcels are larger than 0.5ha, but together are 3ha or less, then the HC7/HC8 can remain in the agreement.</p>

<p>However, if you wish to secure funding for ongoing management of these woodland parcels where HC7/HC8 have been removed from the agreement, you will need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To apply for <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Woodland Higher Tier you need a Forestry Commission (<abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr>) approved woodland management plan (<abbr title="Woodland Management Plan">WMP</abbr>). You can apply for <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> funding to prepare the plan through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-management-plan-grant-countryside-stewardship">Woodland Management Planning Grant</a>.</li>
  <li>Request the removal of those parcels from your extended <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement by contacting <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> after <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr> have approved your <abbr title="Woodland Management Plan">WMP</abbr>, or given approval in principle.</li>
  <li>Apply for a standalone Higher Tier Woodland Only agreement. If you do not already have a plan approved by <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr>, you should make your application in 2023 rather than 2022. This is because you need to allow for the time it takes to write a woodland management plan and get it approved (allow at least 7 weeks for <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr> to approve it).</li>
</ol>

<p>Submit your draft plan no later than 31 December to allow enough time to get it approved and make a Higher Tier application. You should also allow for time to apply and receive any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-management-plan-grant-countryside-stewardship">Woodland Management Planning Grant</a> agreement if you are applying for funding.</p>

<p>Woodland creation options HC9 and HC10 will be extended.</p>

<h2>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>)</h2>
<p>If you are offered an <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extension and you have a Site of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>) on your land, you may need a new consent for the ongoing management activities on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>. You will need to contact <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> to get consent as soon as you receive the agreement extension documents from <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>. Instructions on how to do this will be provided in the extension documents you receive from <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> cannot extend your agreement without the appropriate consent from <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr>, where this is required.</p>

<h2>Educational access</h2>
<p>Educational access options will be extended. You will need to continue to record and submit a record of these visits, as currently required under the terms of your agreement.</p>

<h2>Greening and Ecological Focus Areas (<abbr title="Ecological Focus Areas">EFAs</abbr>)</h2>
<p>Greening requirements have been removed from the Basic Payments Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>) for 2022. This means that you do not need to consider the overlap of <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> options with <abbr title="Ecological Focus Areas">EFAs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>What will happen next</h2>
<p><abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> will carry out an initial assessment to see if your agreement may be suitable for extension. If it is, a <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> adviser will contact you to determine whether your agreement still meets the rules and continues to provide the environmental outcomes it was set up to deliver.</p>

<p>The adviser may arrange a site visit to confirm your agreement is suitable. A site visit may not be necessary if <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> already has sufficient knowledge of your agreement. If your agreement includes <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land, a visit must be completed.</p>

<p>If you do not want to proceed with an extension, you can inform the adviser. You may apply for any of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/countryside-stewardship-get-paid-for-environmental-land-management">Countryside Stewardship agreements</a> instead.</p>

<p>If your current agreement meets the criteria, the <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> adviser will recommend that <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> offer an extension to your agreement for one year. We expect <abbr title="Natural England">NE</abbr> to complete assessments and make recommendations by December 2021.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will decide whether to extend your agreement and if suitable, will prepare an amended version of your agreement. To extend your agreement, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will remove any incomplete capital works and any options ineligible for extension. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send you an extension offer with amended agreement documents, and a declaration for you to sign if you want to accept the extension.</p>

<p>You will need to sign and return the declaration with any relevant supporting documents so that <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> receive them by the date shown on the covering letter (usually 20 working days). We must receive the declaration by post – we can’t accept emailed declarations.</p>

<p>If your agreement started in 2009, 2010 or 2011 and has been extended once or more, provided you continue to meet the criteria, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send you updated documents to offer you an extension to your agreement for a further year. You should contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> if there have been any changes to your circumstances. Also, consider whether any changes to your circumstances affect any consents you currently have, for example, <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> consent.</p>

<p>You will need to sign and return the declaration and <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> must receive it by the date shown on the covering letter (usually 20 working days). We must receive the declaration by post – we can’t accept emailed declarations.</p>

<p>Also, include with the signed declaration any other consents and documents if required, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> consent</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-stewardship-shared-grazing-and-common-land">shared grazing and common land form</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-stewardship-supplementary-land-ownership-and-control">supplementary land ownership and control form</a></li>
