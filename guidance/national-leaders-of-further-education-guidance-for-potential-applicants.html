<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<ul>
  <li>be a serving finance director of a general or specialist further education college or sixth-form college in England with a rating of good or outstanding for both quality and financial health</li>
  <li>have been a tier 2 finance director for approximately 3 years or more at the point of application (reporting directly to the CEO or principal)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your college must not be in intervention.</p>

<h2>Assessment process</h2>

<p>Your application will be assessed including a review of your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>skills and professional qualifications</li>
  <li>expertise</li>
  <li>track record</li>
  <li>Ofsted inspection reports</li>
  <li>data that Department for Education (DfE) and&nbsp;the Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>)&nbsp;hold on institutions in which you have served</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be an initial paper-based sift. Short-listed candidates will be invited to an interview and scenario-based exercise.</p>

<p>We will consider factors relevant to the objectives of the&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr>&nbsp;programme in making a decision. For example, geographical distribution and a range of experience across all&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFEs</abbr>&nbsp;to best match the improvement needs of colleges.</p>

<h2>Apply</h2>

<p>To apply to become an <abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> finance specialist:</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Applications close at 23:59 on 18 September 2022. You’ll be invited to attend an induction meeting in London on 11 October if your application is successful.</p>

<h2>About national leaders of further education</h2>

<p><abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> provide mentoring and support to colleges as part of the active support outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-oversight-support-and-intervention">College oversight: support and intervention</a> guidance.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr>&nbsp;programme aims to engage and mobilise outstanding leaders within the further education sector to work with their peers in supporting improvement, to secure the best possible outcomes for learners at all colleges.</p>

<p>Participation in the&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr>&nbsp;programme offers principles and finance directors the opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop additional skills through leading improvement projects</li>
  <li>work with other&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFEs</abbr>&nbsp;as part of an active improvement network</li>
  <li>transfer learning and experience from both, back to their home college</li>
</ul>

<p>Designation as an&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr>&nbsp; helps colleges to attract good quality staff and build strong relationships with employers.</p>

<h2>The role of an&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> finance specialist</h2>

<p><abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFEs</abbr>&nbsp;determine how they deliver support and tailor their work to fit the needs of the college they are supporting. If appropriate, this could include involving other members of the&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr>’s college staff (for example management information systems, human resources or estates) to provide support. An&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> finance specialist&nbsp;might, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work with the finance director, and leadership team of the supported college to identify financial improvement needs, and potential sources of support</li>
  <li>work alongside key members of the finance team on the delivery of specific financial improvement programmes</li>
</ul>

<p>The department will match&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> finance specialists&nbsp;to colleges that have requested financial support or where a need has been identified by the&nbsp;<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>&nbsp;Commissioner. This includes contributing to the department’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/help-and-support-for-colleges">Curriculum Efficiency and Financial Sustainability Support (CEFFS) programme</a></p>

<p><abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> finance specialists&nbsp;may work to support improvement within their own region, or with a college in a neighbouring region, where issues around competition between the relevant institutions are less likely to arise.</p>

<p>Each year, an&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> finance specialist&nbsp;will be expected to commit approximately 10 days to their role. The time commitment involved in delivery of a deployment will vary according to the nature of the improvement activities involved.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>Funding for work as an&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr>&nbsp;comes from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an annual bursary</li>
  <li>the supported college</li>
</ul>

<h3>An annual bursary</h3>

<p>DfE provides the <abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr>’s home institution with an annual bursary that can be used to cover costs associated with the <abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> finance specialist role. The value of the bursary is £15K per annum. The costs covered through the bursary can include, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travel for meetings, <abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> training and network events</li>
  <li>travel to an initial meeting with a college to discuss a potential need</li>
  <li>the cost of staff cover in relation to those activities</li>
  <li>professional development for the <abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr>’s college team which is related to the <abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> role</li>
  <li>other non-recoverable costs incurred as part of the <abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> role</li>
</ul>

<h3>The supported college</h3>

<p>Supported colleges may choose to pay directly for any costs that are not covered by the <abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> finance specialist annual bursary.</p>

<h2>Training and development</h2>

<p>As a new&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> finance specialist, you’ll be invited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend an induction workshop</li>
  <li>meetings twice a year</li>
  <li>network with other&nbsp;<abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFEs</abbr> and members of the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> commissioner’s team&nbsp;where you can share experience and good practice in delivering improvement support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>You&nbsp;will be required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>submit quarterly reports on the improvement support that you have provided and its impact</li>
  <li>report on bursary spending at the end of each financial year</li>
</ul>

<p>If you fail to provide the minimum level of support in any given academic year, your status will be reviewed, and some or all the bursary funding paid for that period may be repayable.</p>

<h2>Appointment</h2>

<p>You’ll be appointed for up to 3 years. At the end of your period of appointment, you may be able to apply for re-appointment.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about the <abbr title="national leaders of further education">NLFE</abbr> programme, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FE.Commissioner@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>.Commissioner@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
