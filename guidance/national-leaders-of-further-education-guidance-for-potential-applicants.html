<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>National Leaders of Further Education (<abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr>) are one of the tools available to colleges as part of the active support outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-oversight-support-and-intervention">College oversight: support and intervention</a> guidance.</p>

<p>National Leaders of Further Education (<abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr>) are serving college leaders who have a strong track record of delivering improvement – both at their own colleges and in working with others. They provide mentoring and improvement support to other colleges.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> programme aims is to engage and mobilise outstanding leaders within the further education sector to work with their peers in supporting improvement, to secure the best possible outcomes for learners at all colleges. <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> are supported in their role by their senior leadership teams and members of staff in their own colleges.</p>

<p>Participation in the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> programme offers principals and colleges the opportunity to develop the skills of senior staff through leading improvement projects, to work with other <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> as part of an active improvement network, and to transfer learning and experience from both back to their home college.  Designation as a <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> is prestigious, helping colleges to attract good quality staff, and to build strong relationships with employers.</p>

<h2>The role of an <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> have significant autonomy in determining how they deliver support and tailor their work to fit the needs of the college(s) they are supporting. This could include involving other members of the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr>’s college staff to provide support. A <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> might, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work with the principal and leadership team of the supported college to identify improvement needs, and potential sources of support</li>
  <li>provide strategic mentoring to the college leadership; or</li>
  <li>work alongside key members of the leadership team on the delivery of specific improvement programmes</li>
</ul>

<p>The department will match <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> to colleges that have requested support or where a need has been identified by the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> Commissioner.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> may work to support improvement within their own region, or with a college in a neighbouring region, where issues around competition between the relevant institutions are less likely to arise.</p>

<p>Where a <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> is engaged on the delivery of a major improvement project, the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> diagnoses and reviews improvement needs, and works with the leadership of the college to draw up an appropriate improvement plan, identifying suitable sources of support – including, where applicable, the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> and their own college. The <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> negotiates the arrangements under which their support is provided to the supported college, <a class="govuk-link" href="#funding">refer to the funding section</a>.</p>

<p>Each year, a <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> (including their team) is expected to commit a minimum of 10 days to their role, and to undertake at least one major improvement project partnering with another college. The time commitment involved in delivery of a major project varies significantly according to the nature of the improvement activities involved, and the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr>’s role.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>Funding for work as an <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> comes from 2 sources:</p>

<h3>An annual bursary</h3>

<p>DfE provides the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr>’s home institution with an annual bursary that can be used to cover costs associated with the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> role. The value of the bursary is £10K per annum. The costs covered through the bursary can include, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travel for meetings, <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> training and network events</li>
  <li>travel to an initial meeting with a college to discuss a potential need</li>
  <li>the cost of staff cover in relation to those activities</li>
  <li>professional development for the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr>’s college team which is related to the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> role; and</li>
  <li>other non-recoverable costs incurre as part of the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> role</li>
</ul>

<h3>The supported college</h3>

<p>For major projects, and other support activity where the costs incurred by the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> exceed the amount provided for in the annual bursary, the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr>’s costs need to be recovered from the supported college.</p>

<h2>Training and development</h2>

<p>All new <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> attend an induction workshop and will be invited to meetings twice a year. They are also invited to join a network with other <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> where they can share experience and good practice in delivering improvement support.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p><abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> will be required to submit quarterly reports on the improvement support that they have provided and its impact. They will also be required to report on bursary spending at the end of each financial year.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> fails to provide the minimum level of support in any given academic year, his or her status will be reviewed, and some or all the bursary funding paid for that period may be repayable.</p>

<h2>Appointment</h2>

<p><abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> are appointed for up to 3 years. At the end of their period of appointment, they may be able to apply for re-appointment.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>To apply you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a serving CEO Principal of a general or specialist further education college or sixth-form college in England</li>
  <li>have been a substantive CEO Principal for approximately 5 years or more (at point of application), in which time you have been legally responsible for the management of a college and accountable to the governing body
    <ul>
      <li>either be named as CEO Principal in the most recent Ofsted inspection report for your current college where ‘overall effectiveness’, ‘leadership and management’ and ‘teaching, learning and assessment’ have been judged as at least ‘good’</li>
      <li>or be named in the most recent Ofsted inspection for your previous college with the same grading (where the most recent Ofsted inspection for your current college pre-dates the point at which you became CEO Principal, or where your current college is treated by Ofsted as a new provider and does not yet have an Ofsted inspection grade)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your current college must not be in intervention.</p>

<h2>Assessment process</h2>

<p>Your application will be rigorously assessed including a review of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your skills</li>
  <li>your expertise</li>
  <li>your track record</li>
  <li>your Ofsted inspection reports</li>
  <li>data that DfE and <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> hold on institutions in which you have served</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be an initial paper-based sift. Short-listed candidates will be invited to an interview and scenario-based exercise.</p>

<p>We will consider factors relevant to the objectives of the <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFE</abbr> programme in making a decision. For example, geographical distribution and a range of experience across all <abbr title="National Leaders of Further Education">NLFEs</abbr> to best match the improvement needs of colleges.</p>
