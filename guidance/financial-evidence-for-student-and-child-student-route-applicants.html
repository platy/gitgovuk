<h2>Overview of financial requirement</h2>

<p>The financial requirement is that you show you have enough money to support yourself while studying in the UK. Usually you’ll need to show a set amount of money for each month of your course, for up to 9 months.</p>

<p>If you’re applying from overseas, or if are applying in the UK but have not been here with permission for 12 months or more, you must show that you have enough money to cover your course fees (and boarding fees, if relevant) and living costs.</p>

<p>You might not need to provide financial evidence if you’re from an <a class="govuk-link" href="#exempt-countries">exempt country</a> but you should still make sure you have enough funds. UK Visas and Immigration may ask you to show that you have them.</p>

<p>You do not need to show funds if you are applying as a Student Union Sabbatical Officer or to study as a doctor or dentist in training.</p>

<h2>How your finance requirement is worked out</h2>

<h3>Students</h3>

<p>The amount of money you need to show depends on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your course fees, which are set out on your confirmation of acceptance for studies (<abbr title="confirmation of acceptance for studies">CAS</abbr>) Your education provider will send you the <abbr title="confirmation of acceptance for studies">CAS</abbr> once they’ve offered you a place on a course</li>
  <li>the length of your course</li>
  <li>whether you have already paid some money to your sponsor</li>
  <li>your course of study or type of student permission you are applying for</li>
  <li>where you are studying – the amount is different if you’re studying in London</li>
  <li>if you have paid any money to your sponsor for accommodation; up to £1,334 can be deducted from the funds you need to show</li>
  <li>your living arrangements, if you are aged under 18</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa">If you are allowed to bring dependants</a> (your partner or children) you will also need to show you have enough money to cover their living costs.</p>

<h3>Child Students</h3>

<p>The amount of money you need to show depends on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your course fees</li>
  <li>your boarding fees if you are boarding at the institution</li>
  <li>the length of your course</li>
  <li>who you are living with and where you are living</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have children under the age of 18 who you are financially responsible for and who live with you, you are not permitted to bring them with you on the Child Student route.</p>

<h2>Types of funds you can rely on</h2>

<p>You can show you have enough money using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an official financial or government sponsorship or grant</li>
  <li>a student loan from a government, government sponsored loan company, or a regulated student loans scheme</li>
  <li>your own money</li>
  <li>your parent’s money (if they provide a letter confirming they agree to you using it this way)</li>
  <li>your partner’s money  if your partner is present in the UK or applying at the same time</li>
</ul>

<h2>What evidence is not accepted</h2>

<p>The following are not accepted as evidence to show you have the required amount of money:</p>

<ul>
  <li>overdrafts</li>
  <li>bitcoin savings</li>
  <li>stocks and shares</li>
  <li>pensions</li>
  <li>bank accounts that are not regulated by the financial regulatory body in the country in which the bank operates</li>
  <li>bank accounts that don’t use electronic record keeping</li>
</ul>

<h2>Control of the funds</h2>

<p>You, or the account holder (such as your parents or partner), must have control of the funds you are relying on.</p>

<p>You must show  the funds have been held for 28 days, unless you are relying on a student loan or official financial sponsorship.</p>

<p>The bank statement(s) or evidence you use to show funds have been held for 28 days must be from the 31 days before you submit your application. The 28 days is calculated by counting back from the date of the closing balance on the most recent financial evidence.</p>

<h2>Evidence you need to provide</h2>

<h3>If you have official sponsorship</h3>

<p>To prove you have official financial sponsorship you need to show your reference number for confirmation of acceptance for studies (<abbr title="confirmation of acceptance for studies">CAS</abbr>).</p>

<p>If your official financial sponsorship is not recorded on your <abbr title="confirmation of acceptance for studies">CAS</abbr> you’ll need to show a letter of confirmation from the official financial sponsor. If you are not sure ask your sponsor. The letter must show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date</li>
  <li>the name of the financial sponsor</li>
  <li>contact details of the financial sponsor</li>
  <li>how long the sponsorship will last</li>
  <li>the amount of money that is being given or confirmation that all of your fees and living costs will be covered</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you have a student loan</h3>

<p>For student loans you need to show a student loan letter which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is dated no more than 6 months before the date of application</li>
  <li>confirms the loan is a student loan provided by either the relevant government or a government sponsored student loan company or an academic or educational loans scheme</li>
  <li>confirms there are no conditions on release of the loan funds other than a successful application to study</li>
  <li>confirms the amount of the loan</li>
  <li>confirms the loan is for you</li>
  <li>is on official stationery</li>
  <li>confirms the funds will be available to you, or paid directly to the sponsor, before you begin your course</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re using your own money</h3>

<p>If you’re not being financially sponsored or relying on a student loan, your funds can be held in any form of personal or building society account including a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>current account</li>
  <li>deposit account</li>
  <li>savings account</li>
  <li>pension savings</li>
  <li>investment account</li>
</ul>

<p>Cash must be in an account that allows you immediate access.</p>

<p>Funds must have been acquired legally and if you were in the UK you must not have earned them when working illegally.</p>

<p>If you’re using your own money, or that of a parent or partner you’ll need to show you have the required amount of money in an account. You can provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bank statements</li>
  <li>building society passbooks</li>
  <li>certificates of deposit</li>
  <li>a letter from your bank or building society</li>
</ul>

<p>Your bank statement should show information like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date it was issued</li>
  <li>your name (or the account holders name if it is your parent or partner)</li>
  <li>the name of the bank or building society</li>
  <li>balance on the account</li>
</ul>

<p>You can provide a download of electronic bank statements as long as it has this information.  You do not need to have these stamped by the bank.</p>

<p>We may do verification checks with your bank. If we’re unable to verify the funds your application may be refused.</p>

<h3>Money in other currencies</h3>

<p>If your money is held in a foreign currency this will be converted into pound sterling (£) using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/" rel="external">spot exchange rate on OANDA</a> for the date of the application.</p>

<h2>The amount of money you have to show</h2>

<h3>Students</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="confirmation of acceptance for studies">CAS</abbr> will show your course fees.</p>
