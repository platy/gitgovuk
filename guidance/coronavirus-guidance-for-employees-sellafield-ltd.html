<h2>Living with COVID-19 at Sellafield Ltd</h2>

<p>The UK Government has removed remaining domestic COVID-19 restrictions and has set out its “Living with Covid” plan.</p>

<p>As we learn to live with COVID-19, we are encouraging people to keep following simple steps to help keep themselves and others safe.</p>

<p>The pandemic is not over and how the virus will evolve over time remains uncertain. This guidance for employees marks a key step in our journey to living with COVID-19 as part of our ongoing ‘business as usual’ and replaces the enterprise risk assessment (ERA) which has served us well over the past 2 years.</p>

<p>The guidance aligns to government and UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) guidance in place from 01 April 2022, which replaced the legal provisions relating to COVID-19, including reporting under RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013).</p>

<p>This guidance reflects the government’s position for England, but the rules remain different elsewhere in the UK</p>

<p>Scotland: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/test-and-protect/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-infection" rel="external">Self-isolation guidance.</a></p>

<p>Wales: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/self-isolation" rel="external">Self-isolation guidance.</a></p>

<p>All employees should follow the legal requirements in the country they are in. If these requirements cause concerns or problems to your ability to undertake your role, please discuss these with your line manager.</p>

<h2>General control measures for COVID-19 in the workplace</h2>

<p>This includes operations, construction sites/shared workstations and equipment, all occupied buildings including change rooms, plant offices, control rooms, and lifts to protect against the risks of mixing with other people, infecting vulnerable groups and promoting spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>

<h3>General guidance</h3>

<p>Government information: COVID-19 response: Living with COVID-19</p>

<p><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1067725/COVID-19_Response_-_Living_with_COVID-19.pdf">COVID-19 response: Living with COVID-19 </a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">1.99 MB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">63 pages</span>)</span></p>

<p>In line with agile working principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for communal and shared areas maintain increased hand sanitisation and wipe in/wipe out regimes</li>
  <li>employees should carry out good personal hygiene and wash hands regularly. Hand wash facilities or sanitisers are available in Sellafield Ltd offices.</li>
  <li>shared PPE such as hard hats should be wiped-in and wiped-out (see section below).</li>
  <li>Pre-covid arrangements in our changerooms will take effect from 01 May 2022.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Sellafield Ltd premises and in line with government guidance it’s recommended to wear face coverings in crowded/enclosed spaces especially when infection rates are high or meeting people you don’t usually meet.</p>

<h3>Test availability</h3>

<p>Most people in England now don’t get free PCR or lateral flow tests (LFTs). A few groups remain entitled to free tests, including frontline NHS staff.</p>

<p>Some free testing for the public will continue in Scotland until the end of April 2022 and in Wales until the end of June 2022.</p>

<p>The over 75s and over 12s with weakened immune systems are still able to get free LFTs. Most people with symptoms won’t be entitled to free PCR tests or LFTs.</p>

<p>At Sellafield we have now ceased operating the on-site PCR test and trace facility and free LFTs are no longer available for collection for employees from Sellafield Ltd premises.</p>

<h3>Guidance for the severely immuno-suppressed and during pregnancy</h3>

<p>There’s specific guidance for people whose immune system means that they are at higher risk, because they have a reduced ability to fight infections, such as COVID-19.</p>

<p>Those employees who are severely immuno-suppressed are advised to diligently follow the government-advised controls and maintain full vaccination unless a doctor advises otherwise.</p>

<p>People who are eligible for community covid drug treatments because they’re at higher risk if they catch covid will be sent LFTs via the NHS to keep at home in case they develop symptoms.</p>

<p>Line management should consider extra precautions through use of the Reasonable Adjustments Passport for severely immuno-suppressed people.</p>

<p>For further information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/advice-for-people-at-high-risk/" rel="external">NHS guidelines.</a> This source also includes guidance for what to do regarding COVID-19 during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Previous guidance for pregnancy has been withdrawn, and in most cases, the same guidance applies as to everybody else. However, there are some circumstances where further precautions are recommended in the linked guidance.</p>

<h3>Self-isolation</h3>

<p>The law which required people with COVID-19 to self-isolate has been lifted. Routine contact tracing has ended, as have self-isolation support payments.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19">Guidance</a> has been issued by the government for people with symptoms of a respiratory infection including COVID-19, or a positive test result for COVID-19.</p>

<p>The government recommends that if you do test positive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you should try to stay at home for 5 days after the day the test was taken, and avoid contact with others - especially the vulnerable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work from home if you can, although the legal obligation to tell your employer you have COVID-19 has also ended</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children and young people 18 years and under should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for 3 days after testing positive where practicable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inform your healthcare provider of your positive test result before attending routine medical or dental appointments in person</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you may wish to ask friends or family to deliver groceries and other essentials</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the guidance says if you do have to go out, you should wear a well-fitting face covering made with multiple layers or a surgical face mask and stay 2 metres (6 foot) away from anyone outside your household</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, to further reduce the chance of passing COVID-19 on to others, if you end your self-isolation period before 10 full days you are strongly advised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to limit close contact with other people outside your household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to work from home if you can; particularly if you still feel unwell</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to wear a face covering where you are in close contact with other people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to limit contact with anyone who is at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Overseas travel</h3>

<p>Those traveling to and back from overseas for work or domestic reasons are to follow testing and self- isolation rules that are in force at the time of travel.</p>

<p>These rules vary from time to time, often at short notice and can be found on the government website.</p>

<h3>Applicability of this guidance</h3>

<p>This guidance can be used to help individual facilities plan their operations. If the guidance is not applicable, or needs to be adapted, then specific arrangements should be produced, and local TU/Safety Reps consulted. (Note: if local TU/Safety Reps are not available please contact the Full Time Safety Reps).</p>

<p>Contractors may develop and maintain project specific guidance for COVID-19, referencing this document and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reducing-the-spread-of-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19-in-the-workplace">HMG Workplace Health Guidance.</a></p>

<h3>Communal and shared areas, canteens, tea bars, offices, workshops etc including “touch- points” and shared equipment</h3>

<p>This is to protect against risks associated with contact with surfaces and shared equipment, large communal gatherings and transfer through shared crockery and interaction with catering staff.</p>

<h3>Guidance</h3>

<p>Enhanced cleaning has been implemented covering shared areas and high frequency touch points. Citrox Protect has been applied in the following buildings: 314, 370, 409, 282, 570, 371, 151, 111, Albion Square.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>individuals should wipe-in and wipe-out of workplaces and shared work equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wash or sanitize hands frequently</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider wearing a face covering</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Medical facilities (main medical/surgeries)</h3>

<p>This is to protect against COVID-19 transmission and losing critical medical personnel.</p>

<h3>Guidance</h3>

<p>In addition to communal and shared areas, canteens, tea bars, offices, workshops etc including “touch- points” and shared equipment section:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enhanced cleaning</li>
  <li>medical personnel are wearing PPE in line with NHS guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow occupational health house rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>face coverings are recommended to be worn when accessing and moving about main medical and surgeries</li>
  <li>face coverings are generally required for clinical interactions subject to individual clinical decisions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ventilation</h3>

<p>This is to protect against risks associated with recirculating ventilation systems and rooms with limited air movement may increase the chance of transmission.</p>

<p>In rooms/spaces with recirculating ventilation systems and rooms with limited air movement the risk is considered very low, and assessment has been carried out by Ventilation Technical Support Group in line with the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers guidance regarding recirculating ventilation supply systems and their highly unlikely potential contribution to the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Guidance</h3>

<p>Ventilation systems should be switched to “once-through” fresh air supply where practical.</p>

<p>Recirculation effect from local air conditioning units should also be considered but balanced against the need for cooling of equipment key to nuclear safety and maintaining reasonable workplace temperatures.</p>

<p>Where possible, whilst maintaining reasonable workplace temperatures, open windows and doors to increase ventilation as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open windows and doors for short, sharp bursts of 10 to 15 minutes regularly throughout the day</li>
  <li>leave windows open a small amount continuously and limit room occupancy</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sickness absence arrangements</h3>

<p>Where employees are too ill to work, they should now follow the standard terms and conditions process for sickness absence.</p>

<p>The automatic arrangements previously in place for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>application of special leave for self-isolation (can’t work from home), and</li>
  <li>exclusion of COVID-19 absences from the trigger level absence review process</li>
</ul>

<p>These have now moved to a position where these arrangements may be granted at line manager discretion where a positive COVID-19 test can be demonstrated (e.g., via photograph or copy of NHS registration), and where other options for alternative delivery of work have been exhausted.</p>

<p>The flow chart below illustrates the process on attendance and registering absence when COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Living with COVID-19 - process" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147513/Living_with_Covid.GOV.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>This arrangement will be monitored on a weekly basis, with guidance updated accordingly.</p>

<h2>Home and remote working guidance</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This guidance is intended to provide current information to line managers and employees to support home and remote working.</p>

<h3>Principles</h3>

<p>The safety and welfare of employees is at the heart of all guidance.</p>

<p>The contract of employment is a feature in all that we do.</p>

<p>Pragmatism and trust are fundamental principles in our guidance and all efforts should be made to work to its intent with flexibility and through a trusting relationship between line managers and employees.</p>

<h3>Line manager role</h3>

<p>Line managers should consider job role and activities and the most effective way of delivering the various elements of this.</p>

<p>Team members should feel that they have a safely assessed and appropriate environment and support to work collaboratively and productively each day.</p>

<p>Regular catch-ups and performance reviews should continue to take place with all employees, irrespective of their place of work.</p>

<p>The catch-ups should consider health and wellbeing, general guidance as well as reviewing work and delivery of outcomes.
 
Line managers should ensure employees have accessed the Display Screen Equipment (DSE) assessment via ATLAS.</p>

<p>To access the DSE assessment on ATLAS, one of our DSE assessors can send an ATLAS DSE link to employees. DSE assessors’ names can be found on the conventional safety intranet page.</p>

<p>Further details can be found in the Sellafield Ltd Management System – Control of Display Screen Equipment.</p>

<h3>Working hours</h3>

<p>This should be read in conjunction with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-guidance-for-employees-sellafield-ltd#pay-issues-and-policyprocedure-changes-update">pay policy</a> COVID-19 guidance.</p>

<p>Where possible all employees should be actively working towards fulfilling their contract of employment.</p>

<p>Employees should give consideration as to how they manage their working day and be mindful of working within the working time regulations, avoiding the risk of working longer hours, as there is not the same trigger to switch off if they don’t have to travel home.</p>

<p>Employees should record their actual working hours in line with departmental arrangements in OPMS.</p>

<p>Please note that any additional (credit) hours over normal working hours need to be pre authorised by the line manager, as per terms and conditions.</p>

<h3>Home office, DSE assessment and workplace adjustments</h3>

<p>Homeworkers with remote network access should complete the ATLAS DSE Assessment. If a wider risk assessment incorporating factors beyond DSE (e.g. heating or ventilation) is required, then this should be discussed with the line manager to discuss adjustments.</p>

<p>Once homeworkers have completed their DSE assessment, they should discuss any shortfalls with their DSE assessor to identify potential solutions and then discuss with their line manager.</p>

<p>If employees need equipment that they normally have at work (chair, large screen, wrist pads etc.) then they should speak to their line manager and it may be possible to arrange for it to be collected from their previous workplace.</p>

<p>Employees working from home are responsible for the condition of their home-working environment. The environment should be conducive to such work and all the necessary equipment should be fit for purpose.</p>

<p>It’s also recommended that individuals and line managers discuss the balance between home working and coming into the workplace to understand the most effective arrangement to allow the employee to work at their best.</p>

<h3>Wellbeing</h3>

<p>The physical and mental wellbeing of employees is a key feature of the regular check-ins with the line manager.</p>

<p>Employees should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep up regular contact with their manager and colleagues</li>
  <li>take regular breaks</li>
  <li>visit the EDI hub for guidance on health and well being</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-guidance-for-employees-sellafield-ltd#employee-support---welfare-and-wellbeing">Employee Assistance Programme</a> if they’d like professional support</li>
  <li>stay mentally and physically active</li>
  <li>continue to take annual leave in the normal way so that they have proper breaks from work</li>
  <li>check the intranet regularly if possible for wellbeing updates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Normal role</h3>

<p>As far as possible employees should continue to carry out their normal role, supported where possible with appropriate technology (laptop, blackberry) and IT access.  If this is an issue, it should be raised with the line manager.</p>

<h3>Improvement activity and additional work packages</h3>

<p>In line with the principles of My Contribution, all roles have an element of improvement activity that can be delivered. Employees should look at aspects of their role, or the team’s broader roles, that could be improved - processes or systems, or the way we do things.</p>

<h3>Managing your work</h3>

<p>Employees working remotely or from home must continue to adhere to all Sellafield Ltd policies in the same way as if in their normal workplace.</p>

<p>The working week should be structured so that employees can continue to be effective. This may require employees to attend the workplace to provide structure to their home working arrangements and ensure their personal well-being.</p>

<p>It’s recognised that flexibility will be required across all roles (e.g. individuals who work on plant may also be required to carry out tasks which do not require them to be plant based).</p>

<p>Employees working from home should be working in alignment with their personal and team objectives, or the current needs of our COVID-19 response.</p>

<p>Regular catch-ups and review of work should continue to take place with all employees, via an appropriate method.</p>

<p>An employee who is working from home should consider their own effectiveness at home and how they will manage potential sources of interruption. Issues should always be discussed with their line manager.</p>

<p>It is recognised that in some roles, owing to the nature of their duties or personal circumstances, it may not be an appropriate option to work from home.  In this instance, office working may be required.</p>

<h3>Sickness/Absence</h3>

<p>If an employee is sick and unable to work, they should inform their manager in the usual way on their first day of absence, before 9:00am so the line manager can record the absence and support their recovery.</p>

<h3>Daily logistics</h3>

<p>Employees working from home should be contactable during their normal working hours.</p>

<p>Employees should always make it clear to colleagues where they are working (for example, by stating this in their calendar) and how best to contact them (via email and specific phone number).</p>

<p>Employees should set up an out of the office message that tells people how to contact them and their current working arrangements.</p>

<p>Anyone with a company phone/blackberry, should set an appropriate voicemail message and also set their Skype/Lync location appropriately.</p>

<p>Meetings may take place using appropriate technologies to facilitate the participation of employees working from home.</p>

<p>Employees should be aware that home working does bring a range of responsibilities and the company still expects its employees to behave in line with the nuclear professionalism standards and expectations.</p>

<p>For example, in line with Standard 9 (personal responsibility), employees are expected to behave in a manner which does not discredit the company.</p>

<p>Likewise, employees should continue to be vigilant when accessing social media, by never connecting to accounts via company IT equipment (without explicit prior permission) and ensuring they do not post specific information about their job.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reminder – as people are “at work”, all rules and procedures still apply in line with company standards and expectations. Behavioural expectations should be followed (for example, alcohol consumption is still prohibited during the working day).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The company has made huge strides in providing IT equipment, with many employees now owners of  laptops and surface pros, as well as Blackberry’s and phones.</p>

<p>In addition; Microsoft Teams, Office 365 and the NDA Hub are all options being used as appropriate.</p>

<p>Ideally, most people will be able to avoid printing for work purposes while they do not have access to a work printer.</p>

<p>While using these different technology options and working from home, employees must comply with the company’s cyber security guidance.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-guidance-for-employees-sellafield-ltd#it-support-and-guidance-faqs">security</a> guidance applies to electronic and ‘hard copy’ information. When handling hard copy information/data with a higher protective marking than ‘OFFICIAL’, employees should seek guidance from their line manager and/or the Information Security Team.</p>

<h3>Training, development and upskilling</h3>

<p>Employees should continue to be creative and search out opportunities to develop, learn and self-improve.</p>

<p>Line managers should ensure time is made available to employees to support self-development and give guidance on what is suitable and in line with performance plans.</p>

<p>As well as the huge amount of opportunities and material available on the internet, the EDI hub also has a wealth of support material and upskilling options.</p>

<p>A number of employees also have access to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://leadership-academy.co.uk/login/index.php" rel="external">Leadership Academy VLE</a> – this holds a wide range of resources and materials.</p>

<p>The VLE can be accessed from non-networked devices, any eligible employees who haven’t got an account can contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:leadership.academy@sellafieldsites.com">leadership.academy@sellafieldsites.com</a> so that one can be created for them.</p>

<p>The Union Learning Centre is also a useful source of development.</p>

<h3>Insurance</h3>

<p>Sellafield Ltd Employers Liability Insurance covers employees working from home. This insurance policy is placed by the NDA.</p>

<p>The Association of British Insurers says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">If you are an office-based worker and need to work from home because of government advice or because you need to self-isolate, your home insurance cover will not be affected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ABI go on to state that there is no need to contact your insurer to update cover or extend your cover in the circumstances that you are currently working from home due to following government advice or the need to self-isolate.</p>

<p>So even if a home working arrangement appears to be ‘long term’, it’s not a permanent arrangement.</p>

<p>Supporting this, most insurers say that if you work from home occasionally, you are not classed as permanently working from home.</p>

<p>Any incident resulting in an injury which may result in a claim should be reported to your line manager as soon as possible and a condition report raised on ATLAS.</p>

<h3>Equipment and expenses</h3>

<p>Sellafield Ltd is working with employees to loan peripheral IT equipment (e.g. screen, mouse, keyboard) and office equipment/stationery where required to support home working in-line with DSE assessments.</p>

<p>This includes where possible to do so, specialist equipment that has previously been identified for reasonable adjustments. Employees should discuss any reasonable adjustments with their line manager.</p>

<p>If employees have a business need for a mobile phone, then the business case for a Sellafield Ltd procured phone should be made in the usual way.</p>

<p>Sellafield Ltd will not normally cover expenses but are willing to consider any specific issues on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Employees working from home may not claim travel expenses between home and their normal Sellafield Ltd work location.</p>

<p>Travel between working hours will be managed in line with existing arrangements.</p>

<h2>IT security advice - general information</h2>

<h3>Stolen devices</h3>

<p>Our devices are more at risk of being stolen (or lost/damaged) when they are away from the office or home. Not only does this present an increased risk of data loss and compromise, but due to the current situation our service providers will struggle to repair or replace equipment. Please take extra care during this period.</p>

<p>Corporate Blackberries can be remotely locked or erased to prevent data loss. As always, please report any lost devices as soon as possible to the ATOS helpdesk and line management.</p>

<p>Make sure you know how to report any problems. This is especially important for security issues.</p>

<p>You might feel more exposed to cyber threats when working outside the office environment, so we’ve put together some top tips on how to secure your personal devices should you be called upon to use them for work.</p>

<h3>VPNS</h3>

<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) create a network tunnel between you and another point on the internet. There are various free and paid for services that will provide features like anonymous web browsing.</p>

<p>If you use a VPN at home, you must not use it to process any Sellafield Ltd documents or communications. Often these services use various nodes around the world to route your traffic and achieve anonymity.</p>

<p>Given the data patriation rules for keeping all OFFICIAL content within the UK, VPNs should not be used unless accredited by the company.</p>

<h3>Physical connections</h3>

<p>Your device should only ever be recharged with trusted power adapters and cables.</p>

<p>Don’t physically connect corporate devices to any other without approval first, this includes USB, HDMI, Firewire etc.</p>

<p>SLSP 4.09.304 states that only Sellafield Ltd. approved devices can be connected to Sellafield Ltd assets.</p>

<p>Wireless devices such as wireless mice and keyboards are not permitted to be used with Sellafield Ltd laptops due to easily exploitable vulnerabilities. If you wanting to connect peripherals such as a keyboard and mouse to your machine, please ensure that they are wired devices and are from a reputable brand, e.g. HP.</p>

<h3>Spotting email scams</h3>

<p>Cyber criminals are preying on fears of the coronavirus and sending ‘phishing’ emails that try and trick users into clicking on a bad link.</p>

<p>Once clicked, the user is sent to a dodgy website which could download malware onto your computer or steal passwords. The scams may claim to have a ‘cure’ for the virus, offer a financial reward, or be encouraging you to donate.</p>

<p>Like many phishing scams, these emails are preying on real-world concerns to try and trick people into doing the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Please refer to our guidance on dealing with suspicious emails to learn more about spotting and dealing with phishing emails.</p>

<p>For genuine information about the virus, please use trusted resources such as the Public Health England or NHS websites.</p>

<h3>If you have already clicked onto a suspicious email</h3>

<p>The most important thing to do is not to panic. If you are on a corporate device follow the normal procedures, utilising the Spam Helpdesk and contacting the Atos Helpdesk. If you’re on a personal device there are number of practical steps, you can take as well as reporting the incident to us:</p>

<p>Open your antivirus (AV) software and run a full scan. Follow any instructions given. If you’ve been tricked into providing your password, you should change your passwords on all your other accounts.</p>

<p>If you have lost money, you need to report it as a crime to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/" rel="external">Action Fraud UK.</a></p>

<h3>If things go wrong</h3>

<p>When something goes wrong, or you suspect your device or its data may be compromised, it is important to take action promptly.</p>

<p>If you have any reason to suspect that someone else knows your password then it must be changed immediately -either on the device itself or via the Atos Helpdesk.</p>

<p>The same goes if you forget your password please contact via the Atos Helpdesk.</p>

<p>If you are experiencing problems with the device, you must never give your device to anyone else (e.g. a commercial repairer or IT savvy family member) to try to fix; always contact the ATOS helpdesk.</p>

<p>If you think someone may have tampered with your device (such as accessing the inside of it, or removing / replacing parts of it), stop using it immediately, turn it off, and contact us for assistance.</p>

<h3>Data Protection</h3>

<p>During these unprecedented times, there will undoubtedly be a need to share or use data relating to our employees and our wider community.</p>

<p>The need to act or react quickly may require teams or individuals to collect and use this data in haste. Whilst there is without doubt a valid and genuinely pressing reason, Data Protection Law must be considered in all cases.</p>

<p>For any advice or guidance relating to the use or collection of personal data please do not hesitate to contact the Data Protection Officer <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:data.protection.team@sellafieldsites.com">data.protection.team@sellafieldsites.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Atos remote fixes</h3>

<p>When Atos are required to implement fixes remotely onto individuals’ laptops, the use of an ethernet cable is sometimes required. The use of an ethernet cable to connect a Sellafield Ltd laptop to a home router is not allowed, so permission from Cyber Security is required before the fix can be implemented.</p>

<p>To gain permission for the use of ethernet cable, the individual’s line manager must email the following information to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Cyber.Security@Sellafieldsites.com">Cyber.Security@Sellafieldsites.com</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the precise time and date that the ethernet connection will be in place</li>
  <li>length of time that the laptop will be connected via ethernet cable</li>
  <li>how long the individual has had an RSA token/ remote access to the network</li>
  <li>the business justification and priority for the fix being applied</li>
  <li>the laptop asset number</li>
  <li>ATOS request number</li>
</ul>

<p>Cyber Security will then decide whether a cabled connection will be allowed and offer relevant advice to the individual.</p>

<h3>Working abroad</h3>

<p>For requests to take Sellafield Ltd IT (Laptops) abroad, an email must be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Information.Risk@Sellafieldsites.com">Information.Risk@Sellafieldsites.com</a>.</p>

<p>The email should contain the details of request e.g. country/duration/access arrangements/storage information, the Asset ID and confirmation of line manager’s approval.</p>

<p>There should also be a robust business justification as to why you require the Sellafield Ltd assets abroad.</p>

<p>Requests to take a Blackberry abroad can be done via Service Now under “Enable blackberry for business use abroad”.</p>

<p>The NDA Hub can be accessed abroad on a personal device however, information must not be downloaded onto a personal device for printing.</p>

<p>MS Teams cannot be accessed abroad.</p>

<p>Hard copy information is not to be taken abroad.</p>

<h2>Employee support - Welfare and wellbeing</h2>

<p>During these unprecedented and difficult times weare keen to ensure friends, colleagues and employees are aware of the ongoing support available.</p>

<p>The support that we would usually offer our colleagues when they are going through a difficult period such as bereavement, grief and other family issues remains the same.</p>

<p>It is hard to provide guidance for all employees on the best way to work from home – some people will benefit from the routine and structure of the working day, whereas others will prefer working at quieter times or where there are less distractions.</p>

<p>The important thing is that people find a way of working that is right for them and ensures they’re able to do what they need to.</p>

<p>With lots of our employees now working from home, it’s more difficult to access some of our usual welfare and wellbeing services. This includes our network of mental health champions, who might not be available or might be dealing with unusual circumstances of their own.</p>

<p>Line managers should check in with their employees (home working or otherwise) regularly.</p>

<p>There are lots of other useful sources of information. We have listed some of these below:</p>

<h3>Mental health charities</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rethink.org/" rel="external">Rethink Mental Health</a> has set up an online hub filled with practical support and information for people living with or supporting people with mental illness</p>
