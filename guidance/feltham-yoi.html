<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Feltham</h2>

<p>You may not be able to speak with someone at Feltham during their first few days. This is because it can take time to approve who they can be in touch with.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>
<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels (property)</h3>
<p>People in Feltham have a list of approved items that can be given to them by family and friends.</p>

<p>Prisoners must first apply for permission to receive items. Feltham then sends the family member or friend an approved stamp to fix to their parcel.</p>

<p>Family and friends can then hand in the parcel before visits on the following days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feltham A (15 to 18 year olds): Monday, Wednesday and Sunday</li>
  <li>Feltham B (18 to 21 year olds): Monday, Wednesday and Saturday (afternoon visits only)</li>
</ul>

<p>Items should be handed in to the property desk in the visitors centre which opens 30 minutes before visiting times.</p>

<p>You must have a visit booked for the time you hand anything in, otherwise it won’t be accepted.</p>

<p>Items are not normally accepted by post. However, a prisoner who does not get visits can apply for permission for a family member or friend to send items in. These parcels must also be marked with an approved stamp. Feltham takes no responsibility for items sent in the post.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the prisoners name and prison number on parcels. All items will be opened and inspected by an officer.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners"><abbr title="Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service">HMPPS</abbr> Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>

<p>The units all have phones, showers, laundry facilities and a social area with table tennis tables and other games. Rooms all include a sink and toilet.</p>

<h3>Behaviour</h3>

<h3>Free time</h3>

<p>Young people take part in sports and fitness, skills workshops and other activities in their free time. They can also spend time in the library.</p>

<h3>Faith services</h3>

<p>A large number of volunteers work with the chaplaincy at Feltham to give all young people access to religious services and multi-faith rooms, whatever their faith.</p>
