<p>You should follow separate guidance if you’ve been in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">a country or territory on the red list</a> in the 10 days before you arrive in England. There are currently no countries or territories on the red list.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for people who have a legal duty to self-isolate at home or in the place they’re staying after international travel because they do not qualify for fully vaccinated rules and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get a positive or unclear result in their arrival PCR test</li>
  <li>do not take an arrival PCR test</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination">Check if you qualify as fully vaccinated</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england">Read the rules on who needs to self-isolate at home after international travel</a>.</p>

<h2>Self-isolation checks - what they are</h2>

<p>If you have to self-isolate at home or in the place you’re staying after international travel, NHS Test and Trace may contact you daily to confirm you’re following the self-isolation rules.</p>

<p>In addition, you may be visited at home by someone carrying out checks on behalf of NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you break the self-isolation rules, you may face a penalty of up to £10,000.</p>
</div>

<h2>Being contacted by NHS Test and Trace</h2>

<p>Contact tracers from NHS Test and Trace may contact you daily, using text messages, email or phone calls.</p>

<p>Contact tracers will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>call you from 0300 123 2008</li>
  <li>send you text messages from ‘NHS’</li>
  <li>ask for your full name and date of birth to confirm your identity</li>
</ul>

<h3>What contract tracers will not do</h3>

<p>Contact tracers will never:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask you to dial a premium rate number to speak to us (for example, those starting 09 or 087)</li>
  <li>ask you to make any form of payment or purchase a product of any kind</li>
  <li>ask for any details about your bank account</li>
  <li>ask for your social media identities or login details, or those of your contacts</li>
  <li>ask you for any passwords or PINs, or ask you to set up any passwords or PINs over the phone</li>
  <li>disclose any of your personal or medical information to your contacts</li>
  <li>provide medical advice on the treatment of any potential COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>ask you to download any software to your computer or ask you to hand over control of your computer, smartphone or tablet to anyone else</li>
  <li>ask you to access any website that does not belong to the government or NHS</li>
</ul>

<h2>In-person visits</h2>

<p>Staff employed on behalf of the NHS Test and Trace service may come to the address listed on your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">passenger locator form</a>.</p>

<h3>How to identify staff</h3>

<p>Staff will be wearing NHS Test and Trace branded clothing. They will identify themselves verbally and present an ID card with information including their name, role and employer.</p>

<h3>What to expect from a visit</h3>

<p>The staff will state your name and ask you to confirm it. They will also ask to see identification                     to confirm your identity. They will then ask you a few questions to find out if you are following quarantine rules, and will give you additional information or guidance where necessary.</p>

<p>You may receive follow-up visits.</p>

<h3>What happens if staff think you’re not following self-isolation rules</h3>

<p>If the staff carrying out the checks have reason to believe you may be breaching self-isolation rules, they may refer your case to the police. If the police have reasonable grounds to believe that you have committed a criminal offence in breach of your duty to self-isolate, they may issue you with a fine (fixed penalty notice). Fines start at £1,000 for a first offence and can increase up to £10,000 for repeat offences.</p>

<h3>What staff will not do</h3>

<p>Staff working on behalf of NHS Test and Trace staff do not have enforcement powers, including the power to issue fixed penalty notices or fines. This means they will never ask you for money.</p>

<p>They will only ask you questions relating to your duty to self-isolate.</p>

<p>They will never:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask you to provide your name. Staff will already have your name and will ask ‘Am I speaking to —–?’ for you to confirm</li>
  <li>ask for your financial details, such as your bank or credit card information</li>
  <li>ask you for money or issue a fine: staff working on behalf of NHS Test and Trace have no legal power to issue a fixed penalty notice or a fine - only the police can issue fixed penalty notices for breaching self-isolation rules</li>
  <li>ask for your National Insurance number, telephone number or any other identifying information, other than your passport or driving licence</li>
  <li>enter your home</li>
</ul>

<p>If someone visits you claiming to be from NHS Test and Trace and you believe they are lying, call 999 and ask for the police.</p>

<h2>How to complain</h2>

<p>If you’re not happy with the service - either phone checks or in-person visits – you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://enquiries.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/s/" rel="external">complain to NHS Test and Trace online</a> or telephone 119.</p>
