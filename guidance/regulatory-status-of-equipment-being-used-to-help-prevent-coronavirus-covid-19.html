From 1 July 2023, new goods placed on the Great Britain market will need to conform with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medical-devices-conformity-assessment-and-the-ukca-mark">UKCA marking requirements</a>. Separate rules exist for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

<h2>Antimicrobial hand sanitisers and gels</h2>

<p>Hand sanitising products fall into 1 of 3 regulatory groups depending on the products’ intended use, function, composition or how they are described: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Products primarily used to clean and/or moisturise skin whilst providing a secondary antimicrobial effect such as a liquid soap or solid soap bars, are classed as a cosmetic</li>
  <li>Products primarily claiming to kill germs, disinfect or sanitise or using an active antimicrobial ingredient such as the hand sanitisers used in hospitals, are classed as a biocide</li>
  <li>Products specifically used as surgical scrubs for use in operating theatres and products which make claims to treat/prevent infection associated with specifically named pathogens are classed as medicines</li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend that you contact your local Trading Standards Office for initial advice on the regulations that might apply to your specific product. You may also find that the relevant trade associations may be able to provide information and advice. </p>

<h3>If a product is a cosmetic</h3>
<p>The regulations that apply are the Cosmetic Product Regulations. These are regulated through your local trading standards. There is <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.businesscompanion.info/en/quick-guides/product-safety/cosmetic-products">guidance</a> and you can use the ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-trading-standards-office" class="govuk-link">find my local <abbr title="trading standards">TS</abbr> Service</a>’ tool.</p>

<h3>If a product is a biocide</h3>
<p>There is more than one regulation that may apply. These are regulated through the Health and Safety Executive. For guidance contact <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:biocidesenquiries@hse.gov.uk">biocidesenquiries@hse.gov.uk</a> and there is <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/biocides/basics.htm">guidance</a>.</p>

<p>There is additional <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/hand-sanitiser-manufacture-supply-coronavirus.htm" class="govuk-link">information on the supply of biocidal hand sanitisers</a>.</p>

<h3>If a product is a medicine</h3>
<p>A Marketing Authorisation is required. General hand sanitiser products are not permitted to name specific pathogens.</p>

<p>Claims to treat or prevent infection associated with specifically named pathogens (such as SARS-CoV-2) could bring the product within the remit of the medicines regulations. Please refer to Appendix 5 in <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759581/012__GN8_-_final_2018_combined_doc_Oct.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s Guidance note 8 – a guide to what is a medicinal product</a> for further information. </p>

<p>If you require further information and advice with respect to the naming of specific pathogens please contact the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Medicines Borderline Section at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:borderline_medicine@mhra.gov.uk">borderline_medicine@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>HMRC changes to help businesses producing hand sanitiser and gel</h3>
<p>To stop the spread of coronavirus HMRC has made <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/producing-hand-sanitiser-and-gel-for-coronavirus-covid-19">temporary changes to the use and supply of denatured alcohol and duty-free spirits</a>, to help businesses who produce hand sanitiser and gel.</p>
</div>

<h2>Face masks and face coverings</h2>

<p>The regulations are different depending on the type of product.</p>

<h3>Surgical (medical) face masks</h3>
<p>These are mainly intended for health care staff to wear to protect patients during surgical procedures and other medical settings.</p>

<p>If you make a surgical mask, intended to protect the patient, they are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-class-1-medical-devices">Class I medical devices</a>. They must meet the design and safety requirements of the UK Medical Device Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (UK <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr> 2002) and be <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>, <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI or UKCA marked before you can sell them in the UK.</p>

<p>If they are not <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>/<abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI/UKCA marked you must apply for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exemptions-from-devices-regulations-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">exemption from the regulations</a>. We may authorise you to supply a non-<abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>/<abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI/UKCA marked device in the interest of protecting health.</p>

<p>If the surgical masks you want to supply are sterile, then you also need a <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>, <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI or UKCA certificate from an EU Notified Body or UK Approved Body (please read as UK Notified Body in this document for the purposes of Northern Ireland) for the sterility aspects. We regulate these types of masks and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-class-1-medical-devices" class="govuk-link">Guidance on Class 1 Medical Devices</a> gives further information.</p>

<h3>Face masks intended to protect the wearer (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h3>
<p>If your masks are intended to protect the wearer, they are regulated as personal protective equipment and need to meet the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/mechanical-engineering/personal-protective-equipment_en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">regulations covering <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> products</a>. They will need an EU Notified Body/UK Approved Body to verify the relevant requirements are met. They are not medical devices.</p>

<p>If you need advice on these regulations, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/opss-coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-business-and-local-authorities" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Office for Product Safety and Standards">OPSS</abbr> coronavirus guidance for business and local authorities</a>.</p>

<h3>Face coverings</h3>
<p>Face coverings intended for use by the general public are not <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> or medical devices. As such they do not carry a <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>/<abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI/UKCA mark and should not be sold or donated as <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> or medical devices.</p>

<p>If you wish to sell face coverings or supply them to others outside your household or family, the face coverings must meet the existing requirements of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1803/contents/made" rel="external" class="govuk-link">General Product Safety Regulations 2005 (<abbr title="General Product Safety Regulations">GPSR</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="General Product Safety Regulations">GPSR</abbr> sets out the responsibilities of the producers and distributors of these products.</p>

<p>As face coverings are not medical devices, we do not regulate these products. There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/opss-coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-business-and-local-authorities#opss-covid-19-guidance-for-businesses" class="govuk-link">guidance for makers and suppliers of face coverings</a> from the Office for Product Safety and Standards.</p>

<h2>Gloves</h2>
<p>If the gloves you make are intended to be used by healthcare professionals to protect the patient during a medical examination or during a surgical procedure, these examination gloves or surgical gloves are regulated as medical devices.</p>

<p>They must meet the design and safety requirements of the <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr> 2002 and need to be <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>, <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI or UKCA marked as medical devices before you can sell them in the UK, or you may be able to apply for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exemptions-from-devices-regulations-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">exemption from the regulations</a>.</p>

<h3>Examination gloves</h3>
<p>Examination gloves are usually considered to be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-class-1-medical-devices">Class I medical devices</a>, and you can self-certify them as such, but if they are supplied sterile, they will also need a <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>, <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI or UKCA certificate from a notified body for the sterility aspects. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-class-1-medical-devices">guidance on Class 1 Medical Devices</a>.</p>

<h3>Surgical gloves</h3>
<p>Surgical gloves are usually considered to be Class IIa medical devices and need a <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>, <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI or UKCA certificate from a UK Approved Body or EU Notified Body. See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medical-devices-conformity-assessment-and-the-ukca-mark" class="govuk-link">guidance on conformity assessment of medical devices</a>.</p>

<p>If either type of glove is coated with an antimicrobial agent, they are likely to be considered as devices incorporating medicinal substances and therefore Class III devices under Part II of the UK <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr> 2002, Annex IX (as modified by Schedule 2A to the UK <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr> 2002) and will need a <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>, <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI or UKCA certificate from a UK Approved Body or EU Notified Body.  See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medical-devices-conformity-assessment-and-the-ukca-mark">guidance on conformity assessment of medical devices</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> gloves</h3>
<p>If the gloves you make are intended to protect the wearer (for example for use in laboratories or for other protective purposes) then they are considered personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) and need to meet the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/mechanical-engineering/personal-protective-equipment_en">regulations covering <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> products</a>. They will need a UK Approved Body or EU Notified Body to verify the relevant requirements are met. They are not medical devices.</p>

<p>If you need advice on these regulations, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/opss-coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-business-and-local-authorities"><abbr title="Office for Product Safety and Standards">OPSS</abbr> coronavirus guidance for business and local authorities</a>.</p>

<p>The UK <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr> 2002 contains rules for gloves that are intended to be used both as medical devices and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>  and as such have a ‘dual use’. In such cases they will need to meet the relevant requirements of the UK <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr> 2002 and the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> regulation.</p>

<h3>Further <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> advice</h3>
<p>After reading the relevant guidance for medical devices, if you have any further questions, contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:devices.regulatory@mhra.gov.uk">devices.regulatory@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>There is further information in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/medicines-medical-devices-blood/medical-devices-regulation-safety">Medical devices regulation and safety</a> guidance and our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulating-medical-devices-in-the-uk">guidance on the regulating medical devices in the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Failure to comply with the relevant regulations</h2>

<h3>Medical devices</h3>
<p>If you claim to hold a valid <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>, <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI or UKCA mark for a medical device but are breaching the regulations, typically, you will be contacted by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> compliance unit outlining our concerns and requesting further information.</p>

<p>We administer and enforce the law on medical devices in the UK.  We have a range of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-a-non-compliant-medical-device-enforcement-process/how-mhra-ensures-the-safety-and-quality-of-medical-devices" class="govuk-link">investigatory and enforcement powers</a> to ensure their safety and quality.</p>

<h3>Medicines (for human use)</h3>
<p>Similarly, there are robust regulatory controls for medicinal products including their manufacture, distribution, retail sale / supply and advertising. Under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, breaches of legal requirements constitute criminal offences and the legislation empowers <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> officers to undertake investigations using powers of entry, seizure and detention. Criminal prosecutions can be brought through the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).</p>

<h3>Personal protective equipment</h3>
<p>If you claim to hold a valid <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr>, <abbr title="Certification Mark">CE</abbr> UKNI or UKCA mark for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/390/pdfs/uksiem_20180390_en.pdf" rel="external">enforcement authorities in the UK</a> such as trading standards authorities and the Health and Safety Executive), will be able to take action against ‘economic operators’ (i.e. manufacturers, importers and distributors) if they do not comply with the obligations in EU <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Regulation.</p>
