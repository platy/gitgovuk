<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK’s stand-alone medicines and medical devices regulator, taking any decisions and carrying out any functions which were taken or carried out at <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-level except for decisions on Marketing Authorisation (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>) applications made through the European procedures to market products in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>General approach to grandfathering of <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Products">CAPs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>All existing <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> have been automatically converted into UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> effective in Great Britain (only) and issued with a UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> number on 1 January 2021. These UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> are referred to in this guidance as “converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>”. As a result of the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, existing <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Products">CAPs</abbr> will remain valid for marketing products in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> can choose to opt-out of the conversion process for all or some of their <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Products">CAPs</abbr> by notifying the MHRA in writing following which those UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> will be revoked. To opt out you must let the MHRA know by the end of 21 January 2021.</p>

<p><abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> for <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Products">CAPs</abbr> that are not currently marketed in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or UK can still be converted to Great Britain <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>. For the purposes of operating the Sunset Clause in accordance with regulation 67 Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended), the period of three years during which the product has not been marketed in Great Britain will be restarted from the date of conversion to a Great Britain <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>To facilitate the grandfathering process, the MHRA will issue one or more Product Licence (<abbr title="Product License">PL</abbr>) numbers to <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Products">CAPs</abbr> based on the existing UK practice for determining how many separate national licences are needed across a product range. In most cases this means that fewer UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> numbers will be needed in comparison with the number of European Commission authorisations because all pack sizes for a presentation will be covered by a single <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> number.</p>

<p>The format of the UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> valid only in Great Britain will be PLGB XXXXX/YYYY where XXXXX is the company number and YYYY is a sequential number for individual products. Where a <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> already has a company number allocated by MHRA for existing national licences, that number will be used. If the <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> does not have a company number allocated by MHRA then an application form for a number will be required.</p>

<p>There is no fee associated with the conversion from a <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> to a Great Britain <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> chooses to opt-out, their product(s) will no longer be licensed and must not be marketed in Great Britain. The MHRA will publish a list of products that have and have not been converted as a result of this exercise.</p>

<p>To support the ongoing regulation of these converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>, the MHRA needs essential baseline data to be submitted in the form of an initiating electronic Common Technical Document (<abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr>) sequence together with certain other related <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>-specific information for each converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> will have a period of one year starting on 1 January 2021 to submit this data and related information in <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> format. Until these initiating sequences are submitted and processed, it will not be possible to submit a variation for the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> unless there are exceptional circumstances relating to public health. There is no fee for the grandfathering process.</p>

<p>As with all national <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>, an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees/current-mhra-fees" class="govuk-link">annual service fee</a> will be due for converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> from 1 April 2021 unless the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> opts out by the required date.</p>

<h2>Actions that holders of converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> need to take</h2>

<h2>1. What to submit in the initiating sequence and other related information</h2>

<p>Within the period of one year starting on 1 January 2021, the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> must submit the following information to the MHRA for each converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>. (This is the information which is specified in paragraph 9(3)(a) of new Schedule 33A to the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, as inserted by the Human Medicines (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019).</p>

<p>The data submission package must contain:</p>

<p>a) cover letter and declaration that only approved documentation is included in the initiating sequence. The cover letter should clearly identify the submission as a “<abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> Grandfathering Submission” in the title. The cover letter should also confirm whether a nitrosamine risk evaluation has been submitted in accordance with the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion under Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 on the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products, or whether it is pending. If already submitted, the conclusion of the risk evaluation should be stated.</p>

<p>b) a single <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> initiating sequence for the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> representing the currently authorised and approved position. Where more than one dosage form or strength will be converted for the same product trade name, it is expected these will be handled as one <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> dossier. If the product dossier refers to an Active Substance Master File, the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> must ask the active substance supplier to submit that to MHRA if they have not already done so. We have published guidance on how to do this</p>

<p>c) a completed electronic application form (<abbr title="electronic Application Form">eAF</abbr>) for each converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>d) a summary list of all historical regulatory activity from the grant date of the original <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> until the data is submitted. This will include:</p>

<p>I. type of submission (such as initial new Marketing Authorisation Applications (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Applications">MAA</abbr>), Variation, Periodic Safety Update Report (<abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr>), Renewal)</p>

<p>II. the date of submission to the European Medicines Agency (<abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr>) (optional if the outcome date is available)</p>

<p>III. summary of the submission (such as a short description of a variation)</p>

<p>IV. regulatory outcome (such as granted or not granted)</p>

<p>V. the date of the outcome</p>

<p>VI. <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequence number of the submission (only for <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> format submissions)</p>

<p>Alternatively, the historical document can mirror the format of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedural steps document if this makes it easier to create.</p>

<p>e) notification of whether or not the product referred to in the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> is on the Great Britain market at the time the notification is given. If it is not, the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> must tell us whether the product has been on the Great Britain market at any time after 1 January 2021 and, if so, the date it was withdrawn from the market (for the purposes of Article 23a and Article 24 (4-6) of Directive 2001/83EC – as implemented in regulations 67 and 73 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012), the “Sunset Clause”). This information may be included in the cover letter. .</p>

<p>f) the Summary of Product Characteristics (<abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SmPC</abbr>) currently approved by corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure both in pdf format and in the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/786333/SPC_template.docx" class="govuk-link">SPC template</a></p>

<p>g) the packaging labels and leaflets as currently approved by the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure which are:</p>

<p>I. the outer packaging of the medicinal product;</p>

<p>II. the immediate packaging of the medicinal product; and</p>

<p>III. the package leaflet for the medicinal product.</p>

<h2>2. What to submit if the converted licence should be cancelled in mainland UK between 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2021</h2>

<p><abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> will have a period of one year starting on 1 January 2021 to submit the data and related information in <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> format for all converted licences. If an application is not submitted before 31 December 2021 the licence will be considered to be cancelled.</p>

<p>Any converted Centralised licence that is required on the UK market but has not had a submission made before the 31 December 2021 can only be re-registered through submission of a new application to the MHRA at the normal cost and will require a new assessment to be completed prior to marketing the product.</p>

<p>If a converted licence is to be cancelled in mainland UK, the MHRA requests that a basic submission (see below for requirements) is made with a request to cancel the <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> licence which will be processed after basic licence details have been recorded. This will allow the MHRA database to have a record for all licences that were converted to national licences on 1 January 2021. Any licences cancelled by <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> before 31 December 2020 do not need to be registered.</p>

<h3>What to submit for a converted licence that should be cancelled before 1 January 2022</h3>
<p>The data submission package must contain:</p>

<p>a) a single <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> initiating sequence for the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>(s) containing the following documents. Where more than one dosage form or strength is converted for the same product trade name, it is expected these will be handled as one <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> dossier.</p>

<p>b) cover letter The cover letter should clearly identify the submission as a “<abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> Grandfathering Submission” in the title and include the statement that the licence should be cancelled in mainland UK.
c) a completed electronic application form (<abbr title="electronic Application Form">eAF</abbr>) for each converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>d) the Summary of Product Characteristics (<abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SmPC</abbr>) currently approved by corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure both in pdf format and in the SPC template</p>

<p>e) the packaging labels and leaflets as currently approved by the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure which are:</p>

<p>I. the outer packaging of the medicinal product;</p>

<p>II. the immediate packaging of the medicinal product; and</p>

<p>III. the package leaflet for the medicinal product.</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> submission has been made before November but an approval letter has not been received by 1 December please contact the Customer service team who will be able to ensure the application is completed before the deadline.</p>

<h2>3. Further advice on documentation</h2>

<p>The summary of historical regulatory activity (section d above) must be included in the Working Documents folder of the <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> and the notification of marketing status (section e above) must be included in the cover letter.</p>

<p>The cover letter, electronic Application Form (<abbr title="electronic Application Form">eAF</abbr>) and currently approved <abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SmPC</abbr>, Packaging and Patient Information Leaflet (<abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr>) must be included in the appropriate folders in Module 1 of the <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequence.</p>

<p>The submission must reflect only what is relevant to the product intended for Great Britain so that this can be used as the start of the lifecycle for the nationally registered product(s). Inclusion of non-UK specific information could, over time, lead to inaccurate information held within the database and may lead to difficulties with the technical validation of subsequent submissions.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequence must pass technical validation (sections 4 and 5 below). The MHRA will apply an abbreviated content validation and will not issue a validation report, the presence of a <abbr title="Summary of Product Characteristics">SmPC</abbr>, <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> and packing information are mandatory.</p>

<p>The MHRA expects that all information representing the currently authorised and approved position that has previously been submitted in <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> format will be included in the initiating sequence submission. However, it is acknowledged that some information may not be available in electronic format, particularly for older products, and that it may not be possible for the initiating sequence to be entirely complete.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> should submit what is available and the MHRA will accept a partially completed sequence, provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> makes all reasonable endeavours to include any information available in an electronic format other than <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> format, in the appropriate <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> structure in accordance with <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> technical validation criteria.  Avoid placing documents in the Working Documents section of the <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> structure and use it by exception only.</li>
</ul>

<p>The holder of the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> responds to a request to provide any information related to the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> either before or after submission of the initiating sequence, including historical information, within the time period specified in the request.</p>

<h2>4. How to submit the application</h2>

<p>Except for applications made through European procedures to market in Northern Ireland, the MHRA does not expect to be able to receive submissions through the Common European Submission Portal (<abbr title="Common European Submission Portal">CESP</abbr>). We have developed a new national portal  and submissions will be made via this portal.</p>

<h2>5. Specific advice on preparing the initiating sequence</h2>
<p>Background information on the latest version of the <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> standard, including <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> guidance on Module 1 information and the electronic application form <a rel="external" href="http://esubmission.ema.europa.eu/ectd/" class="govuk-link">can be found on the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> e-submissions website</a>.</p>

<p>The date on which the minimal or full initiating sequence is received is referred to as “the data submission date”. The <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> should construct a single, technically valid, <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequence (the “Converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> Initiating Sequence”) showing the current, approved information (“current authorised view”) of the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>(s) on the data submission date.</p>

<p>Information that has been “replaced” or “deleted” during the life cycle of the <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> that the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> is derived from should not be included.</p>

<p>The sequence should be assigned as sequence number 0000, submission type “<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Applications">maa</abbr>” and submission unit assigned as “initial”.</p>

<p>Points to consider:</p>

<p>a) Only include Great Britain relevant information. Remove previous cover letters and application forms, and remove all product information except Great Britain specific information.</p>

<p>b)  Remove all <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> information. <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> will not need to be submitted in the <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> lifecycle.</p>

<p>c) Historical <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> information about the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance">PV</abbr> Master File, etc. in module 1.8. is not required. New information must be submitted as a later type IA variation.</p>

<p>d) Remove all responses to questions in module 1 - i.e. remove any discussion and only show the outcome in terms of the documents in the rest of modules 1-5.</p>

<p>e) The submission must include a full <abbr title="electronic Application Form">eAF</abbr>) for each of the products in the application. The “Initial <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Applications">MAA</abbr>” <abbr title="electronic Application Form">eAF</abbr> should be used with the initiating sequence and only approved information should be included - any changes to the approved information must be submitted as a variation after the submission of the initiating sequence using the normal process for variations to national <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> (see information on variations in sections 6 - 8).</p>

<p>f) The summary of historical regulatory activity must begin with the original <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Product">CAP</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Applications">MAA</abbr> submission and continue up to the data submission date. This must be a list of the submission events in a table format, not the individual <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequences that were submitted for each event (noting that for some products these events will predate the <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr>). Please submit this in the same format as the tracking table in module 1.0.</p>

<p>g) The initiating sequence must be a valid <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> submission, built to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> module 1 v3.0.2 and <abbr title="International Council for Harmonisation">ICH</abbr> v3.2.2 standards or, if these are superseded, by such standards that are applicable at the time of submission. Non-functioning hyperlinks are acceptable if they are unavoidable.</p>

<p>h) The initiating sequence should include multiple dosage forms and strengths in a single <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> dossier lifecycle.</p>

<h2>6.	Submitting the initiating sequence in two steps</h2>

<p>The MHRA strongly prefers <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> submit the initiating sequence as a single event. However, it is recognised that some <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> may need to submit variations, renewals or Article 61(3) notifications to the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> before they can produce the complete initiating sequence.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> can use a two-step process by first submitting a minimal initiating sequence containing at least the mandatory documents at an early point following 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The mandatory documents are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those described in section 1f) and 1g)</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="electronic Application Form">eAF</abbr> containing at least the mandatory information (as defined in the <abbr title="electronic Application Form">eAF</abbr> section 1c))</li>
  <li>a cover letter and declaration (see section 1a)).</li>
  <li>a statement in the cover letter that this is a minimal initiating sequence and commitment to send the complete initiating sequence within a period of one year starting on 1 January 2021.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sequence must also be technically valid (see section 4g) above).</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> take this approach, a further complete initiating sequence, containing all documents electronically and the specific other related information defined in section 2, must still be submitted within a period of one year starting on 1 January 2021. The sequence number of this submission should be sequential to the earlier minimal initiating sequence and any subsequent variations or other submissions.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> submit an early minimal initiating sequence we advise making every effort to include Module 3 (quality) documents. This module is frequently varied and, if the documents are not available, any subsequent variation to M3 is likely to be delayed by the need to request missing data.</p>

<h2>7.	General approach to variations to converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>In general, the MHRA will not consider variations to converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> before at least a minimal initiating sequence (as defined in section 5) and related documentation (the “data submission package”) have been submitted. The date on which the minimal or full initiating sequence is received is referred to as the data submission date.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, we may consider a variation before the data submission date if, in our view, the following circumstances apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the variation is necessary on urgent safety grounds</li>
  <li>the variation is necessary in order to maintain supplies of a particular medicinal product to patients in Great Britain</li>
  <li>there are other necessary or beneficial reasons for considering the variation in advance of receipt of the baseline information</li>
</ul>

<p>If the holder of a converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> considers that these conditions may apply, they should contact the agency’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-mhra#regulatory-information-service-ris">Regulatory Information Service</a> to ask for agreement from MHRA and discuss how to proceed.</p>

<p>Variation applications may be included with the data submission package as separate <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequences in line with the normal national <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> variation process. However the variation will only be considered after the baseline is processed and will be treated as if it was submitted after the data submission date.</p>

<p>The table at the bottom of this page provides a summary of the approach to variations that MHRA will take in the different scenarios which may arise.</p>

<h2>8.	Approach to variations submitted to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> but not granted before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>To simplify handling of variation submissions the MHRA has adopted a pragmatic approach to these submissions.</p>

<h3>Type IA and Type IB Variations</h3>

<p>For minor variations of Type IA and Type 1B, these may be implemented in relation to the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> at the same time as they are implemented in relation to the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>. The variation must be included in the initiating sequence submission as if it had already been accepted in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> must inform the MHRA when submitting the sequence if the variation was rejected or refused by the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> after 1 January 2021 but before the data submission date, and the variation must be removed from the initiating sequence.</p>

<p>The variations will be deemed to be accepted unless the holder of the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> is notified, within 30 days of the data submission date, that it has been rejected.</p>

<p>The details of the variations must be included in the summary of historical regulatory activity submitted with the initiating sequence</p>

<h3>Type II Variations</h3>

<p>For major variations of type II, if the variation had reached positive Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (<abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr>) opinion stage before 1 January 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the variation must be included within the initiating sequence submission as if it had already been accepted in Great Britain</li>
  <li>the variation may be implemented in relation to the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> at the same time as it is implemented in relation to the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the details of the type II variation must be included in the summary of historical regulatory activity submitted with the initiating sequence</li>
  <li>no fee will apply for these variations</li>
  <li>the MHRA will notify the holder of the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> marketing authorisation within 30 days beginning with the data submission date if the variation is rejected, in which case the holder must cease to apply the rejected variation immediately after receipt of the notification.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the Type II variation had not reached <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion and at 1 January 2021 was in clock-stop following a request for further information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the variation application must be included in the data submission package as a separate <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequence (sequence 0001 and so on)</li>
  <li>the variation will only be considered after the initiating sequence is processed.</li>
  <li>no fee will apply for these variations. Great Britain will review responses when submitted.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the Type II variation had not reached <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion and at 1 January 2021 was before clock-stop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the variation application must be included in the data submission package as a separate <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequence (sequence 0001 and so on).</li>
  <li>the variation will only be considered after the initiating sequence is processed.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees/current-mhra-fees" class="govuk-link">appropriate fee will apply</a> for these variations and the variation will be reviewed by MHRA.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the applicant wishes for the variation to be put on hold pending finalisation by the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr>, this should be clearly indicated in the cover letter of each relevant variation, either at the time of initial submission or where relevant the submission of the responses to the MHRA.</p>

<p>When the procedure has been positively concluded by the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> or a positive <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion has been given, evidence of this should be provided to the MHRA, including if available a copy of the final assessment report, along with any required dossier updates which have occurred during the assessment process. The MHRA will determine the national variation based on the available information according to the recognition route.</p>

<h2>9.	Approach to variations to converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> applied for from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>This advice applies where the holder of a converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> has notified the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> of, or applied to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> for, a variation of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> from 1 January 2021 either before or after the data submission date and intends the variation to be made in relation to the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Type IA Variations</h3>
<p>For minor variations of Type IA  these may be implemented in relation to the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> at the same time as they are implemented in relation to the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>. The variation must be included in the initiating sequence submission as if it had already been accepted in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> must inform the MHRA when submitting the sequence if the variation was rejected by the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> from 1 January 2021 but before the data submission date, and the variation must be removed from the initiating sequence.</p>

<p>The variation will be deemed to be accepted unless the holder of the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> is notified, within 30 days of the data submission date, that it has been rejected.</p>

<p>The details of the variation must be included in the summary of historical regulatory activity submitted with the initiating sequence.</p>

<p>Any Type IA variation submitted after the baseline submission will be processed in accordance with MHRA practice.</p>

<h3>Type IB and Type II Variations</h3>

<p>For minor variations of type IB, and major variations of type II, if the variation has not been rejected by the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> before the data submission date, a copy of the variation application must be included in the data submission package as a separate <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequence (sequence 0001 and so on). The variation will only be considered after the baseline is processed.</p>

<p>Type IB/II variations will be reviewed by MHRA and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees/current-mhra-fees">the appropriate fee will apply</a>.</p>

<h4>Pending variations at the time of baseline submission</h4>

<p>See relevant text in section 7 under Type II variations, where the same approaches can be followed i.e. the variations can be put on hold pending approval of the corresponding centralised variation.</p>

<h4>New variations submitted after the baseline submission has been processed</h4>

<p>If the identical changes have already been approved for the corresponding centralised product and provided evidence of this is included when the submission is made to the MHRA, the variations will be processed under the recognition route.</p>

<p>The table at the bottom of this page provides a summary of the approach to variations that MHRA will take in the different scenarios which may arise.</p>

<h2>10. General approach to renewals to converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>For the purpose of renewals, converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> are treated as if they were granted on the date on which the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> was granted. The converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> will therefore have the same renewal date in the UK as in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. In general, the MHRA will not consider renewals to converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> before at least a minimal initiating sequence (as defined in section 5) and related documentation (the “data submission package”) has been received.  The date on which the minimal or full initiating sequence is received is referred to as “the data submission date”.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, we may consider a renewal (for either a converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> or converted conditional <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>) before the data submission date (in the absence of a minimal or fully initiating sequence) where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the renewal is necessary on urgent safety grounds</li>
  <li>the renewal is necessary in order to maintain supplies of a particular medicinal product to patients in Great Britain</li>
  <li>there are other necessary or beneficial reasons for considering the renewal in advance of receipt of the baseline information</li>
</ul>

<p>If the holder of a converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> considers that these conditions may apply, they should contact the agency’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-mhra#regulatory-information-service-ris">Regulatory Information Service</a> to ask for agreement from MHRA and to discuss how to proceed.</p>

<p>Renewal applications may be included with the data submission package as separate <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequences in line with the normal national <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> renewal process, but will only be considered after the baseline is processed.</p>

<p>After the data submission date, the normal renewal application process for national <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> and fees will apply.</p>

<h2>11. Approach to Renewals submitted to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> but not granted before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Where this applies, the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> must submit an application for renewal in accordance with the usual time limits, and the application should be submitted as a separate <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequence (sequence 0001 and so on) along with the initiating sequence (minimal or complete) if this has not already been submitted. The renewal will only be considered after the baseline is processed.</p>

<p>The MHRA will consider the application in accordance with new regulation 66B. No fee is due.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> will remain in force until the MHRA notifies the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> of its decision on the renewal application.</p>

<h2>13. General approach to Article 61(3) notifications for converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>In general, the MHRA will not consider Article 61(3) notifications for converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> before at least a minimal initiating sequence (as defined in section 5) and related documentation (the “data submission package”) has been received. In exceptional circumstances we may consider an Article 61(3) notification before the data submission date and in the absence of a minimal or full initiating sequence, if we are of the view that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the notification is necessary on urgent safety grounds</li>
  <li>the notification is necessary in order to maintain supplies of a particular medicinal product to patients in Great Britain or</li>
  <li>there are other necessary or beneficial reasons for considering the variation in advance of receipt of the baseline information.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the holder of a converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> considers that these conditions may apply, they should contact the agency’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-mhra#customer-services" class="govuk-link">Customer Service Centre</a> to ask for agreement from MHRA and discuss how to proceed.</p>

<p>Article 61(3) notifications may be included with the data submission package as separate <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> sequences in line with the normal national <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> notification process but will only be considered after the baseline is processed.</p>

<p>After the data submission date, the normal Article 61(3) process for national <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> and fees will apply.</p>

<h2>14. Approach to Article 61(3) notifications submitted to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> but not granted before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the holder of a converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> has made an Article 61(3) notification for the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> before 1 January 2021,</li>
  <li>the change is applicable to the product information intended for the UK market,</li>
  <li>the 90-day period referred to in Article 61(3) has not elapsed,</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> has not objected to the change,</li>
</ul>

<p>the notification must be included within the initiating sequence submission as if it had already been accepted in Great Britain. The change may be put in effect at the same time as for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>No fee will apply for these notifications.</p>

<p>The notification will be deemed to be accepted unless the holder of the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> is notified that it has been rejected within 30 days of the data submission date.</p>

<p>The details of the Article 61(3) notification must be included in the summary of historical regulatory activity submitted with the initiating sequence and the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> must notify the MHRA if the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> rejects the notification from 1 January 2021 but before the data submission date.</p>

<h2>15. Approach to Article 61(3) notifications made from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Where the holder of a converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> has made an Article 61(3) notification for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> from 1 January 2021 but before the data submission date, and the change is applicable to the product information intended for the Great Britain market, the notification must be included within the initiating sequence submission as if it had already been accepted in Great Britain. The change may be put in effect at the same time as for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>No fee will apply for these notifications.</p>

<p>The notification will be deemed to be accepted unless the holder of the converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> is notified that it has been rejected within 30 days of the data submission date.</p>

<h2>16. Legal presence requirement</h2>

<p>The marketing authorisation holder for a UK marketing authorisation (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>) must be established in the UK (Great Britain or Northern Ireland) or in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/EEA. A UK marketing authorisation is one that is granted by the UK Licensing Authority to permit the sale or supply of a product in Great Britain, Northern Ireland or in both territories.</p>

<p><abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> have the option if they intend to do a Change of Ownership application to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>include the <abbr title="Change of Ownership application">COA</abbr> in the initiating sequence as if it had already been approved by the MHRA and state in the cover letter that this option had been adopted or</li>
  <li>subsequently submit a Change of Ownership application (<abbr title="Change of Ownership application">COA</abbr>) after the submission of the baseline initiating sequence</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr>  must ask for PLGB numbers to be issued for the UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> by requesting them from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Capconversion@mhra.gov.uk">Capconversion@mhra.gov.uk</a> and use them in the <abbr title="electronic Application Form">eAF</abbr> and the initiating sequence. The initiating sequence must contain the current granted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> patient information and, additionally, mock-ups of the UK patient information should be included or text-only versions.</p>

<p>If text-only versions are provided, the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> will need to submit a subsequent variation to approve mock-ups of the UK patient information within 2 years from 1 January 2021 (by 1 January 2023).</p>

<p>The MHRA would prefer that <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> took the former approach and included the change in the initiating sequence. There will be no fee.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> who choose to submit a <abbr title="Change of Ownership application">COA</abbr> should see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medicines-marketing-authorisation-transfer-ownership">information on change of ownership published on our website</a>.</p>
