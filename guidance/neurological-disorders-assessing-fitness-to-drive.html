<h2>Serious neurological disorders</h2>

<p>Changes to Annex III to the EC Directive 2006/126/EC require that driving licences may not be issued to, or renewed for, applicants or drivers who have a serious neurological disorder unless there is medical support from their doctors.</p>

<p>A serious neurological disorder is considered as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any condition of the central or peripheral nervous system presently with, or at risk of progression to a condition with, functional (sensory (including special senses), motor and/or cognitive) effects likely to impact on safe driving</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information relating to specific functional criteria is provided on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>specific neurological conditions in this chapter (Neurology)</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/psychiatric-disorders-assessing-fitness-to-drive">cognitive and related conditions</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visual-disorders-assessing-fitness-to-drive">visual conditions and disorders</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/miscellaneous-conditions-assessing-fitness-to-drive#excessive-sleepiness--including-obstructive-sleep-apnoea-syndrome">excessive sleepiness</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When considering licensing for these customers, the functional status and risk of progression will be considered. A short term medical review licence is generally issued when there is a risk of progression.</p>

<h2>Epilepsy and seizures</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appendices-assessing-fitness-to-drive#appendix-b-epilepsy-and-seizure-rules-and-further-guidance">Appendix B</a> sets out the relevant regulations.</p>

<p>The following definitions apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>epilepsy encompasses all seizure types, including major, minor and auras</li>
  <li>if within a 24-hour period more than one epileptic event occurs, these are treated as a single event for the purpose of applying the epilepsy and seizure regulations</li>
  <li>from a licensing perspective, epilepsy means 2 or more unprovoked seizures over a period which exceeds 24 hours</li>
  <li>epilepsy is prescribed in legislation as a relevant disability where there have been 2 or more epileptic seizures during the previous 5 year period</li>
  <li>isolated seizure means one or more unprovoked seizures within a 24 hour period, or one or more unprovoked seizures within a 24 hour period where that period of seizure has occurred more than 5 years after the last unprovoked seizure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following features, in both Group 1 car and motorcycle and Group 2 bus and lorry drivers, are considered to indicate a good prognosis for a person under care for a first unprovoked or isolated epileptic seizure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no relevant structural abnormalities on brain imaging</li>
  <li>no definite epileptiform activity on EEG</li>
  <li>support of a neurologist</li>
  <li>annual risk of seizure considered to be 2% or lower for bus and lorry drivers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special considerations</h3>

<p>Here are the special considerations.</p>

<h4>Group 1 car and motorcycle</h4>

<p>The following special considerations apply to drivers of cars and motorcycles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The person with epilepsy may qualify for a driving licence if they have been free from any seizure for 1 year. This needs to include being free of minor seizures, including those that do not involve a loss of consciousness, and epilepsy signs such as limb jerking, auras and absences.</li>
  <li>The person who has had a seizure while asleep must stop driving for 1 year from the date of the seizure unless point 3 or 5 apply.</li>
  <li>Relicensing may be granted if the person, over the course of at least 1 year from the date of the sleep seizure, establishes a history or pattern of seizures occurring only ever while asleep.</li>
  <li>Relicensing may be granted if the person, over the course of at least 1 year from the date of the first seizure, establishes a history or pattern of seizures which affect neither consciousness nor cause any functional impairment. The person must never have experienced any other type of unprovoked seizure.</li>
  <li>Regardless of preceding seizure history, if a person establishes a pattern of asleep seizures only (all seizures had onset during sleep), starting at least 3 years prior to licence application and there have been no other unprovoked seizures during those 3 years, a licence may be issued.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overriding all of the above considerations is that the licence holder or applicant with epilepsy must not be regarded as a likely source of danger to the public while driving and that they are compliant with their treatment and follow up.</p>

<p>If the licensed driver has any epileptic seizure, they must stop driving immediately unless DVLA has established that considerations 3, 4 or 5 can be met, and they must notify DVLA.</p>

<p>If a licence is issued under considerations 3, 4 or 5 and the driver has a different type of seizure, they lose the concession, must stop driving, and must notify DVLA.</p>

<h4>Isolated seizures</h4>

<p>An isolated seizure is an unprovoked seizure experienced by a person who has not had any other unprovoked seizures during the preceding 5 years. A person who has an isolated seizure will qualify for a driving licence if they are free from any further seizure for 6 months, unless there are clinical factors or results of investigations suggesting an underlying causative factor that may increase the risk of a further seizure, in which case 12 months is required before relicensing.</p>

<h4>Withdrawal of epilepsy medication (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appendices-assessing-fitness-to-drive#appendix-b-epilepsy-regulations-and-further-guidance">also see Appendix B</a>)</h4>

<p>Individuals should not drive whilst anti-epilepsy medication is being withdrawn and for 6 months after the last dose.</p>

<p>For a driver with epilepsy, if a seizure occurs within 6 months of, and because of a documented physician-advised substitution, reduction or withdrawal of anti-epilepsy medication, the regulations allow relicensing prior to the usual 12 month post-seizure period. Earlier relicensing may be considered if previously effective medication has been reinstated for at least 6 months and the driver has remained seizure free for at least 6 months.</p>

<h4>Group 2 bus and lorry</h4>

<p>Drivers of buses and lorries must satisfy all of the following conditions under the regulations. They must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold a full ordinary driving licence</li>
  <li>have been free of epileptic seizures for the last 10 years</li>
  <li>not have taken any medication to treat epilepsy during these 10 years (there are thus no special considerations for withdrawal)</li>
  <li>have no continuing increased risk of epileptic seizures</li>
  <li>not be a source of danger whilst driving</li>
</ul>

<h4>Isolated seizure</h4>

<p>Drivers of buses and lorries must satisfy all of the following conditions in relation to an isolated seizure. They must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold a full ordinary driving licence</li>
  <li>have been free of epileptic attacks for the last 5 years</li>
  <li>not have taken any medication to treat epilepsy or a seizure during these 5 years</li>
  <li>have undergone a recent assessment by a neurologist</li>
  <li>have no continuing increased risk of seizures</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transient loss of consciousness (‘blackouts’) – or lost/altered awareness</h2>

<p>Transient loss of consciousness (TLoC) or ‘blackout’ is very common – it affects up to half the population in the UK at some point in their lives. An estimated 3% of A&amp;E presentations and 1% of hospital admissions are due to TLoC.</p>

<p>Road traffic collisions resulting from blackouts are two or three times more common than those resulting from seizures.</p>

<p>Recurrent TLoC (more than one isolated event), not including syncope, is uncommon – but always requires detailed medical assessment.</p>

<p>There are several causes of transient loss of consciousness:</p>

<ul>

</li>
  <li>Undetermined - see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/neurological-disorders-assessing-fitness-to-drive#transient-loss-of-consciousness--solitary-episode">syncope</a>

  <li>Medication - see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/miscellaneous-conditions-assessing-fitness-to-drive#medication-effects">medications</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to TLoC, 3 features are of note to medical practitioners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provocation</li>
  <li>posture</li>
  <li>prodrome</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to road safety, however, the 2 most important features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prodrome – are there warning symptoms sufficient in both nature and duration?</li>
  <li>posture – do the episodes of TLoC occur while sitting?</li>
</ul>

<p>A prodrome must allow time for a driver to find a safe place to stop before losing consciousness. A prodrome is reliable if the signs are clear, consistent across all events and provide sufficient duration to find a safe stop, or unreliable if these are absent.</p>

<p>Licence holders or applicants should be informed that they must notify DVLA when TLoC occurs while sitting.</p>

<p>For syncope occurring while standing or sitting, the following factors indicate high risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>abnormal ECG</li>
  <li>clinical evidence of structural heart disease</li>
</ul>

<p>Further investigations such as 48-hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography and exercise testing may be indicated after specialist opinion has been sought.</p>

<h3>Transient loss of consciousness – recurring episodes</h3>

<p>Recurrent episodes of TLoC are less common than isolated episodes but the relevance to increased risk in driving cannot be overemphasised.</p>

<p>Recurrent TLoC is most commonly due to recurrent syncope, occurring in around 20% to 30% of patients. Recurrence of syncope is usually within 3 years of the first episode, and in over 80% of these cases there has been at least one additional episode within 2 years of the first episode.</p>

<p>In relation to road safety however, the 2 most important features of temporary loss of consciousness are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prodrome – are there warning signs sufficient in both nature and duration?</li>
  <li>posture – do the episodes of TLoC occur while sitting?</li>
</ul>

<p>A prodrome must allow time for a driver to find a safe place to stop before losing consciousness. A prodrome is reliable if the signs are clear, consistent across all events and provide sufficient duration to find a safe stop, or unreliable if these are absent.</p>

<p>Recurrent pre-syncopal events should be treated (from a licensing point of view) in the same way as recurrent syncope, and should therefore be categorised according to the standards for recurrent syncope.</p>

<p>Licence holders or applicants should be informed that they must notify DVLA when transient loss of consciousness occurs while sitting.</p>

<h2>Cough syncope</h2>

<p>Having experienced an episode or episodes of cough syncope, a person has identified themselves as being in a higher risk group that is predisposed to cough syncope. Therefore, even if the cough syncope episode occurred during a short-lived period of increased cough (such as an episode of acute respiratory infection), this would not alter the fact that the person is then at a higher risk of experiencing an episode of cough syncope whenever they cough, regardless of the cause.</p>

<p>Treatment, management or resolution of the condition which caused the cough does not reduce the risk of syncope with further episodes of cough.</p>

<h2>Cavernous malformation</h2>

<p>Cavernomas are also known as cavernous malformations, cavernous angiomas, or cavernous haemangiomas. They are all surrounded by haemosiderin on brain MRI, but this does not necessarily imply that they have ‘bled’ in the past. The risk of events that might affect driving differs according to cavernoma location (brainstem vs. other locations) and symptoms attributable to the cavernoma (stroke vs. epileptic seizure vs. no symptoms).</p>

<p>A person’s age, the number of cavernomas, and the size of the cavernoma do not seem to affect these risks. With multiple cavernomas, licensing restrictions differ according to cavernoma location, symptoms, or treatment. The most restrictive guidance will apply.</p>
