<h2>What climate change allowances are</h2>

<p>Climate change allowances are predictions of the anticipated change for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>peak river flow</li>
  <li>peak rainfall intensity</li>
  <li>sea level rise</li>
  <li>offshore wind speed and extreme wave height</li>
</ul>

<p>They are based on UK climate change projections (<abbr title="UK climate change projections">UKCP</abbr>). There are different allowances for different epochs or periods of time over the coming century.
Climate change allowances support the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england--2">National <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> Strategy for England</a>.</p>

<h3>Appraising <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> projects, schemes and strategies</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency appraises projects, schemes and strategies that seek <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> <abbr title="grant-in-aid">GIA</abbr> funding. They use this guidance to compare projects, schemes and strategies in different locations. This ensures they allocate government funding where it provides the biggest benefit.</p>

<h3>Exceptions to using climate change allowances</h3>

<p>Sometimes, local evidence might support using other data or allowances. For example, the impact of climate change on peak river flow may not be the same in all river catchments in a river basin district. The Environment Agency may want to check how and why you used other data.</p>

<h2>Why you need to use climate change allowances</h2>

<p>Climate change allowances help you to understand how flood or coastal erosion risk may change over time. They enable you to develop projects, schemes and strategies that can adapt to a range of future climate change scenarios. We call this an adaptive approach. See section â€˜Adaptive approach to managing flood and coastal erosion riskâ€™ in this guide for more information.</p>

<h2>General approach to apply climate change allowances</h2>

<p>By applying this guidance, you will develop solutions that are more effective in the long-term and for a range of future climate change scenarios.</p>

<h3>Proportionate climate change allowance assessments</h3>

<p>This guidance provides an approach that will be appropriate to a wide range of projects, schemes and strategies. Application of this guidance should be proportionate to the scale of your project, scheme or strategy.</p>

<p>This may involve a broad assessment of climate impacts over the lifetime of the project, scheme or strategy. It could identify where you need to do more detailed analysis over interim time periods.</p>

<p>To minimise detailed analysis, group different options together that have common circumstances. 
Develop your approach based on the following 3 steps. You should apply the appropriate climate change allowances as set out in this guide. Your assessment should show how different climate change scenarios may affect the baseline option over time. This will help you understand the scale and consequences of the changing risks.</p>

<p>In the <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> appraisal the baseline is usually the â€˜do nothingâ€™ option. For information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>defining the baseline option - see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-appraisal-guidance/5-define-the-type-of-appraisal-project-and-set-the-project-baseline">section 7 of the <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> appraisal guidance</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the duration of your appraisal period - see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-appraisal-guidance/3-understand-and-define-the-appraisal-need">section 5 of the <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> appraisal guidance</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Apply the â€˜designâ€™ climate change allowances to each appraisal option</h3>

<p>The â€˜designâ€™ climate change allowances are set out in each of the â€˜which allowances to useâ€™ sections in this guide. Apply the design climate change allowances to each appraisal option. This will help you understand the effect on each design option over time.</p>

<p>If you want to achieve a particular standard of protection, youâ€™ll need to allow for suitable mitigation in your design. Youâ€™ll need to do this for each design option. This helps you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compare different options based on potential performance over time</li>
  <li>identify options with the greatest potential to meet your project objectives</li>
  <li>select your leading design options for further testing</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to develop your design options - see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-appraisal-guidance/6-develop-a-shortlist-of-options">section 8 of the <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> appraisal guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>identifying a leading option - see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-appraisal-guidance/8-compare-and-select-the-preferred-option">section 11 of the <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> appraisal guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Your design allowances must be based on the climate change allowances in this guide.</p>

<h3>2. Apply climate change allowances for severe climate change</h3>

<p>You should apply severe climate change allowances to your leading options. This will show how sensitive these options are to severe climate impacts. Work with your stakeholders to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the risk changes</li>
  <li>extra resilience or mitigation measures to cope with severe impacts</li>
</ul>

<p>Use climate change allowances over interim periods to help identify when to put these extra measures in place.
See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-appraisal-guidance/8-compare-and-select-the-preferred-option">section 11 of the <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> appraisal guidance</a> for information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to select your preferred option</li>
  <li>using sensitivity testing to support your recommendation</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the severe climate change allowances in this guide.</p>

<h3>3. Apply extreme climate change allowances to your recommended option</h3>

<p>This will show how your recommended option performs under extreme conditions. Share this information with stakeholders in the appraisal process to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show the impacts of extreme climate change</li>
  <li>help inform their planning to achieve community-wide resilience</li>
</ul>

<p>You must include the extreme scenario where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the scale of flooding or coastal erosion risk impacts are extreme</li>
  <li>management options involve very high value or low adaptability assets</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not usually need to include the extreme scenario in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the design of your recommended option</li>
  <li>your appraisalâ€™s economic and financial assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>If management options must involve very high value or low adaptability assets you should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when to put them in place</li>
  <li>their costs</li>
  <li>the benefits of extra measures to cope with the more extreme scenario</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transition arrangements</h2>

<h3>Peak rainfall intensity allowances</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transition-to-current-fcerm-appraisal-and-partnership-funding-guidance">transition deadlines</a> explain when you should use the new peak rainfall intensity allowances.</p>

<h3>Sea level rise, wind and wave allowances</h3>

<p>These allowances have not changed. Continue to use them as set out in this guide.</p>

<h2>Peak river flow allowances</h2>

<p>Peak river flow allowances show the anticipated changes to peak flow by management catchment. Management catchments are sub-catchments of river basin districts. The peak river flow allowances are for management catchments.</p>

<p>The allowances are based on percentiles from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index" rel="external"><abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> data</a>. A percentile is a measure used in statistics. They describe the proportion of possible scenarios that fall below an allowance level. The:</p>

<ul>
  <li>central allowance is based on the 50th percentile</li>
  <li>higher central allowance is based on the 70th percentile</li>
  <li>extreme allowance is based on the 95th percentile</li>
</ul>

<p>An allowance based on the 50th percentile is exceeded by 50% of the projections in the range. At the 70th percentile it is exceeded by 30%. At the 95th percentile it is exceeded by 5%.</p>

<h3>Which allowances to use for peak river flow</h3>

<p>To find out which allowances to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/climate-change-allowances" rel="external">climate change allowances for management catchments map</a>
</li>
  <li>search for your location - by postcode, national grid reference or town in the address search box</li>
  <li>select the management catchment for your location</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency also provide these allowances in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/peak-rainfall-climate-change-allowances-by-management-catchment">peak river flow climate change allowances by management catchment table</a>. You have to know your management catchment to get the information you need.</p>

<p>To manage river flooding in your project, scheme or strategy you should use the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>central allowance as your design allowance</li>
  <li>higher central allowance to test the impacts of higher scenarios of climate change and any extra mitigation</li>
  <li>extreme allowance to test your option under more extreme climate change and exceedance events</li>
  <li>2080s epoch allowances for changes beyond the 2080s epoch and up to 2115</li>
</ul>

<h4>Apply your allowances</h4>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow the general approach to apply climate change allowances section</li>
  <li>interpolate (adjust) the peak river flow allowance between the current year and 2030</li>
  <li>apply the peak river flow allowance to the hydrological estimate for the 2050s and 2080s</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 1 shows how the climate change allowances for peak river flows should be applied.</p>

<h4>Figure 1: application of peak river flow allowances</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="peak river flow allowances graph" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/135398/CC_Allowances_Graphic_AE_211112.svg"></div></figure>

<h3>Non-stationarity</h3>

<p>Hydrological estimates usually assume extreme flood events in the past are â€˜stationaryâ€™. This is where we assume past flood events can represent future flood events.</p>

<p>In some rivers, we can observe an increasing number of extreme flood events. This has prompted hydrologists to consider how peak river flows change over time. Hydrologists term this phenomenon as non-stationarity.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has published guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-research-reports/development-of-interim-national-guidance-on-non-stationary-fluvial-flood-frequency-estimation">non-stationary fluvial flood frequency estimation</a>. You should apply the methods in section 5.7 of the guidance if using non-stationary peak river flows. Where a river flow record is non-stationary, you may be able to adjust the peak river flow allowance in the 2020s. This would account for observed changes in peak river flows during the 2020s epoch (2015 to 2039).</p>

<h2>Peak rainfall intensity allowances</h2>

<p>Increased rainfall affects river levels and land and urban drainage systems. Peak rainfall intensity allowances show the anticipated changes to peak rainfall by management catchment. The allowances are based on percentiles from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/index" rel="external"><abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> data</a>. A percentile is a measure used in statistics. They describe the proportion of possible scenarios that fall below an allowance level. The:</p>

<ul>
  <li>central allowance is based on the 50th percentile</li>
  <li>upper end allowance is based on the 95th percentile</li>
</ul>

<p>An allowance based on the 50th percentile is exceeded by 50% of the projections in the range. At the 95th percentile it is exceeded by 5%.</p>

<h3>Which allowance to use for peak rainfall intensity</h3>

<p>To find out which allowances to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/climate-change-allowances" rel="external">climate change allowances for management catchments map</a> for management catchment map</li>
  <li>search for your location - by postcode, national grid reference or town in the address search box</li>
  <li>select the management catchment for your location</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency also provide these allowances in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/peak-rainfall-climate-change-allowances-by-management-catchment">climate change allowances by management catchment table</a>. You need to know your management catchment to get the information you need.
You should use the peak rainfall intensity ranges in the peak river flow and rainfall intensity allowances for management catchment map to assess and design projects, schemes and strategies in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>small catchments of less than 5km<sup>2</sup>
</li>
  <li>urban locations, for example inner city locations with lots of impermeable surfaces</li>
</ul>

<p>You should use the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>central allowance as your design allowance</li>
  <li>upper end allowance to test the sensitivity of your option to more severe climate change and extra mitigation</li>
</ul>

<p>For large rural river catchments over 5km<sup>2</sup> you should use the peak river flow allowances.</p>

<h4>Apply your allowances</h4>

<p>You should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-and-coastal-risk-projects-schemes-and-strategies-climate-change-allowances#general-approach">general approach to apply climate change allowances section</a>.</p>

<h2>Sea level allowances</h2>

<p><abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> provide projections of relative mean sea level rise around the whole UK coast. You can find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/marine-projections" rel="external">how the marine projections were developed</a> on the <abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> website.</p>

<p>You should use site specific sea level rise values from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> user interface</a>. The user interface provides a range of allowances based on percentiles.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18-guidance---representative-concentration-pathways.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> Representative Concentration Pathway (<abbr title="Representative Concentration Pathway">RCP</abbr>) 8.5</a> use the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>70th percentile (higher central) as the design allowance</li>
  <li>95th percentile (upper end) allowance in planning for more severe climate impacts</li>
</ul>

<p>An allowance based on the 70th percentile is exceeded by 30% of the projections in the range. At the 95th percentile it is exceeded by 5% of the projections in the range.</p>

<h3>Calculating sea level</h3>

<p>To calculate sea level, add together the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>climate change allowances from the <abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> user interface</li>
  <li>present day extreme sea levels from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/73834283-7dc4-488a-9583-a920072d9a9d/coastal-design-sea-levels-coastal-flood-boundary-extreme-sea-levels-2018" rel="external">Coastal design sea levels - coastal flood boundary extreme sea levels (2018)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Present day extreme sea levels account for the astronomical tide level and the surge.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> dataset projects to 2100. To calculate epochs up to 2125, use the average incremental increase from the last 5 years of the dataset â€“ 2094 to 2099 from <abbr title="Representative Concentration Pathway">RCP</abbr> 8.5.</p>

<p>To perform an extra assessment for the lifetime of the scheme after 2125, use the sea level rise projections to 2300 for <abbr title="Representative Concentration Pathway">RCP</abbr> 8.5. You can get sea level rise projections for the appropriate location and year from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ukclimateprojections-ui.metoffice.gov.uk/ui/home" rel="external"><abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> user interface</a>.</p>

<p>The data in table 1 is from the <abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> user interface. It is provided for illustrative purposes only. tIt presents change using RCP8.5 at the 70th and 95th percentile, based on a 1981 to 2000 baseline. You should use the climate change allowances from the interface in your assessment.</p>

<h3>Credible maximum (H++) allowances</h3>

<p>National credible maximum sea level rise estimates (also referred to H++) are provided for the UK. The Met Office has not produced new H++ allowances as part of <abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr>. They consider it is still appropriate to use the UKCP09 H++ allowances.</p>

<p>Where it is appropriate to apply H++ allowances you should use the allowance use a figure of 1.9 metres by 2100 (based on 1990 baseline). <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts">Contact the Environment Agency</a> if you need to consider plausible, high end scenarios for other time periods.</p>

<h3>Which allowance to use for coastal flooding</h3>

<p>To manage coastal flooding in your project, scheme or strategy you should use the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>higher central (70th percentile from <abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> <abbr title="Representative Concentration Pathway">RCP</abbr> 8.5) as your design allowance</li>
  <li>upper end allowance (95th percentile from <abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> <abbr title="Representative Concentration Pathway">RCP</abbr> 8.5) to test sensitivity to severe climate change and any required mitigation</li>
  <li>H++ to test your option under more extreme climate change and exceedance events</li>
</ul>

<h4>Apply your allowances</h4>

<p>You should follow the approach in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-and-coastal-risk-projects-schemes-and-strategies-climate-change-allowances#general-approach">general approach to apply climate change allowances section</a>.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency expects sea level rise to increase the rate of coastal erosion. Use the coastal erosion risk maps to plan for any changes in the position of the coastline. They show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the shoreline management plan policy for each stretch of coast</li>
  <li>erosion predictions where there is no policy to maintain defences</li>
</ul>

<p>The coastal flooding allowance may help inform your coastal erosion scenarios.</p>

<h2>Offshore wind speed and extreme wave height allowance</h2>

<p>Wave heights may change because of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increased water depths</li>
  <li>changes to the frequency, duration and severity of storms</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the appropriate allowance for wind speed and wave height in table 2 if they are not included in the coastal model. The allowances are not cumulative across the epochs. Use the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sensitivity test in addition to offshore wind speed</li>
  <li>extreme wave height allowances in assessments where the H++allowances apply</li>
</ul>

<h4>Table 2: offshore wind speed and extreme wave height allowance (based on a 1990 baseline)</h4>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Which allowance to use offshore wind speed and extreme wave height</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply the allowances as standard for any coastal hydraulic modelling of climate change impacts</li>
  <li>use the sensitivity test in addition to the allowances where flooding impacts could be extreme</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not apply the allowances or sensitivity tests across epochs on a cumulative basis.</p>

<h2>Storm surge</h2>

<p>Present day levels in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/73834283-7dc4-488a-9583-a920072d9a9d/coastal-design-sea-levels-coastal-flood-boundary-extreme-sea-levels-2018" rel="external">Coastal design sea levels - coastal flood boundary extreme sea levels (2018)</a> account for storm surge.</p>

<p>Most Environment Agency coastal models use these extreme sea levels. Check whether this is the case with the Environment Agency when you receive the model. New coastal modelling must use the coastal flood boundary extreme sea levels (2018) to account for storm surge. You should then apply the sea level allowance in this guide.</p>

<p>You should test your designs and plans against the H++ scenario where flooding impacts could be extreme. This is based on an assessment of the research in the <abbr title="UK climate change projections 2018">UKCP18</abbr> Marine Report (2018). A surge increase of +2mm per year should be applied for all annual exceedance probabilities. You should apply this from a baseline year of 2017 to align with extreme sea levels in the coastal flood boundary extreme sea levels (2018).</p>

<h3>Change to storm surge</h3>

<p>The H++ estimate is +2mm per year from 2017.</p>

<p>This ensures a rigorous assessment of current coastal extreme water levels. The assessment is done by using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/73834283-7dc4-488a-9583-a920072d9a9d/coastal-design-sea-levels-coastal-flood-boundary-extreme-sea-levels-2018" rel="external">Coastal design sea levels - coastal flood boundary extreme sea levels (2018)</a>.</p>

<h3>Wave period</h3>

<p>Increases in wave period are caused by changes in storm characteristics that drive swell conditions. No specific allowances are recommended as more research is needed in this area.</p>

<p>You should consider sensitivity testing increases to wave period where flooding impacts are extreme. If you need support on this please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts">contact the Environment Agency</a>.</p>

<h2>Adaptive approach to managing flood and coastal erosion risk</h2>

<p>An adaptive approach involves implementing planned actions when particular thresholds are triggered. This avoids over-engineering assets and provides flexibility to manage future climate change uncertainties. This is likely to be appropriate where the ongoing responsibility is assigned to an operating authority for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monitoring the change in risk and thresholds over time</li>
  <li>implementing the actions</li>
</ul>

<p>An adaptive approach may not always be possible or economically efficient. In these cases, it will be more appropriate to take a precautionary approach. This is where you pursue â€˜no regretsâ€™ or â€˜low regretâ€™ options. For example, a one-off option that uses an extreme allowance to mitigate future climate impacts.
Adaptive approaches help to make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>economically optimal investment decisions</li>
  <li>more flexible use of <abbr title="grant-in-aid">GIA</abbr> funding</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you can make decisions where and when they are most needed, rather than making them up front. It reduces the risk of making decisions that are inflexible to future climate change.</p>

<p>You need to justify your approach to managing climate change impacts in your <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> appraisal and any <abbr title="grant-in-aid">GIA</abbr> application.</p>

<p>Find more information about the adaptive approach in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-policy-statement">governmentâ€™s <abbr title="flood and coastal erosion risk management">FCERM</abbr> policy statement</a>.</p>
