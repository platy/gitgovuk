<h2>Your responsibilities as a mentor</h2>

<p>As a mentor, your role is to support your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> through their 2-year induction.
Your responsibilities will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working with your school to make sure your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> receives a high-quality induction</li>
  <li>meeting regularly with your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> to provide support and feedback</li>
  <li>providing or arranging mentoring and coaching around specific phases and subject areas</li>
  <li>taking prompt, appropriate action if your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> is having difficulties</li>
</ul>

<p>If your school chooses to work with a training provider, you’ll receive training on how to support <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Allocation of time for mentoring</h2>

<p>Your mentor sessions should be scheduled during teaching hours wherever possible, as schools receive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-and-eligibility-for-ecf-based-training#dfe-funding-for-ecf-based-training"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding to cover your time off timetable</a>.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, mentoring may take place outside of teaching hours but these sessions should always be scheduled within contracted time.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training is part of an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s induction</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s induction includes both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training, with support from you - their mentor</li>
  <li>regular progress reviews and 2 formal assessments of the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s performance against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Your school may offer an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> extra training and support in addition to their <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training, but not instead of their <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training.</p>

<h2>Mentors do not need to collect performance data</h2>

<p><abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training is not an assessment tool, so you do not have to collect data on your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s performance.</p>

<p>The mentor role is separate to assessment. Your focus is on supporting the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s professional development during their 2-year induction.</p>

<p>Your school’s headteacher and induction tutor will be responsible for assessing <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a>. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-early-career-teachers-ects-ecf-based-training">guidance for <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr></a> explains what evidence they may be asked for to demonstrate their performance against those standards.</p>

<p>You can read more about how <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> are assessed in section 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england">statutory guidance on <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> induction</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> cannot fail their <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h2>

<p><abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training is a professional development programme. It is designed to help your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> develop their teaching knowledge, skills and working habits.</p>

<p><abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> should participate in their <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training as fully as possible, but failing to complete it will not mean they fail their induction.</p>

<p><abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training is separate from the formal assessment of an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s performance against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a>.</p>

<h2>Observing teaching as part of <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h2>

<p>If your school uses a training provider, you may be asked to carry out observations as part of <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training.</p>

<p>These observations are for the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s professional development and should not be used for assessment purposes.</p>

<p>Separate observation requirements apply to formal assessment. You can read about how <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> are assessed in section 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england">statutory guidance on <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> induction</a>.</p>

<h2>If your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> has concerns or difficulties</h2>

<p>Your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> should speak to their induction tutor if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they’re struggling to engage with their training</li>
  <li>they have any concerns about their induction or statutory entitlements (time off timetable or mentor support)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the school induction tutor cannot help them, your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> can speak to their appropriate body. They’re responsible for making sure <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> receive their statutory entitlements, and are fairly and consistently assessed. Your school should provide them with contact details for the right person to speak to.</p>

<h2>If you have concerns about mentoring</h2>

<p>Contact your school induction tutor if you have concerns about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your time off timetable</li>
  <li>your entitlements, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england">statutory guidance on <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> induction</a>
</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>’s training or progress</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> pauses or withdraws from their induction</h2>

<p>If your school uses a training provider and you are part-way through your 2-year mentor training, you can continue training so that you’re ready to work with other <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>.</p>
