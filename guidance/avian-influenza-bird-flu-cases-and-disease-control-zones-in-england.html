<h2>Avian Influenza Prevention Zone</h2>

<p>An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) including housing measures is in force across the UK. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#AIPZ">avian influenza guidance</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Cases and disease control zones</h2>

<p>The government has confirmed 86 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in England.</p>

<p>There were also 2 cases of avian influenza in Wales where a small area of the disease control zones around the premises extended into England. One of these zones is still in place and one has been revoked.</p>

<p>In addition there were 2 cases of avian influenza in Scotland where a small area of the surveillance zone surrounding each case extended into England, both of these zones have been revoked.</p>

<h2>Licences</h2>

<p>In disease control zones, certain movements of poultry, other captive birds, eggs, poultry products or materials associated with their keeping, or mammals from or to premises where poultry or other captive birds are kept, are not permitted. This is to control further disease spread.</p>

<p>Some low risk activities or movements are possible, provided that all conditions of the general licence are met by the person responsible. If it is not possible to meet the conditions, or if the activity or movement is not covered by a general licence, you can apply for a specific license.</p>

<p>Check if you are in a zone on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://defra.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8cb1883eda5547c6b91b5d5e6aeba90d" rel="external">interactive map</a>.</p>

<p>You can apply for licences for some low risk movements from any Protection Zone or Surveillance Zones currently in force.</p>

<p>Licences for the movement within or from the Captive Bird (Monitoring) Controlled Zones currently in force are not required.</p>

<h3>Specific licences</h3>

<p>Specific licences cover a movement or activity in a disease control zone when not covered by a general licence (see below). A specific licence will normally allow a one-off movement and will be subject to strict  conditions based on disease control risk.</p>

<p>To apply for a specific licence, use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-exemption-from-avian-influenza-disease-control-restrictions">Avian Influenza Licensing Service (AILS)</a> to submit your application online.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the service, contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:outbreak.licensing@apha.gov.uk">outbreak.licensing@apha.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You should submit your application as far in advance of the requested move as possible. It should be fully completed and include details of your premises registration.</p>

<p>You must register your birds with APHA before applying for a licence. Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/poultry-registration">register your birds</a>.</p>

<p>You must allow at least 5 days for the processing of your licence application. Complex and high-risk movements will need extra time to process. You must make contingency plans to allow for this, and consider what steps you will need to take if the licence cannot be issued in time.</p>

<p>The activity or movement for which you require a licence must not take place until a licence is issued and must be completed within the validity of the licence.</p>

<p>Licences may be reviewed and revoked if area or premises restrictions change.</p>

<h3>General licences</h3>

<p>General licences allow a movement or activity that would otherwise be prohibited in a disease control zone. You need to check that you meet and comply with the conditions of the general licence. If you do, you do not need to apply for a specific licence. You can rely on the general licence as providing authority for the movement or activity.</p>

<p>General licences are not applicable for the movement of any thing to or from premises which have been served a restriction notice by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).</p>

<p>The following general licences are available in Great Britain:</p>

</ul>

<p>General licences are available for food business operators in England – see the meat from poultry within the Protection Zone section below.</p>

<p>No other general licences have currently been issued for this outbreak.</p>

<h3>Meat from poultry within a Protection Zone in England and Wales</h3>

<p>To reduce animal health risks, food business operators have to follow specific rules for any meat produced from poultry or farmed game birds originating within a Protection Zone. Other poultry meat (from poultry not originating within the Protection Zone) is unaffected.</p>

<p>Meat produced from poultry or farmed game birds originating within a Protection Zone can be moved or sold, subject to several conditions. These include a requirement that the health mark is replaced with a specific mark which must remain with it throughout any processing or repackaging. These conditions are set out in General Licence EXD249(HPAI)(EW).</p>

<p>Under some specific circumstances – set out in General Licence EXD 264(HPAI)(EW) – the recipient of poultry meat is permitted to remove the specific mark temporarily for production, and in some circumstance not to re-apply it.</p>

<p>The legal requirements are set out in each general licence.</p>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p>Avian influenza controls are enforced by Local Authorities Animal Health Function (LAAHF), which is normally situated with the Trading Standards or Environmental Health Service of a local authority. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-trading-standards-office">postcode tool</a> to find details of how to contact your LAAHF with any reports of non-compliance.</p>

<h2>Older cases of avian influenza</h2>

<p>A total of 26 cases of avian influenza (2 LPAI and 24 HPAI) were confirmed in poultry and captive birds in the UK between November 2020 and March 2021, with 21 of the cases in GB. Several strains of HPAI virus were also found in wild birds in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p>We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reports-relating-to-recent-cases-of-avian-influenza-bird-flu">epidemiological reports</a> setting out our investigations into both the HPAI and LPAI cases in Great Britain,</p>

<p>A case of low pathogenic avian influenza (H5N3) was <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/avian-influenza-bird-flu-identified-in-suffolk">confirmed at a commercial chicken farm in Mid Suffolk</a> was confirmed on 10 December 2019. We published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reports-relating-to-recent-cases-of-avian-influenza-bird-flu">epidemiological report summarising our investigations into the case</a>.</p>

<p>The H5N6 strain of avian influenza was confirmed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-in-wild-birds">21 wild birds</a> between January and June 2018. There were no cases in poultry.</p>

<p>A number of cases of avian influenza were confirmed between December 2016 and June 2017. The H5N8 strain of avian influenza was confirmed at farms in Suffolk, Lancashire and Lincolnshire, and in backyard flocks in Lancashire, Norfolk, North Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Carmarthenshire. Full details of these cases are now available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20170606013112/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#movement-controls-and-licences" rel="external">on the National Archives website</a>. The same strain of the virus was also found in wild birds in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p>We have published two reports setting out our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reports-relating-to-recent-cases-of-avian-influenza-bird-flu">investigations into these cases</a>, covering December 2016 to March 2017, and April to May 2017 - these are known as epidemiological reports.</p>

<p>A case of low severity (H5N1) avian influenza was confirmed by the Scottish authorities on a poultry breeding farm in Dunfermline in January 2016. We published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-in-dunfermline-2016-epidemiology-report">epidemiological report summarising our investigations into the case</a>.</p>

<p>A case of H7N7 avian influenza was confirmed near Preston, Lancashire in July 2015. A low severity case of H7N7 was confirmed in February 2015 in chickens at a farm in Hampshire. A case of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 was confirmed in November 2014 in ducks on premises in East Yorkshire. We have published reports about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reports-relating-to-recent-cases-of-avian-influenza-bird-flu">investigations we carried out</a>. Earlier papers about these cases are available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20151229163149/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu" rel="external">National Archives website</a>.</p>
