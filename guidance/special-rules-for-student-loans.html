<h2>Plan and loan types and thresholds</h2>

<p>With effect from April 2022, the thresholds for making student loan deductions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plan 1 — £20,195 annually (£1,682.91 a month or £388.36 a week)</li>
  <li>Plan 2 — £27,295 annually (£2,274.58 a month or £524.90 a week)</li>
  <li>Plan 4 — £25,375 annually (£2,114.58 a month or £487.98 a week)</li>
</ul>

<p>Employees repay 9% of the amount they earn over the threshold for Plan 1, 2 and 4.</p>

<p>Postgraduate loans (<abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr>) — £21,000 (£1,750 a month or £403.84 a week)</p>

<p>Employees repay 6% of the amount they earn over the threshold for <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Starting student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions, checking plan and loan type</h2>

<p>You should work out the correct figure of employee earnings on which student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions are due. Use the same gross pay amount that you would use to work out your employer’s secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>Your employee may be liable to repay a <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> at the same time as a Plan 1, Plan 2 or Plan 4. Start making student loan and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions from the next available payday using the correct plan or loan type or both.</p>

<p>You will need to include these on your Full Payment Submission if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your new employee’s P45 shows deductions should continue — ask your employee to confirm their plan or loan type, or both</li>
  <li>your new employee tells you they’re repaying a student loan — ask your employee to confirm their plan or loan type, or both</li>
  <li>your new employee fills in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-starter-checklist">starter checklist</a> showing they have a student loan and or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> — the checklist should tell you which plan or loan type, or both to use</li>
  <li>HMRC sends you form <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> ‘Start Notice’ — this will tell you which plan type to use</li>
  <li>HMRC sends you form PGL1 ‘Start Notice’ — this will tell you they have a <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you receive a Generic Notification Service student loan and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> reminder — ask your employee to confirm their plan or loan type, or both</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re operating off-payroll you are not responsible for deducting student or postgraduate loan repayments for workers engaged through their own companies. The worker will account for student loan obligations in their own tax return.</p>

<p>Follow the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/off-payroll-working-in-the-public-sector-reform-for-fee-payers">Off-payroll working</a>.</p>

<p>If your employee does not know which plan or loan type they’re on, ask them to go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan">Repaying your student loan</a>. If they cannot tell you, use Plan 1 in your payroll software until you get a student loan start notice (<abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr>). Where the employee is on more than one plan, start deductions for the plan with the lowest recovery threshold until you get an <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rates-and-thresholds-for-employers-2021-to-2022">Check the student loan recovery thresholds</a>.</p>

<p>If you receive a form <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> or PGL1 ‘Start Notice’ for someone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have never employed,  phone the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/employer-enquiries">Employer Helpline</a>, HMRC will investigate and contact you again if necessary, file away the <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> or PGL1 ‘Start Notice’</li>
  <li>who claims never to have had a student loan, start making deductions in line with the Start Notice and continue doing so unless HMRC tells you otherwise, then file away the <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> or PGL1 ‘Start Notice’</li>
  <li>for whom you’re already making deductions you should:
    <ul>
      <li>check the plan type on the <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> ‘Start Notice’ you have just received</li>
      <li>update your payroll software and start making deductions using the new plan type at the next available pay 
day if this is different to the one you are currently using</li>
      <li>check the details on the PGL1 and update your payroll software if needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your employee thinks they have overpaid their deductions they should contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-slc-repayment-enquiries">Student Loan Company (<abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>) — repayment enquiries</a>.</p>

<p>If you receive an employee’s P45 after they have started to work for you, and they did not tell you, or indicate on their starter information they were a student loan borrower, or there is a gap since their last employment, you should ask them to confirm their plan or loan type.</p>

<p>You should start making deductions from the next payday.</p>

<p>If your employee does not know their plan or loan type they should go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/when-you-start-and-finish-repaying">Repaying your student loan</a>.</p>

<p>Do not make any deductions in arrears.</p>

<p>Where a new employee fills in an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-expat-starter-checklist">expat starter checklist</a> or indicates on the starter declaration checklist which specifies student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions apply, you should start making these deductions from the next payday.</p>

<p>You should only use an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-expat-starter-checklist">expat starter checklist</a> where employees have been seconded to work in the UK whilst remaining employed by an overseas employer. Find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwg2-further-guide-to-paye-and-national-insurance-contributions">guide to PAYE and National Insurance contributions</a>.</p>

<h2>Generic Notification Service (<abbr title="Generic Notification System">GNS</abbr>) messages</h2>

<p>HMRC will send 4 types of student loan or postgraduate loan <abbr title="Generic Notification System">GNS</abbr> reminders.</p>

<p>One is a reminder to start deductions where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you submit a Full Payment Submission (<abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr>) for an employee who has a student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deduction due</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr> shows a figure of nil</li>
</ul>

<p>This <abbr title="Generic Notification System">GNS</abbr> reminder is confirmation that HMRC has sent or is in the process of sending you an <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> or PGL1 ‘Start Notice’ for the employees shown.</p>

<p>The second is a reminder to make deductions using the correct plan type where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you submit an <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr> for an employee and have selected the plan type from the drop-down box on your payroll software</li>
  <li>the plan type declared on the <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr> does not match what HMRC holds for that employee</li>
</ul>

<p>For each employee shown on the reminder, you should start making the correct deductions from the first available pay day. You should look at the <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> or PGL1 ‘Start Notice’ or completed starter checklist for details of the correct student loan plan and loan type to use. If you do not have either of these, ask your employee the starter checklist questions. This will allow you to start deductions using the correct plan and loan type.</p>

<p>If you’re paying an occupational pension rather than a salary, you should ignore any student loan <abbr title="Generic Notification System">GNS</abbr> message.</p>

<p>The third <abbr title="Generic Notification System">GNS</abbr> message, introduced from September 2019, is a reminder to stop student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions for an employee from the next available pay date.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Generic Notification System">GNS</abbr> reminder is confirmation that HMRC has sent or is in the process of sending you an <abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr> or PGL2 ‘Stop Notice’ for the employees shown. This <abbr title="Generic Notification System">GNS</abbr> message and the <abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr> or PGL2 ‘Stop Notice’ will tell you the correct loan or plan type to stop taking deductions from. If you do not have either of these you can ask your employee.</p>

<p>The fourth <abbr title="Generic Notification System">GNS</abbr> message, introduced from April 2020, is a reminder not to deduct Student Loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions for an employee who is subject to the off-payroll working rules or only has an occupational pension rather than a salary.</p>

<p>These employees are not liable for Student Loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions and you must stop taking these deductions from the next available pay date.</p>

<p>For occupational pensions, refund any Student Loan and or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions you have made within the current tax year to your employee.</p>

<p>For employments subject to the off-payroll working rules from April 2020, only refund the Student Loan and or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions taken from payments subject to the off-payroll working rules only.</p>

<p>You will receive these reminders as <abbr title="Generic Notification System">GNS</abbr> messages to your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-online-log-in">Online PAYE account</a>. HMRC recommends that you register for email alerts for these reminders and may contact you to make sure the correct deductions begin.</p>

<h2>Stopping student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions</h2>

<p>Stop making student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you receive an <abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr> or PGL2 ‘Stop Notice’ from HMRC</li>
  <li>in exceptional circumstances, HMRC may ask you to stop making deductions — if this is the case they’ll tell you in writing or by phone and then confirm in writing</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr> or PGL2 ‘Stop Notice’ received</h2>

<p>Stop making deductions from the first available payday after the deduction stop date shown on the notice. The ‘first available payday’ is the first payday on which it’s practical to apply that notice.</p>

<p>If the borrower is still employed by you and you use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/basic-paye-tools">Basic PAYE Tools</a> for this employee edit the employee details in the employer database. You can do this by removing the student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> borrower indicator and keep the <abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr>, or PGL2 ‘Stop Notice.’</p>

<p>If the borrower is no longer employed by you and you have not submitted leaver details to HMRC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leave the box headed ‘Enter ‘Y’ if student loan deduction is to be made’ blank</li>
  <li>submit leaver information in Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) and provide employee with P45 parts 1A, 2 and 3</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have submitted leaver details you should keep the <abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr> or PGL2  ‘Stop Notice’.</p>

<p>You cannot stop making deductions because your employee asks you to. Your employee should contact the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> if they think they have overpaid their loan.</p>

<h2>Employee dies</h2>

<p>Do not make any deductions from any payments made after an employee dies as these payments are not subject to Class 1 National Insurance contributions. This applies even though the payment may relate to a period prior to death, for example, unpaid wages.</p>

<h2>Employee leaves</h2>

<p>If you make a payment to a borrower who is no longer your employee, calculate the student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions on the same amount, and for the same earnings period as for employer’s secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>When an employee leaves, check if you’re making student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions.</p>

<p>If you have received:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> or PGL1 ‘Start Notice’ with a start date in the current or a previous tax year</li>
  <li>a P45 with a ‘Y’ in box 5</li>
  <li>starter information indicating student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions apply</li>
</ul>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fill in P45 with ‘Y’ in box 5 indicating student loan deductions should continue</li>
  <li>send leaver information to HMRC in <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> and give your employee P45 parts 1A, 2 and 3</li>
  <li>enter ‘Y’ on P45 box 5 even if your employee has not earned enough to make student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> repayments</li>
</ul>

<p>If you receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>form <abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr> or PGL2 ‘Stop Notice’</li>
  <li>written instructions from HMRC to stop making deductions</li>
  <li>form <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> or PGL1 ‘Start Notice’ with a start date which is after they leave your employment</li>
</ul>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fill in P45 leaving box 5 blank</li>
  <li>send leaver information to HMRC in <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> and give your employee P45 parts 1A, 2 and 3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employee has more than one job</h2>

<p>If an employee has more than one job you should ignore earnings from the other employer.</p>

<p>If the employee has more than one job with you follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/what-to-do-if-your-employee-has-more-than-1-job">aggregate rules</a> if they apply. Otherwise treat both employments separately.</p>

<h2>Change of pay interval</h2>

<p>If the interval between the payments of an employee’s earnings changes, for example, from weekly to monthly, you need to adjust the deductions for the new earnings period.</p>

<p>Work out the student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deduction from the first payment after the change based on the new earnings period. This may mean you include details of pay and deductions already included in the last pay period before the change.</p>

<p>If you have included a payment already made in the first of the new longer periods, you should take the payment already made, and the deduction worked out on it, into account when working out the student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deduction for the new period as a whole.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>You pay an employee repaying on Plan 1 £500 weekly. The pay interval changes to monthly in the third week of the month. The monthly pay is £2,000. The £2,000 payment in week 4 is made up of the two £500 payments made in weeks 1 and 2 plus £1,000 for weeks 3 and 4.</p>

<p>You can find more information on what to do if the interval between the payment of an employee’s earnings changes in Chapter 1 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cwg2-further-guide-to-paye-and-national-insurance-contributions">guide to PAYE and National Insurance contributions</a>.</p>

<p>The guidance given for National Insurance contributions purposes also applies to student loan deductions.</p>

<h2>Errors deducting student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> repayments</h2>

<p>Follow this process unless you have received an <abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr> or PGL2 ‘Stop Notice’. If you’ve received a <abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr> or PGL2 ‘Stop Notice’ you must not make any refund. Instead, your employee should contact the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Current tax year</h3>

<p>If you have made an over deduction and you can repay it to the borrower during the current tax year you should do so, amending your Year-To-Date payroll records.</p>

<p>If you cannot repay it phone the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/employer-enquiries">Employer Helpline</a>.</p>

<p>If there’s been an under-deduction and you can collect it from the borrower in the current tax year you should do so. Correct your Year-To-Date payroll records to reflect what was actually deducted.</p>

<p>If you cannot collect it phone the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/employer-enquiries">Employer Helpline</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>During each period you can only collect an additional amount less than, or equal to, the amount that is due to be deducted in that period.</p>
</div>

</table>

<p>(*that is, £15 week 9 deduction + £15 under-deduction) <br></p>

<p>You may recover the remaining £10 under-deduction in later pay periods following the above rules.</p>

<h3>Previous tax year</h3>

<p>If you have submitted your final <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr> for that year you do not need to take any further action.
If asked, you should tell your employee to contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/student-loans-company"><abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If you have not submitted your final <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr> for that year for any over-deductions you can repay the employee and amend your records so the final <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr> reflects the correct amounts. For under-deductions you do not need to take any further action. Further deductions will cover repayment of the balance of the loan.</p>

<h2>Variable interest rates</h2>

<p>From April 2017, <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> set interest rates for Plan 2 loans based on an individual’s income. The <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr> you make gives this income information, and HMRC passes it to <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>. There is no action for you to take but some employees may ask you to check and confirm the information you have sent to HMRC.</p>

<h2>Sharing PAYE information with <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>: more frequent data sharing</h2>

<p>From April 2019, HMRC started to send the student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> repayment information reported on your <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> more frequently throughout the tax year. Known as ‘more frequent data sharing’, this means that there will be regular updates on your employee’s student loan and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> balance. There is no action for you to take but some employees may ask you to check and confirm the information you have sent to HMRC.</p>

<h2>Employees working abroad</h2>

<h3>Employee paid from the UK</h3>

<p>If you’re operating PAYE as though the employee were in the UK continue to make student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions no matter how long they’re working abroad.</p>

<h3>Employee paid locally abroad</h3>

<p>If you pay a borrower abroad they must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-slc-repayment-enquiries">contact the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr></a> to have a repayment schedule set up.</p>

<h2>Court orders and how they affect student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions</h2>

<p>In addition to student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions, you may have to consider a court order such as an Attachment of Earnings Order (<abbr title="Attachment of Earnings Order">AEO</abbr>) or Deductions from Earnings Order (<abbr title="Deduction of Earnings Order">DEO</abbr>).</p>

<p>The order and amount of student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions depends on whether the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Attachment of Earnings Order">AEO</abbr>, <abbr title="Deduction of Earnings Order">DEO</abbr> is a priority or non-priority order</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Attachment of Earnings Order">AEO</abbr>, <abbr title="Deduction of Earnings Order">DEO</abbr> is  based on specific or percentage amounts</li>
  <li>total deductions including student and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions means your employees pay is less than the protected earnings level specified in the court order</li>
</ul>

<h3>Order of deduction in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</h3>

<h4>Priority order — percentage based</h4>

<p>Some priority orders — Council tax or Community Charge <abbr title="Attachment of Earnings Orders">AEOs</abbr> or Income Support Deduction notices — are percentage deductions.</p>

<p>Do not deduct any student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> repayments until all such orders are paid in full.</p>

<p><abbr title="Attachment of Earnings Orders">AEOs</abbr> issued by Magistrates’ Courts under The Courts Act 2003 Regulations are percentage based. You should still treat these as ‘Priority order — specific amounts’ and calculate the student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deduction as normal.</p>

<h4>Priority order — specified and non-specified amounts</h4>

<p>If there is no specified level of protected earnings:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Apply the priority order against the borrower’s attachable earnings before making student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions.</li>
  <li>Calculate the student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions using payroll software or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sl3-student-loan-deduction-tables">SL3 student loan deduction tables</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If there is a specified level of protected earnings:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Apply the priority order against the borrower’s attachable earnings before making student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions.</li>
  <li>Calculate the <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> and student loan deductions with <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions taking priority before Student Loan deductions.</li>
  <li>Check the deduction of court orders, <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> or student loan deduction does not reduce the available income below the level of protected earnings.</li>
</ol>

<p>Where the deduction of court orders, <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> and student loan reduces the available income below the level of protected earnings, the maximum amount of student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions is the difference between the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the net attachable earnings after deduction of the <abbr title="Attachment of Earnings Order">AEO</abbr>, <abbr title="Deduction of Earnings Order">DEO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the level of protected earnings rounded down to the nearest pound, if negative, set to zero</li>
</ul>

<h4>Non-priority orders</h4>

<p>Take away student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions before non-priority court orders.</p>

<h2>Order of deduction in Scotland</h2>

<h3>Scottish court order</h3>

<p>Do not make any student and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> loan deductions if you’re required to apply any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an Earnings Arrestment</li>
  <li>a current Maintenance Arrestment</li>
  <li>a Conjoined Arrestment Order</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deduction of Earnings Order</h3>

<p>Make student and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions after the <abbr title="Deduction of Earnings Order">DEO</abbr>, which is a priority order, but the employee’s pay must not fall below the protected earnings level.</p>

<h3>Scottish court orders and <abbr title="Deduction of Earnings Orders">DEOs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Do not make any student and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions if you have a <abbr title="Deduction of Earnings Order">DEO</abbr> and a Scottish court order to apply.</p>

<h3>Scottish Debt Arrangement Scheme (<abbr title="Debt Arrangement Scheme">DAS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Collection of student and, or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions is not affected by instructions to make deductions under the <abbr title="Debt Arrangement Scheme">DAS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Repayment of teachers’ loan scheme</h2>

<p>This scheme is no longer available.</p>

<h2>Record keeping</h2>

<p>You should keep records of all wages, and other documents relating to the calculation and deduction of student loan or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> repayments, including forms <abbr title="Start Notice">SL1</abbr> and PGL1 ‘Start Notice’ and <abbr title="Stop Notice">SL2</abbr> and PGL2 ‘Stop Notice’, for a period of at least 3 years after the end of the tax year to which they relate.</p>

<p>Enter the amount of student loan and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions in the appropriate box on your employee’s <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr>, and P60 (whole pounds only).</p>
