<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Italy to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings.</p>

<p>These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>The Italian authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en" rel="external">Italian government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Italy. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en" rel="external">Italian government</a>, or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Italy, so you know which ones to use when speaking to the Italian authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You do not need a permit or visa if you’re travelling to Italy for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>going to court as a witness</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs</li>
  <li>board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>fact-finding visits</li>
  <li>negotiating, signing and executing deals or contracts</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference if you aren’t being paid</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
  <li>installing, upgrading and troubleshooting software or machinery where there’s an after-sales contract in place</li>
  <li>taking part in technical training</li>
  <li>consulting</li>
  <li>completing an after-sales service</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays, or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>Or for the following types of training, as long as it’s for the same company or group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving and providing classroom-based training</li>
  <li>shadowing someone’s job</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Italy’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>You may not need a visa or permit in Italy if you have an EU intra company transfer (EU ICT) from another country. With this you can work in Italy for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en" rel="external">Check if you need a visa or permit</a>.</p>

<h3>Declare your arrival</h3>

<p>You must make a ‘declaration of presence’ (dichiarazione di presenza) to Italy’s immigration authorities even if you don’t need a visa or permit.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling to Italy from outside the Schengen area you do this by getting your passport stamped at the border.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling to Italy from another <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen country</a> you need to make a declaration within 8 days of arriving by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>signing a declaration form and giving it to the hotel management, if you’re staying at a hotel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>filing a declaration at the police station, if you’re staying in private accommodation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Italian embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa and permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with the Italian <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<p>Usually, you need to apply for a D visa first so you can start working. You then apply for a longer-term residence permit when you’re in Italy. If employed, your employer often has to start the application process.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>You may be able to apply for dependant permits if you have a family and want them to join you. It depends on the type of work permit you have.
Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://integrazionemigranti.gov.it/en-gb/Ricerca-norme/Dettaglio-norma/id/7/Family-reunificatione" rel="external">taking your family with you</a>.</p>

<h3>Long-term visas and permits</h3>

<p>You need to apply for a long-term visa and permit if you’re in Italy because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring to the Italian branch of a UK-based company</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing services to a client in Italy</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for an Italian company on an Italian employment contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#startup">setting up an innovative startup</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#investing">investing in Italy</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research work</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Transferring to an Italian branch of a UK-based company</h2>
<p>You need one of these work permits If your UK employer is transferring you to a branch in Italy:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#eu-ict">EU intra company transfer permit (EU ICT), for managers and specialists transferring for up to 3 years, or 1 year for trainees</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ict">intra-company transfer permit (ICT), for managers and specialists transferring for up to 5 years</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>EU intra company transfer (EU ICT)</h3>
<p>You need an intra-company transfer permit (ICT) if your UK-based company moves you to a branch in Italy to work for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 3 years</li>
  <li>1 year if you’re a trainee</li>
</ul>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have worked for your UK employer for at least 3 months</li>
  <li>be a manager, specialist or trainee</li>
  <li>have specialist knowledge in the field</li>
  <li>have a bachelor’s level degree or at least 3 years’ relevant work experience</li>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract</li>
  <li>stay on UK payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>An EU ICT can take 2 to 3 months to get. You can’t extend it beyond the 3 years, or 1 year for trainees.
If you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://integrazionemigranti.gov.it/en-gb/Ricerca-norme/Dettaglio-norma/id/7/Family-reunificatione" rel="external">family they can join you</a> with this permit type.</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>You need to check with the Italian authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Your employer applies for your work permit at the Italian immigration office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.esteri.it/mae/servizi/stranieri/formulario_visto_nazionale.pdf" rel="external">apply for a D visa</a> at the Italian consulate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You sign a ‘contract of stay’ (contratto di soggiorno) at the local immigration office within 8 days of arriving in Italy and are given an Italian tax code. If applying for a year or more you also need to sign an integration agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You apply for a residence permit at the local post office in Italy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You visit the local police station to provide your fingerprints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You collect your residence permit from the local police station once issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You register your address at the local town hall.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Application documents</h4>

<p>Italian authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed visa application form</li>
  <li>passport for you and any dependants, valid for 3 months after the requested end date of the visa, with at least 2 blank pages</li>
  <li>marriage certificate, if married</li>
  <li>birth certificates of any children</li>
  <li>evidence of termination of any previous marriages</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation, owned or rented, with a signed contract</li>
  <li>degree or qualification certificate</li>
  <li>signed assignment agreement with your UK employer</li>
  <li>copy of passport for the Italian company’s legal representative</li>
  <li>copy of passport for the UK employer’s legal representative</li>
  <li>official document showing the relationship between your UK employer and the Italian company, such as an annual report</li>
  <li>recent annual tax return for the Italian company</li>
  <li>proof that the Italian company has paid social security (DM10 and F24 forms)</li>
  <li>Chamber of Commerce certificate for the Italian company</li>
  <li>proof of the Italian company’s registration with the Italian Workers Compensation Authority (INAIL) and the Italian social security authority (INPS)</li>
  <li>annual financial statement for the UK company</li>
  <li>social security cover certificate or confirmation that the Italian company will comply with Italian social security regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>Any documents issued outside of Italy must be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">legalised (apostilled)</a>.</p>

<p>They must be in Italian. Translations need to be legalised by the Italian consulate.</p>

<h3>Intra-company transfer (ICT)</h3>
<p>You need an intra-company transfer permit (ICT) if your UK-based company moves you to a branch in Italy to work for up to 5 years.</p>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have worked in the same industry for at least 6 months</li>
  <li>be a manager or specialist</li>
  <li>have specialist knowledge in the relevant field</li>
  <li>have a bachelor’s level degree or at least 3 years’ relevant work experience</li>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract</li>
  <li>stay on UK payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>An ICT can take 3 to 6 months to get. It’s valid for up to 2 years and you can extend it for up to 5 years.</p>

<p>If you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://integrazionemigranti.gov.it/en-gb/Ricerca-norme/Dettaglio-norma/id/7/Family-reunificatione" rel="external">family they can join you</a> with this permit type.</p>

<p>If you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://integrazionemigranti.gov.it/en-gb/Ricerca-norme/Dettaglio-norma/id/7/Family-reunificatione" rel="external">family they can join you</a> with this permit type.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You need to check with the Italian authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The research institution applies for your permit at the Italian immigration office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/Moduli/it/Formulario%20Visto%20Nazionale.pdf" rel="external">apply for a D visa</a> at the Italian consulate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You sign a ‘contract of stay’ (contratto di soggiorno) and an integration agreement at the local immigration office within 8 days of arriving in Italy and are given an Italian tax code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You apply for your residence permit at the local post office in Italy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You visit the local police station to provide your fingerprints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You collect your residence permit from the local police station once issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You register your address at the local town hall.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>Italian authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed visa application form</li>
  <li>passport for you and your dependents valid for 3 months longer than that of the visa requested, with at least 2 blank pages</li>
  <li>marriage certificate, if married</li>
  <li>birth certificates of any children</li>
  <li>evidence of termination of any previous marriages</li>
  <li>a passport-standard photo taken within 6 months of applying</li>
  <li>signed hosting agreement with an authorised research organisation
degree certificates</li>
  <li>proof of enough money to support yourself</li>
  <li>health insurance to cover your stay in Italy</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation in Italy</li>
</ul>

<p>Any documents issued outside of Italy must be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">legalised (apostilled)</a>.</p>

<p>They must be in Italian. Translations need to be legalised by the Italian consulate.</p>
