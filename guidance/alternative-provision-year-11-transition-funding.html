<p>This guidance sets out the financial support available to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>alternative provision (<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>) schools</li>
  <li>colleges offering alternative provision</li>
</ul>

<p>This funding is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in response to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</li>
  <li>intended to fund additional transition support provided by <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings for year 11 pupils from May 2021 to the end of February 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose of the fund</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> cohort, a significant proportion of whom are in year 11, are already vulnerable and at greater risk of becoming not in education, employment or training (<abbr title="not in education, employment or training">NEET</abbr>) than their peers. These risks have increased since schools closed for most pupils and without substantial transition support, many of the current year 11s in <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> are at heightened risk this year of becoming <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">NEET</abbr>. Becoming <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">NEET</abbr> limits life chances and engagement in education is a protective factor from a range of harms. Bespoke, needs-based interventions are needed to support these year 11 pupils transition to post-16 provision successfully.</p>

<p>Many of these students will attract some disadvantage funding when they are in the 16 to 19 phase. It is up to post-16 providers how they use this funding to support disadvantaged students, and we know some use it to help retain students.</p>

<p>We encourage the <abbr title="alternative provisions">APs</abbr> to engage with the further education sector to help ensure ex-<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> pupils sustain their post-16 destinations and avoid becoming <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">NEET</abbr>.</p>

<p>We also strongly encourage <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings to work with commissioners, whether local authorities or schools, and other local organisations including the voluntary and community sector, to put in place effective intervention packages. This is particularly pertinent to local authorities’ social care teams given pupils in <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> are 12 times more likely to have a social worker than their mainstream peers. Interventions should draw on evidence-based practice wherever possible and be based on pupils’ individual needs, matched with the best locally available provision.</p>

<p>This funding is in response to the continued disruption to education for some pupils due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>What you can spend it on</h2>

<p>We are asking school and college leaders to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify the most effective and best value solution or solutions available locally to support their year 11 cohort in successfully transitioning into post-16 settings</li>
  <li>continue to work with those young people to ensure they are settled and maintain their placements</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings who used this funding in the last academic year to monitor the effectiveness of previous interventions and new activities with the aim of selecting activities that have maximum impact.</p>

<p>This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>backfilling a staff member as a ‘transition specialist’ to organise activities and act as a mentor or advocate for year 11 pupils over the summer or during the autumn term</li>
  <li>extending the contract of existing ‘transition coaches’ or appointing new ones</li>
  <li>engaging third sector organisations to provide engagement or reengagement activities, attendance support or expand existing transition programmes</li>
  <li>providing some level of on-site support for the most at-risk pupils during the autumn term and preparing them for January entry into further education</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/case-studies-on-post-16-transition">Case studies on post-16 transition</a> features some best practice examples of transition support for year 11 students in <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Schools and colleges can fund activities tailored to an individual pupil or can pull together the funding into a package that supports wider groups of year 11s.</p>

<p>If you are a small <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>, or have a small year 11 cohort, this funding allows you to work collaboratively with other local <abbr title="alternative provisions">APs</abbr>.</p>

<p>This funding is not for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extending or re-opening school</li>
  <li>providing additional school places or high needs funding</li>
  <li>driving lessons</li>
  <li>leavers’ assemblies</li>
  <li>laptops</li>
  <li>exams</li>
  <li>transport for pupils</li>
  <li>sports day trophies</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="alternative provisions">APs</abbr> wishing to keep pupils on roll would need to negotiate this separately with commissioners.</p>

<p>If you’re planning an intervention that is very different from those in our guidance, email <a href="mailto:APTransitionFund.COVID-19@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">APTransitionFund.COVID-19@education.gov.uk</a> to discuss eligibility.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Funding will only be available to the following settings with a year 11 <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> cohort (sole or dual-registered):</p>

<ul>
  <li>pupil referral units (<abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies and free schools</li>
  <li>further education colleges offering alternative provision - these providers will need to pre-apply to access this funding</li>
  <li>registered independent schools offering alternative provision - these providers will need to pre-apply to access this funding</li>
  <li>hospital schools, including those that are <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr>, <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> or special academies, foundation or community special schools, and those registered as independent schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Funding is not available to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special schools - unless they operate as a hospital school</li>
  <li>charities - including those known as unregistered <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> - that provide activities for pupils who are in <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings - contact local <abbr title="alternative provisions">APs</abbr> to see how you could engage with their transition work</li>
  <li>mainstream schools</li>
</ul>

<p>The following settings do not need to pre-apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PRU</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> academy</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> free schools</li>
  <li>hospital schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a pupil is registered at a mainstream school and 2 <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> institutions, only the <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> setting where the pupil spends most of their time is eligible for funding (up to £750).</p>

<h2>What you’ll get</h2>

<p>We will provide <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings with up to £750 for each year 11 pupil on their school or college roll, to support these young people to transition into sustained post-16 destinations and to avoid becoming <abbr title="not in education, employment or training">NEET</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can use this funding from now until the end of February 2022 depending on individuals’ needs.</p>

<p>Funding will be allocated to cover actual costs of activities undertaken up to £750 per-year-11 student limits. Both sole-registered and dual-registered students will attract the full £750 per-pupil funding. We will cover the costs actually incurred, up to the limits, when putting in place additional intervention packages to mitigate the increased risks of year 11 pupils unsuccessfully transitioning to post-16 provision.</p>

<p>You cannot take new pupils onto your roll to access transition support. This funding is only for existing year 11s in an <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> setting as of 21 May 2021.</p>

<h2>Accessing the funding</h2>

<p>We are asking schools and colleges to make the necessary payments from their existing budgets and record these in line with local finance policies.</p>

<p>We are making changes to the way schools and colleges submit a claim. We are no longer asking schools and colleges to return individual claim forms to the <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> Transition Fund mailbox.</p>

<p>We will now be using a digital claim form to simplify and speed up the payment process. The digital claim form will be available after spring half-term and will need to be completed by 15 March 2022.</p>

<p>Although we are no longer asking for as much detail on the digital form, we do ask that you keep a record of the following for auditing and evaluation purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a detailed record of additional activities undertaken</li>
  <li>the unique pupil numbers (<abbr title="unique pupil numbers">UPNs</abbr>) and registration status of pupils taking part in these activities</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> colleges and independent schools</h3>

<p>If you are an independent school or <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> college, to assess eligibility for the funding, you’ll need to raise an expression of interest (<abbr title="expression of interest">EOI</abbr>).</p>

<p>Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:APTransitionFund.COVID-19@education.gov.uk">APTransitionFund.COVID-19@education.gov.uk</a> with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your eligible cohort</li>
  <li>their registration status</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also need to send us letters from the commissioner of each <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> place confirming:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of pupils</li>
  <li>their registration status</li>
  <li>that they’re attending due to expulsion, health needs or new arrival - or they’ve been directed off-site by a school to improve their behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="expressions of interest">EOIs</abbr> and commissioner letters should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:APTransitionFund.COVID-19@education.gov.uk">APTransitionFund.COVID-19@education.gov.uk</a> by 25 June 2021.</p>

<p>Funding is not guaranteed and will be based on eligible claims made retrospectively.</p>

<h2>Pooling funding with other <abbr title="alternative provisions">APs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You can pool funding with other <abbr title="alternative provisions">APs</abbr> to create shared activities. Each school will need to claim for funding separately and each individual claim must not exceed the funding limits determined by the cohort.</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>

<p>Payments will be made to reimburse providers for the per-pupil costs they apply for up to the <a href="#funding-limits" class="govuk-link">limits</a>, in March or April 2022.</p>

<p>Payment will be provided for any eligible intervention or interventions and payment will not depend on the outcomes of the intervention or interventions.</p>

<p>You must submit a claim form for assessment to be eligible to receive payment.</p>

<h2>Conditions of funding</h2>

<p>Funding can only be spent by schools and colleges to support their existing year 11 cohort transition and remain successfully engaged in quality post-16 destinations.</p>

<p>Where they need to, <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> providers will be eligible to claim up to the per-pupil <a href="#funding-limits" class="govuk-link">limits</a>.</p>

<p>Schools and colleges will need to provide assurance that costs are legitimate additional costs incurred within the parameters of this funding by taking necessary measures.</p>

<p>Before submitting your claim, your headteacher or school business manager should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how you’ll keep records of all expenditure relating to the <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> transition fund - as is usual with all spend, these records will be necessary for local audit arrangements</li>
  <li>your financial duties when submitting your claim, including signing your name against any claim</li>
  <li>how you’ll show this income and the related expenditure when reporting your accounts</li>
  <li>how you’ll demonstrate you adjusted interventions to have increased impact (if you made use of this funding last academic year)</li>
</ul>

<p>This funding is being provided under section 14 to 16 of the Education Act 2002. We reserve the right to audit the expenditure and will not provide funding for claims which have not been made in accordance with the guidance, in order to protect public spending.</p>

<p>We will use the data you submit as part of your claim along with census data to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>track claims</li>
  <li>monitor the effectiveness of this fund</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of this fund, we are meeting Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You can find out more about how we treat personal information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a>.</p>
