<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>The Medical Devices (Fees Amendment) Regulations 2017 came into force on 1 April 2017. These regulations include the introduction of new fees for amendments to clinical investigations.</p>

<p>You do not need to attach proof of payment to applications. You will receive an invoice to allow you to make payment for the correct amount once your application has been validated.</p>

<p>Information on how to notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> about an amendment for a clinical investigation can be found below under Amendments. Information on the applicable fees are available using the link below.</p>

<p>Please note: The fee rate is based on a single investigational device being used in a study. Where two or more investigational devices are being used and there is no functional relationship between them, the fee will be increased to reflect the additional workload to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. For further clarification, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@mhra.gov.uk">info@mhra.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>This section concerns clinical investigations being conducted in Great Britain only. Please see the separate section below for studies involving Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has received your documents and validated them, we will write to you within 5 working days to confirm that the 60-day assessment has started or we will let you know if there are any issues. If there are any issues raised, the 60-day assessment will start when we receive a valid response.</p>

<p>Day 1 of the 60 days is taken as being the first day that follows the date of acceptance of a valid Notification. For example, If an application is received on 24th August and the assessor validates the submission on 28th August, the clock starts on 29th August.</p>

<p>During the assessment, experts will assess the safety and performance of your device as well as the design of the clinical investigation to be carried out. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will write to you if we require further information. It is essential that you contact the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as soon as possible if you require clarification. Where possible we will arrange a teleconference for a better understanding and to find a resolution within the 60-day assessment time, if there are possible grounds for objection.</p>

<p>A letter will be sent to you by the 60th day with a decision (â€˜objectionâ€™ or â€˜no objectionâ€™) as to whether or not you can carry out the proposed clinical investigation.</p>

<h3>Serious adverse event (SAE) reporting</h3>

<p>This section concerns clinical investigations being conducted in Great Britain only. Please see the separate section below for studies involving Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>All serious adverse events, whether initially considered to be device/procedure related or not, involving a device under clinical investigation within Great Britain should be reported to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>These can be provided using either the MEDDEV 2.7/3 SAE reporting table, or the MDCG 2020-10/2 SAE reporting table, as long as all SAEs are included.</p>

<p>Please send the completed spreadsheet to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> via email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:aic@mhra.gov.uk">aic@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

When providing these summaries please include in tabular format the following information broken down by event type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of serious adverse events</li>
  <li>number of participants affected by those events</li>
  <li>percentage of the total number of enrolled participants affected by those events</li>
</ul>

<p>When providing this table, please ensure it contains information on SAEs for the entire duration of the trial, not just those which have occurred during this quarter.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Event type</th>
      <th scope="col">Number of events</th>
      <th scope="col">Number of participants affected</th>

This enables both the sponsor and <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> to have a complete overview each time it is submitted.</p>

<p>Please send the completed spreadsheet to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>&nbsp;via email at&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@mhra.gov.uk">info@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Coordinated assessment pathway process</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> is working with the Health Research Authority (<abbr title="Heath Research Authority">HRA</abbr>) to develop a new coordinated assessment pathway which will streamline the review of clinical investigations involving medical devices.</p>

<p>During this phase of testing the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Medical Devices review and the Research Ethics Committee (REC) review are being completed in parallel and information will be shared. If you would like more information on the pathway please read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1044661/HRA_Pilot_online_guidance_Jan_2022.pdf" rel="external">guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Amendments</h2>
<p>This section concerns clinical investigations being conducted in Great Britain only. Please see the separate section below for studies involving Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve received a letter of no objection from us, you must notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of all proposed amendments to the investigation. You must wait until we send you another letter of no objection before you implement the changes.</p>

<p>You must tell us about any changes made to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the device under investigation</li>
  <li>study documentation, including the clinical investigation plan</li>
  <li>investigators or investigating institutions</li>
  <li>changes requested by an ethics committee</li>
</ul>

<p>If you donâ€™t tell us about proposed amendments you could be liable to prosecution.</p>

<p>When you notify us of amendments, we need the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>covering letter with:
    <ul>
      <li>the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> reference number for the clinical investigation</li>
      <li>a table with a summary of each proposed change with the reason for each change</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>red lined (showing changes being made) and clean copies of all amended study documentation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a signed statement by, or on behalf of, the manufacturer that the proposed change(s) do not predictably increase the risk to the patient, user or third party</p>
  </li>
  <li>details of who to invoice (full company name, address and registered tax/VAT number)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can send us the amendments by email using the following email address <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CI-amendments@mhra.gov.uk">CI-amendments@mhra.gov.uk</a> unless the files are too big, in which case contact us at the same email address to request a link for uploading the documents. Only amendments submitted to this mailbox will be processed and you should not submit amendments to individuals or any other mailbox.</p>

<p>You will need to pay a fee for amendments to clinical investigations (see&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notify-mhra-about-a-clinical-investigation-for-a-medical-device#fees">Fees</a>&nbsp;above).</p>

<h2>Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>The Northern Ireland Protocol requires Northern Ireland to continue to align with EU rules for devices after 1 January 2021. Therefore, the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) and the in vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR) will apply in Northern Ireland from 26 May 2021, and 26 May 2022 respectively, in line with the EUâ€™s implementation timeline.</p>

<p>All clinical investigations involving a site in Northern Ireland must be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> in line with the requirements of EU MDR 2017/745. This single application will also cover any sites proposed in Great Britain in addition to site(s) in Northern Ireland for the same clinical investigation.</p>

<p>The following sections provide guidance for these applications and the requirements for amendments and post market studies involving sites in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>Assessment of CI Notifications</h3>

<p>When the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has received your documents and validated them, we will write to you within 10 calendar days to confirm that the application is valid and the assessment has started or we will let you know if there are any issues. If there are any issues raised we will confirm these in writing and provide a 10 calendar day deadline for a response. The assessment will not start until we have received a valid response. If, after receipt of the response, the application is still considered to be invalid, or the 10 day deadline has expired, we will write to confirm this within 5 calendar days.</p>

<p>Day 1 of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> assessment is taken as being the date that we confirm that we have received a valid application. During the assessment experts will assess the safety and performance of your device as well as the design of the clinical investigation to be carried out. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will write to you if we require further information. It is essential that you contact the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as soon as possible if you require clarification. If there are possible grounds for refusing authorisation, where possible, we will arrange a teleconference for a better understanding and to find a resolution within the assessment period.</p>

<p>Depending on whether we consult experts, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will inform you of our decision within 45 or 65 calendar days as per the EU MDR. This period will be suspended in the event that we request additional information for a maximum of 7 calendar days for each request, up to a maximum of 3 requests. Any further requests will not result in a clock stop.</p>

<p>A letter will be sent to you by the final day or before with a decision as to whether or not you can carry out the proposed clinical investigation.</p>

<h3>Serious adverse event (SAE) reporting</h3>

<p>The following serious adverse events involving a device under clinical investigation within Northern Ireland should be reported to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>:</p>

<p>(a) any serious adverse event that has a causal relationship with the investigational device, the comparator or the investigation procedure or where such causal relationship is reasonably possible;</p>

<p>(b) any device deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if appropriate action had not been taken, intervention had not occurred, or circumstances had been less fortunate;</p>

<p>(c) any new findings in relation to any event referred to in points (a) and (b).</p>

<p>These should be provided using the MDCG 2020-10/2 SAE reporting table.</p>

<p>Please send the completed spreadsheet to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> via email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:aic@mhra.gov.uk">aic@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Amendments/modifications</h3>
<p>Once youâ€™ve received authorisation from us to conduct the clinical investigation within Northern Ireland, you must notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of all proposed modifications to the investigation before they are implemented. You must wait until we send you another letter of authorisation before you implement substantial modifications. Depending on whether we consult experts, we will issue our decision within 38 or 45 calendar days.</p>

<p>You must tell us about all modifications, however only those considered to be substantial will require authorisation by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Substantial modification includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes to the medical device under investigation</li>
  <li>changes to the design or methodology of the clinical investigation, or to background information</li>
  <li>changes to the procedures undertaken by participants</li>
  <li>changes to the risk/benefit assessment for the study</li>
  <li>significant changes to study documentation such as clinical investigation plan, investigatorâ€™s brochure, participant information sheets, consent forms, letters to GPs or other clinicians, information sheets for relatives or carers</li>
  <li>appointment of a new chief investigator</li>
  <li>inclusion of a new trial site (not listed in the original application)</li>
  <li>appointment of a new principal investigator at a trial site</li>
  <li>temporary halt of a study to protect participants from harm, and the planned restart of a study following a temporary halt</li>
  <li>a change to the definition of the end of the study</li>
  <li>extension of the study beyond the period specified in the application form</li>
  <li>any other significant change to the protocol</li>
  <li>changes requested by an ethics committee</li>
</ul>

<p>For non-substantial modifications you are only required to notify us to ensure our records are up-to-date. If upon review of the proposed non-substantial modification, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> consider it to fall within the substantial category, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will inform the sponsor, and the proposed modification should not be implemented until an <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> authorisation is received.</p>

<p>Non-substantial modifications are changes that are unlikely to have a substantial impact on the safety, health or rights of the subjects or on the robustness or reliability of the clinical data generated by the investigation and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a change of sponsor(s) or sponsorâ€™s legal representative</li>
  <li>a change to the insurance or indemnity arrangements for the study</li>
  <li>minor changes to the protocol or other study documentation, e.g. correcting typographical errors, updating contact points, minor clarifications</li>
  <li>changes to the chief investigatorâ€™s research team</li>
  <li>changes to the research team at particular trial sites (other than appointment of a new principal investigator)</li>
  <li>changes in funding arrangements</li>
  <li>minor changes in the documentation used by the research team for recording study data</li>
  <li>changes in the logistical arrangements for storing or transporting samples</li>
</ul>

<h3>Post Market Studies</h3>
<p>You must notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of all clinical investigations conducted in Northern Ireland involving CE marked devices that also involve procedures additional to the normal conditions of use of the device, that are also invasive or burdensome.</p>

<p>The notification must be made at least 30 days prior to commencing the study.</p>

<p>When you notify us of these clinical investigations, we need the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Application form</li>
  <li>Investigatorâ€™s Brochure</li>
  <li>Clinical Investigation Plan/protocol</li>
  <li>Signed statement</li>
  <li>REC opinion</li>
  <li>Proof of insurance cover or indemnification of subjects</li>
  <li>PIS and IC</li>
  <li>Arrangement to ensure protection and confidentiality of personal data</li>
  <li>Details of the technical documentation (risk analysis, test reports) kept available</li>
</ul>

<h2>In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (<abbr title="In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices">IVDs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Unless an exemption applies, all <abbr title="In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices">IVDs</abbr> being placed on the market or put into service in the UK are required to have the relevant mark of conformity (UKCA, CE or CE UKNI).</p>

<p>This includes <abbr title="In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices">IVDs</abbr> used in clinical trials of medicines (CTIMP) to stratify patients for inclusion/exclusion in the trial or stratified to a cohort within a trial.</p>

<p>At the time of the clinical trial application, where clinical performance of the <abbr title="In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device">IVD</abbr> is yet to be demonstrated, for CTIMPs taking place in GB the <abbr title="In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices">IVDs</abbr> must have a UK mark of conformity only for the analytical performance of the <abbr title="In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device">IVD</abbr> (e.g. detection of a biomarker). This will include reagents, equipment, calibrators, controls and software. These are likely to be self-certified <abbr title="In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices">IVDs</abbr> under the current medical device regulations. For CTIMP conducted in Northern Ireland separate guidance will be provided.</p>

<p>Alternatively the Sponsor must provide the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> with a tabular summary description of the analytical methods including acceptance limits and parameters for performing validation.</p>

<p>Trials which determine the clinical performance of the assay (biomarker validity) will need to be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-medical-devices-to-place-on-the-market">registered</a> as <abbr title="In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device">IVD</abbr> performance evaluation studies.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/in-vitro-diagnostic-medical-devices-guidance-on-legislation">guidance on in vitro diagnostic medical devices: guidance on legislation</a>.</p>

<h2>Special circumstances for healthcare establishments</h2>

<p>You donâ€™t need to notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of a clinical investigation if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have manufactured the medical device <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/in-house-manufacture-of-medical-devices/in-house-manufacture-of-medical-devices">in-house</a> for your own patients with no objective to place it on the market</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of a clinical investigation if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you want to provide a medical device to another organisation, that up until now has been manufactured in-house for patients, for data to support safety and performance of a commercial product.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health Research Authority (<abbr title="Heath Research Authority">HRA</abbr>) and Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW) Approval</h2>

<p><abbr title="Heath Research Authority">HRA</abbr> and HCRW approval applies to all project-based research taking place in the NHS in England and Wales. It brings together the assessment of governance and legal compliance, undertaken by dedicated <abbr title="Heath Research Authority">HRA</abbr> and HCRW staff, with the independent Research Ethics Committee (REC) opinion provided through the UK Research Ethics Service.</p>

<p>It replaces the need for local checks of legal compliance and related matters by each participating organisation in England and Wales. For information on how to prepare and submit an application for <abbr title="Heath Research Authority">HRA</abbr> and HCRW Approval, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/approvals-amendments/what-approvals-do-i-need/hra-approval/" rel="external">refer to the <abbr title="Heath Research Authority">HRA</abbr> website</a>.</p>
