<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This guide explains the new rules for British nationals applying for residency in Spain, what documents are required and information on the right to reside in Spain for both British nationals and non-EU family members.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>There will be no change to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-leaving-the-eu-what-you-need-to-know">rights and status of EU nationals living in the UK, nor UK nationals living in the EU</a>, while the UK remains in the EU.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="register-as-a-resident">Register as a resident</h2>

<p>As an EU citizen you must <a rel="external" href="http://extranjeros.empleo.gob.es/">register as a resident</a> if you plan on living in Spain for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>You should register in person at the <a rel="external" href="http://www.seat.mpr.gob.es/portal/servicios/extranjeria/extranjeria_ddgg.html">Oficina de Extranjeros</a> (immigration office) or designated <a rel="external" href="https://www.policia.es/documentacion/oficinas/oficinas_extran.html">police station</a> in the province where you live.</p>

<p>Before going to your local Oficina de Extranjeros or designated police station, you must make an appointment online, which can be done on the <a rel="external" href="https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/icpplus/index.html">Spanish public administration website</a>.</p>

<p>Once on the online appointment booking system, you should select the province where you live and then the option “Certificados UE” and follow the instructions to select and confirm your appointment time.</p>

<p>When you go to your appointment, you will be required to <a rel="external" href="http://extranjeros.empleo.gob.es/es/InformacionInteres/InformacionProcedimientos/documentacion/index.html">provide documents</a> to support your appplication - see an <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/documents-formalities/registering-residence/spain/index_en.htm">English language summary of the documents you will need to bring</a></p>

<p>The Spanish authorities will issue you with a credit-card-sized residence certificate with your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>nationality</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Número de Identificación Extranjeros">NIE</abbr> number (Número de Identificación Extranjero)</li>
  <li>date of registration</li>
</ul>

<p>Older residence certificates are larger (A4 size) but are still valid. You do not need to apply for a credit-card-sized certificate unless your circumstances change (for example your address) or unless you want to.</p>

<p>After you have been registered as a resident for five years, you can apply for a certificate of permanent residence in Spain. You will be issued with a similar credit card size Residence Certificate, but it will additionally state that you are a permanent resident (residente permanente).</p>

<h3 id="non-eu-family-members">Non-EU family members</h3>

<p>An EU citizen´s family members who are not EU citizens can <a rel="external" href="http://extranjeros.empleo.gob.es/es/InformacionInteres/InformacionProcedimientos/CiudadanosComunitarios/hoja103/index.html">register to live with them</a>.</p>

<p>They must register in person at the Oficina de Extranjeros or designated police station within 3 months of entering Spain.They will be issued with Tarjetas de Residencia de Familiar de Cuidadano de la Union (residency cards for family members of EU citizens). Additional documents will be required.</p>

<p>Family members can only register if they entered Spain with valid passports and visas (where required).</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-the-residency-regulations">Changes to the residency regulations</h3>

<p>In 2012 the Spanish government introduced details of the new residency requirements for all EU citizens, including British nationals.</p>

<p>EU citizens applying for residency in Spain may be required to produce evidence of sufficient financial means to support themselves (and dependants).</p>

<p>Applicants may also be asked for proof of private or public healthcare insurance. More details about the application process and documentation you need are available on the website of the <a rel="external" href="http://extranjeros.empleo.gob.es/es/InformacionInteres/InformacionProcedimientos/Ciudadanosnocomunitarios/index.html">Spanish Ministry for Work and Social Security</a>.</p>

<p>The Ministerial Order sets out the new residency requirements and some of the documentation applicants may be asked to present. We have created an unofficial translation of the Ministerial Order below.</p>

<h3 id="residency-requirements---for-information-only">Residency requirements - for information only</h3>
<p>This is an unofficial translation by the British Embassy* of the important parts of Spanish Order 1490 of 9 July 2012, setting out the rules on the entry, free movement and residence in Spain of nationals of other European Union (EU) Member States and European Economic Area states.</p>

<h3 id="article-1-right-of-residence-for-a-period-of-longer-than-three-months">Article 1: Right of residence for a period of longer than three months</h3>
<p>Nationals of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a member state of the European Union</li>
  <li>other States party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area</li>
  <li>Switzerland</li>
</ul>

<p>have a right to reside in Spain for a period of longer than three months if they meet the conditions laid down in Article 7 of Royal Decree 240/2007, of 16 February 2007, on entrance, free movement and residence in Spain of Nationals of European Union member states and of other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>

<h3 id="article-2--attendance-and-registration-on-the-central-register-of-foreign-nationals">Article 2:  Attendance and registration on the Central Register of Foreign Nationals</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Applications for registration as residents by the nationals mentioned in Article 1 shall comply with the provisions of sections 5 and 6 of Article 7 of Royal Decree 240/2007, of 16 February 2007.</li>
  <li>Applications will be filed in person in the Immigration Office of the province where they intend to reside or in the relevant Police Station.</li>
  <li>If the application for registration does not meet the necessary requirements for it to be processed, the interested person will be required to correct any faults or attach the obligatory documents within a period of ten days and he will be informed that, if he does not do this, it will be assumed that he has abandoned his application, by reasoned decision, which does not exhaust the administrative procedure and which may be appealed against.</li>
  <li>The certificate will be issued immediately, once compliance with the corresponding requirements has been confirmed. This certificate will give the name, nationality and address of the registered person, his foreign national identity number and the date of registration.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="article-3-supporting-documentation">Article 3: Supporting documentation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>All applications for registration must be accompanied by the applicant’s passport or national identity document, which shall be valid and in force. If these documents have expired, a copy of these and the application for renewal must be produced</li>
  <li>In addition, the following documentation will be required, depending on the applicant’s circumstances:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a) Employed workers must produce a declaration to the effect that they have been hired by the employer or a certificate of employment. These documents must include, as a minimum, details of the name and address of the company, tax identification and Employer’s Social Security Number. Presentation of an employment contract registered with the corresponding Public Employment Service or a document of registration or situation similar to registration with the corresponding Social Security System will be accepted, although it will not be necessary to produce these documents if the interested party agrees to have his details checked against the General Social Security Finance Office files “Ficheros de la Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>b) Self-employed workers must produce evidence to the effect that they are self-employed. Registration on the Economic Activities List “Censo de Actividades Económicos” or proof of their establishment by means of registration in the Mercantile Registry “Registro Mercantil” or a document of registration or situation similar to registration with the corresponding Social Security System will be accepted, although it will not be necessary to produce these documents if the interested person agrees to have his details checked against the General Social Security Finance Office or Taxation Office files “Ficheros de la Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social o de la Agencia Tributaria”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>c) People who do not work in Spain must produce documentation proving that they comply with the following two conditions:</p>
  </li>
  <li>i. Public or private health insurance contracted in Spain or in another country, provided that it ensures cover in Spain during their period of residence equivalent to the cover provided by the National Health System. Pensioners will be considered to meet this condition if they can prove, by means of the corresponding certificate, that they are entitled to health care paid for by the State from which they receive their pension</li>
  <li>
    <p>ii. have sufficient resources, for themselves and their family members, not to become a burden on Spain’s social assistance system during their period of residence. Proof of the possession of sufficient resources, whether from regular income, including work income or income of another kind, or from ownership of assets, will be given by any legally admissible evidence, such as property deeds, certified cheques, documentation proving that income from capital is received or credit cards. In this latter case, an up to date bank certificate proving the amount available by way of credit on the aforesaid card shall be produced.  The assessment of sufficient resources must be carried out on an individual basis, taking into account the applicant’s personal and family circumstances. The possession of  resources that are more than the amount established each year by the State General Budgets Act “Ley de Presupuestos Generales de Estado” that justifies the right to receive non-contributory benefits, taking into account the interested persons’ personal and family circumstances, will be regarded as sufficient proof to meet this requirement</p>
  </li>
  <li>d) Students, including those who are taking vocational training courses, must present documents proving fulfillment with the following conditions:</li>
  <li>i. Enrolment in a public or private establishment, accredited or financed by the competent educational administration</li>
  <li>ii. Public or private health insurance contracted in Spain or in another country, provided that it ensures complete cover in Spain. However, this condition will be deemed to be met if the student has a European Health Insurance Card that is valid for a period that covers the entire period of residence and that allows him to receive, exclusively, any medical assistance that are necessary from a medical point of view, taking into account the nature of the assistance and the envisaged duration.</li>
  <li>iii. Sworn Statement that he has sufficient resources for himself and his family members, so that they do not become a burden on Spain’s social assistance system during their period of residence. Participation in European Union programmes that promote educational exchanges for students and teachers will be regarded as sufficient proof of compliance with these requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="article-4-application-of-the-right-to-reside-for-a-period-of-longer-than-three-months-to-family-members">Article 4: Application of the right to reside for a period of longer than three months to family members</h3>

<h2 id="apply-for-permanent-residency">Apply for permanent residency</h2>

<h2 id="register-on-the-padrn">Register on the padrón</h2>

<p>If you are resident in Spain for more than three months, you must also register yourself on the padrón, which is a list of all the people who live in a certain town.</p>

<h3 id="how-you-register">How you register</h3>

<p>You register for the padrón at the local town hall by filling in the form they provide.</p>

<p>Take official identification with you such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a passport</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="Número de Identificación Extranjeros">NIE</abbr> or residence certificate / card</li>

<p>Your town hall will issue you a certificado de empadronamiento. You may have to return to collect your certificate, but the authorities will complete your registration on the same day.</p>

  <li>register a car with a Spanish number plate</li>
</ul>

<p>More information can be found on <a rel="external" href="http://www.residenteseuropeos.com/">Residentes Europeos website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="padrn-status-checks">Padrón status checks</h3>

<p>You must confirm your padrón status <a rel="external" href="https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/03/24/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-3109.pdf">every 2 or 5 years in order to remain registered</a></p>

<p>If you have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residency-requirements-in-spain#residency-requirements">certificate of residence</a> your town hall will contact you every 5 years from the date you register to confirm that you still live in the town and wish to remain on the padrón.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residency-requirements-in-spain#residency-requirements">certificate of residence</a> your town hall will contact you every 2 years.</p>

<p>Your town hall will remove you from the padrón register if they are unable to confirm you still live in the town.</p>

<p>You can check with your town hall to check your padrón register at any time.</p>

<p>For certain services (eg social services) you may be required to show a recent padrón certificate which is less than 3 months old. You can obtain this at your local town hall.</p>
