<p>Visitors aged 12 and over need to take a lateral flow device test (LFD) before coming for their visit. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic#testing">Find out more here</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of other ways to <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">contact someone in prison if you are unable to visit them</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>

<p>The closest railway station is Leicester.
The prison is opposite Leicester Royal Infirmary (hospital) which is well signposted.</p>

<p>To plan your journey by public transport:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" rel="external">National Rail Enquiries</a>
</li>
  <li>use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.traveline.info/" rel="external">Traveline for local bus times</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no car parking available at Leicester Prison but there are ‘pay and display’ spaces nearby and in the city centre.</p>

<h3>Entering Leicester Prison</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>Each adult visitor is allowed to take in a maximum of £20 in coins (notes are not allowed).</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children.</p>

<p>You may need to have your finger or thumb prints scanned (or an iris scan) as part of a security check. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Leicester Prison has a dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses, no see-through clothing and no headwear, other than that worn for religious or medical reasons which may require a private search).</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into prison. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs, car seats, mobile phones and cameras.</p>

<p>Visitor conduct and expected behaviours are displayed on each table in the visiting hall. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>A family-friendly visitors centre is run by the charity, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonadvice.org.uk/hmp-leicester" rel="external">Prison Advice and Care Trust (PACT)</a>.</p>

<p>It has a children’s play area, drinks and snacks.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days being run.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Leicester Prison</h2>
<p>You may not be able to speak with someone during their first few days. This is because it can take time to approve who they can be in touch with. But usually a PIN phone account is set up on the second day and then the men can submit their contact list.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms and have to use a prison phone. They will always need to call you, rather than you call them.</p>

<p>If you need to contact the prison, telephone: 0116 228 3129.</p>

<p>Prisoners can phone anyone named on their approved contact list of friends and family. This list is checked by security.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">prison voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Leicester Prison using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prison number on the envelope, under the address. If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Leicester</a>.</p>

<p>Write your own name and address on the back of the envelope.</p>

<p>Paper and envelopes can be bought from ‘canteen’ (the prison shop), so prisoners can write back.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Gifts are not permitted under any circumstances at Leicester Prison.</p>

<p>You can send prisoners money instead which they can use to buy items through a catalogue system.</p>
