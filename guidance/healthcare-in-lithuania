<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<h2 id="HealthcareLithuania">Healthcare in Lithuania after Brexit</h2>

<p>You should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national visiting or living in Lithuania.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Lithuania in place.</p>

<p>For example, if you are a current S1 form holder, or a posted worker or student using a <a href="#EHIC">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>, you will not be able to rely on these to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-live-or-work-in-lithuania">If you live or work in Lithuania</h3>

<p>All legal residents in Lithuania must have mandatory health insurance called Privalomasis Sveikatos Draudimas (PSD).</p>

<p>People holding temporary residency permits may also opt into PSD. Payments are €336 annually, unless covered by the employer and/or subsidised by the government.</p>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-lithuania#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Lithuania</a></li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Lithuania</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>

<p>Your S1 certificate may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Lithuania and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-lithuania-after-brexit">Studying in Lithuania after Brexit</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Lithuania and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Lithuania before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK if you are living in Lithuania and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>You may use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge when visiting the UK after exit day if you are living in Lithuania before exit day and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="EHIC">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Lithuania and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Lithuania.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need.</p>

<p>If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>Your <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> will be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<p>This information is about healthcare in Lithuania before Brexit. <a href="#HealthcareLithuania">Find out about healthcare for UK nationals living and working in Lithuania after Brexit</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>UK nationals living or working in Lithuania must follow the registration process to access the same entitlements to healthcare as Lithuanian nationals.</p>

<p>All non-emergency state healthcare services are available to everyone and are funded by Compulsory Health Insurance or PSD contributions. Your contribution to PSD depends on your residency status, citizenship and insurance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you are a permanent resident of Lithuania, you must contribute to the statutory healthcare system PSD</li>
  <li>if you have a Lithuanian temporary residency permit you have the choice of whether you want to opt into the PSD</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all state healthcare services can be recharged back to PSD. The following services can be recharged:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you are sent by the GP to the specialist or practice</li>
  <li>if the practice has a contract with the Territorial Health Insurance Fund (THIF), this is called Teritorine Ligoniu Kasa in Lithuanian</li>
  <li>if the procedure is covered by state insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not contribute to PSD you should consider taking out private healthcare insurance.</p>

<h3 id="uk-posted-workers">UK posted workers</h3>

<p>If you are a worker posted by a UK company to Lithuania, you may be entitled to health cover funded by the UK in the country you are posted to.</p>

<p>You can find out more from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Lithuania. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you are a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>

<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>You can find more information under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in Lithuania at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free if you are staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Check you’re being treated by a healthcare provider in the state system as you will not be covered for private healthcare with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Lithuania if you have a pre-existing health condition.</p>

<p>You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have to make sure you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel.</p>

<p>Take any documents about your health condition or medicine with you.</p>

<p>If you are travelling to have planned medical treatment, read the NHS guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">seeking medical treatment in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-services-in-lithuania">Healthcare services in Lithuania</h2>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>

<p>If you have a serious or life-threatening emergency or you need an ambulance, call 112. This number is free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>

<p>All non-emergency state healthcare services are available to everyone and are funded by Compulsory Health Insurance, known as Privalomasis Sveikatos Draudimas (PSD) contributions. If you do not contribute to PSD you should take out private healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>In general, you need to be referred by a doctor for any hospital treatment. However, if you have private healthcare insurance you do not need a referral from a GP to see a specialist, but you cannot receive a refund for care.</p>

<p>Make sure you are referred to a state hospital as only these provide treatment free of charge. Even in a state hospital you will need a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. Check you are not treated as a private patient.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>

<p>Prescriptions are given by both GPs and specialists. Prescriptions can be subsidised up to 100% of the base cost of the drug (for which the pharmacy bought it) meaning you only need to pay the difference between the sale price and the base price.</p>

<p>Your doctor will determine how much of the price compensation you are eligible for.</p>

<p>When using your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, people of working age are charged 50% and pensioners are charged about 10%. Pensioners will have to declare they receive a UK State Pension to pay the lower rate.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-own-medicines-to-lithuania">Bringing your own medicines to Lithuania</h2>

<p>Some prescribed medicines contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in the UK. This means that additional legal controls apply to these medicines.</p>

<p>You may need a personal license to take controlled medicines abroad. Specific requirements also apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the information that you must take with you</li>
  <li>how you carry your controlled medicines</li>
</ul>
