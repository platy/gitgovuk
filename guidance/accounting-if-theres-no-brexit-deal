<p>The corporate reporting requirements of the UK’s Companies Act 2006 will not be deemed automatically equivalent to the EU’s Accounting Directive. This means UK reporting requirements (such as <abbr title="Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in the UK">UK GAAP</abbr>) may no longer be considered equivalent to the reporting requirements of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea"><abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> countries</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a UK incorporated parent company with a subsidiary based in the <abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> you need to check the relevant reporting requirements in the <abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> state where the subsidiary is based.</p>

<p id="uk-public-company-uk">If you are a UK company with an <abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> presence, for example, a branch, you will also need to check the relevant reporting requirements in the <abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> state where you have a presence.</p>

<p>Accounting-related changes in the Transparency Directive (<abbr title="Transparency Directive">TD</abbr>) and Prospectus Directive (<abbr title="Prospectus Directive">PD</abbr>) framework, will affect the way companies raise capital and obtain or continue to trade securities on a regulated market.</p>

<p>UK incorporated groups with securities admitted to trading on a UK regulated market will be required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to use accounts prepared using EU-adopted <abbr title="international accounting standards">IAS</abbr> for all accounting periods starting before 31 October 2019 for the <abbr title="Transparency Directive">TD</abbr> and <abbr title="Prospectus Directive">PD</abbr> – you won’t need to restate those accounts or filings retrospectively</li>
  <li>prepare accounts using UK-adopted <abbr title="international accounting standards">IAS</abbr> for all accounting periods beginning after exit day</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="operating-as-a-uk-public-company-with-eea-listing">Operating as a UK public company with <abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> listing</h3>

<p id="uk-public-company-eea">UK incorporated groups that issue debt from a subsidiary incorporated in the EU that is admitted to trading on an EU regulated market, or itself maintains an admission to trading within the EU will need to ensure it continues to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>comply with EU local regulatory provisions; this may include the need to publish accounts using EU-adopted <abbr title="international accounting standards">IAS</abbr> or <abbr title="international accounting standards">IAS</abbr> as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board for the subsidiary, for the parent company or for the whole group for listing in the EU</li>
  <li>produce accounts in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006 for domestic filing purposes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="audit-committees">Audit committees</h3>

<p id="uk-audit-committees">All UK Public Interest Entities (banks, building societies, insurers and issuers of securities that trade on UK regulated markets) will still be subject to the Disclosure and Transparency Rules issued by the Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>), and other rules issued by the Prudential Regulation Authority (<abbr title="Prudential Regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>).</p>

<p>This requirement originates from the Audit Directive and  will still apply subject to 2 important changes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>UK issuers of shares or debt securities that are only admitted to trading on <abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> regulated markets will no longer be subject to this framework.</li>
  <li>The current exemption for those businesses with a parent that is also subject to the same Audit Directive requirement will only to apply but only where the parent is incorporated in the UK. For subsidiaries that are issuers of securities on UK regulated markets the parent may be subject either to the <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>’s or the <abbr title="Prudential Regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>’s rules. However, for subsidiaries that are banks or insurers and qualify under the more limited exemption provided by the <abbr title="Prudential Regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>, the parent must be subject to the <abbr title="Prudential Regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>’s rules.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="appointing-auditors">Appointing auditors</h3>

<p id="uk-appointing-auditors">If you are a UK company, you will still need to appoint a UK registered audit firm. It will then be for an individual UK registered auditor to sign the audit report on behalf of the firm when it is due.</p>

<p>However, some rules relating to approving individuals and firms for registration as auditors will change. To find out more read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/auditing-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">guidance on auditing if there’s no Brexit deal</a>.</p>

<p id="eea-cross-border">After the UK leaves the EU, <abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> companies with a UK incorporated subsidiary won’t be eligible for certain exemptions from preparing and filing accounts.</p>

<p>For example, an intermediate UK parent company with an immediate <abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> parent may no longer be exempt from producing group accounts. These companies may need to prepare group accounts and file them with Companies House, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.</p>

<p>In addition, UK registered dormant companies with <abbr title="European Economic Area ">EEA</abbr> parents will be required to prepare individual annual accounts for accounting periods beginning after 31 October 2019 and file these with Companies House.</p>

<p>Other exemptions that will be removed for financial periods beginning after 31 October 2019 relate to exemption from producing the non-financial information statements and alteration of accounting reference dates.</p>
