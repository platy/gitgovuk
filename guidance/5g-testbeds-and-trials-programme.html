<h2>About the programme</h2>

<p>The 5G Testbeds and Trials Programme (<abbr title="5G Testbeds and Trials Programme">5GTT</abbr>), part of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS), looks to harness areas where the UK has a competitive advantage – such as in scientific research, engineering talent and our rich variety of technology businesses.</p>

<p>The 5G Programme is exploring the benefits and challenges of deploying 5G technologies in line with the following key objectives:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Accelerate the deployment of 5G networks and ensure the UK can take early advantage of the applications those networks can enable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximise the productivity and efficiency benefits to the UK from 5G.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create new opportunities for UK businesses at home and abroad, and encourage inward investment.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Successes so far:</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The 5G Programme funded the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/5guk-test-network">5GUK Test Networks</a>, which built and integrated three university testbeds (University of Surrey, King’s College London and the University of Bristol) to provide the UK’s first end-to-end 5G network in early 2018.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The initial portfolio of projects successfully developed small-scale testbeds and they were used by projects to trial 69 technologies, products, and applications. For example: <br><br> - The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://liverpool5g.org.uk/" rel="external">Liverpool 5G project</a> created the largest 5G mmWave mesh network in the UK and second largest in the world, providing an affordable private network to test new health applications. <br> - The University of Bristol’s Smart Internet Lab managed to deliver the world’s <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/smart/5g-demonstrations/5g-music-lesson-with-jamie-cullum/" rel="external">first 5G music lesson</a>, connecting musicians in London and Bristol to play together, thanks to the low latency capabilities of 5G.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>We’ve already completed 8 projects and have over 30 more projects up and running in 34 counties across 13 regions across the UK, with around 200 project partners.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>We’ve encouraged industry to take a leading position in global 5G deployment. We saw all four mobile network operators launching 5G networks in the UK during 2019.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Across the 5G Programme, we’re exploring 140 5G use cases accelerating 5G adoption in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uk5g.org/discover/5g-industry/" rel="external">targeted sectors</a> (including agriculture, utilities, automotive, transport and logistics).</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>We’re supporting over 10 new and emerging equipment vendors and testing new access technologies in a range of trials to help broaden and secure the UK’s telecom supply chain in line with the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/5g-supply-chain-diversification-strategy">diversification strategy</a>.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Despite the impact of coronavirus, the 5G projects have been resilient in their progress and testing, and 15 new projects from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/28-million-to-trial-innovative-new-uses-of-5g-to-improve-peoples-lives">5G Create competition</a> were awarded £28 million of industry matched funding in late 2020.</p>

</div>

<p>This is part of the government’s response to the challenge of diversifying the UK’s supply market for radio equipment set out in the Diversification Strategy. Up to £30 million of government funding will be available.</p>

<p>The aims of the FRANC project are to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Accelerate the development of high-performance 5G Open RAN solutions that meet UK dense urban requirements by 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attract new 5G RAN suppliers to conduct R&amp;D in the UK, and foster professional collaborations between potential new entrants into the UK’s public network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute to the delivery of the 5G Supply Chain Diversification Strategy’s objectives of disaggregated supply chains, open interfaces by default, and security being a priority in network deployment.</p>
</li>
