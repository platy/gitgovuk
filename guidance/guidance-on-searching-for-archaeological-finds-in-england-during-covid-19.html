<p><strong>The government has published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021">‘COVID-19 Response - Spring 2021’ guidance</a>, setting out the roadmap out of the current lockdown for England. This explains how the government intends to ease restrictions over time. <br><br>This guidance includes changes to restrictions for step 1B, which come into force on 29 March. It will be updated ahead of any relevant changes in the roadmap steps, which are set out in the roadmap.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Metal-detecting</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you intend to go metal detecting you must ensure you are complying with the law, including the restrictions on meeting with other people, and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">current rules on self-isolation</a>. You should also comply with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">all relevant guidance</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you intend to metal detect on private land or a public outdoor space you must obtain permission from the landowner and/or occupier before venturing onto any land.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have previously had permission from a landowner and/or occupier, you should now check again that they are happy for you to continue to search on their land.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organised metal-detecting is not allowed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think carefully about how you will interact with others, such as landowners and/or occupiers and other members of the public. Make a plan of how you will ensure that you practise and maintain safe social distancing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People wishing to search the Thames foreshore should refer to the <a href="http://pla.co.uk/Environment/Thames-foreshore-permits" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Port of London Authority guidance</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Advice for land managers and landowners can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-on-accessing-green-spaces-safely" class="govuk-link">Access to green spaces guidance</a></p>

<p>The <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/24/contents">Treasure Act 1996</a> and its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/treasure-act-1996-code-of-practice-2nd-revision-england-and-wales">Code of Practice</a> covers finds made which meet the definition of treasure. These can include finds made when digging in a garden or during construction work, and finds made above ground, either inside or outside. The way you report finds has changed due to Coronavirus restrictions. Should you make a treasure find, or other archaeological discovery, this guidance provides information on how you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fulfil your legal obligations under the Treasure Act 1996</li>
  <li>ensure your discoveries can be recorded and contribute to archaeological knowledge</li>
  <li>ensure the protection and preservation of archaeology</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance has been written with advice from the British Museum’s Portable Antiquities Scheme on how to report your finds and to protect in situ archaeology.</p>

<h2>Protecting archaeology</h2>

<p>Especially at this time, finders should avoid metal-detecting on ground that has not been recently disturbed to avoid damaging in situ archaeology (such as a previously undisturbed hoard or human burial). This is because it may be difficult at this time to get archaeological assistance in excavating them.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>If you discover an in situ find (such as a hoard or burial):</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Cover it up, make a note of its location and let your local Finds Liaison Officer and the landowner and/or occupier know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Finds Liaison Officer will then be able to advise you when and if an archaeological excavation can be organised. This could take many weeks or months to be arranged and therefore information about the site should be treated in confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are not sure whether you have found a hoard in-situ or it is dispersed (for example a coin hoard scattered by ploughing) you should seek advice from your Finds Liaison Officer before excavating further.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Finders should note that in the event of an object or archaeological site being damaged, under the Treasure Act 1996: Code of Practice, the Secretary of State may determine that any reward payable may be abated, in full or part.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://finds.org.uk/getinvolved/guides/codeofpractice" class="govuk-link">The Code of Practice for Responsible Metal Detecting</a> provides more detailed guidance on how to search for archaeology responsibly.</p>

<h2>Reporting your finds</h2>

<p>Due to current social distancing requirements, you will have to report finds in a different way to ensure that you and your Finds Liaison Officer remain safe. You may currently be unable to physically hand your finds into your Finds Liaison Officer, and as such, there will be new systems in place for reporting. Finds Liaison Officers will aim to provide advice on reporting via phone and/or email.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>If you have found potential treasure</h3>

<p>Finders are still required to report any potential treasure finds within 14 days and follow all other legal obligations under the Treasure Act 1996.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You must report any potential treasure to your local <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://finds.org.uk/contacts">Finds Liaison Officer</a> or the British Museum (treasure@britishmuseum.org).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be asked to complete a “treasure declaration form” and submit a photo of your find. This will be for your own records to show that you have fulfilled your legal obligations, and also for the Finds Liaison Officers to begin processing your case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should hold onto finds, secure them in a safe place, and await instructions from their local Finds Liaison Officer on when it is safe to hand them in. This may be several weeks or months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be aware that any such finds potentially belong to the Crown (or the Crown franchises in the Duchies of Cornwall, Lancaster and the City of London) and you should look after them with care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advice on how to safely store and look after your finds at home can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://finds.org.uk/conservation/index" class="govuk-link">Portable Antiquities Scheme website</a>. If a find meets the definition of treasure under the Treasure Act 1996, the finder does not own the find, and it is illegal for them to attempt to sell it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many aspects of the treasure process are currently paused or delayed. This means that your case will take significantly longer than usual. However, you will be updated when your case can progress. We appreciate your patience and understanding at this time.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>If you have found a non-treasure find</h3>

<p>It is recognised that public finds (including those found by metal-detectorists, field-walkers and mudlarks) make an immense contribution to our knowledge of the archaeology and history of Britain.</p>

<p>At the current time, it will not normally be possible for Finds Liaison Officers to meet directly with finders to record finds. However, you can still share your discoveries for recording.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You should contact your local <a href="https://finds.org.uk/contacts" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Finds Liaison Officer</a>. They can support self-recording and provide advice on the digital reporting of important finds. If you have trouble reaching your local Finds Liaison Officer or receive a non-temporary out of office response from them, please email the British Museum (treasure@britishmuseum.org).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be advised to hold onto your finds for recording at a later date. The <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://finds.org.uk/getinvolved/guides/codeofpractice">Code of Practice for Responsible Metal Detecting</a> recommends that finders keep a record of the find-spot for each find, and advice on how to safely store and look after your finds at home can be found on the <a href="https://finds.org.uk/conservation/index" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Portable Antiquities Scheme website</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The process of recording finds on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database may take longer than usual.</p>

<p>If you currently have a find with a Finds Liaison Officer and you would like its return, you should contact your Finds Liaison Officer. In most cases, it is unlikely that they will be able to return it directly, but they will be able to advise you on when it may be safe to do so. This may be several weeks or months.</p>
</div>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated as additional steps are made if they impact any of the above.</p>
