<p>The transition to zero emission vehicles (<abbr title="zero emission vehicles">ZEVs</abbr>) will help the UK to meet our legally binding climate change targets. It will improve air quality in our towns and cities and support economic growth. It will also put us at the forefront of the electric vehicle (<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>) revolution with many vehicles built in the UK.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Prime Minister announced that we will <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-outlines-his-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution-for-250000-jobs">end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030</a>, with all new cars and vans being fully zero emission at the tailpipe from 2035.</p>

<p>Building on the £1.9 billion from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-2020-documents/spending-review-2020">Spending Review 2020</a>, the government has committed an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-path-to-net-zero-set-out-in-landmark-strategy">additional £620 million to support the transition to <abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The additional funding will support the rollout of charging infrastructure with a particular focus on local on-street residential charging and targeted plug-in vehicle grants.</p>

<p>The total funding committed by this government to vehicle grants and infrastructure is £2.5 billion.</p>

<p>Local leadership in this transition is crucial. Local authorities have a crucial role to play in enabling the transition to <abbr title="zero emission vehicles">ZEVs</abbr> in their areas, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proactively supporting and delivering the rollout of electric vehicle chargepoints</li>
  <li>helping to ensure the transition is integrated into wider local transport and community needs</li>
</ul>

<p>The government acknowledges this is a new and complex area for local authorities. This can lead to actual or perceived barriers to a successful rollout of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging infrastructure.</p>

<p>This guidance provides resources for local authorities, linking to relevant government publications and support, and advice from relevant external bodies. It will be updated as new laws, regulations and examples of best practice develop.</p>

<h2>Role and importance of local authorities</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> Infrastructure strategy will set clear expectations for major stakeholders, including local authorities.</p>

<p>Local authorities are responsible for overarching planning policies in their areas, including street alternations and parking.</p>

<p>In Great Britain, they also own lampposts and bollards, which can be adapted to incorporate public charging, as already demonstrated in many areas.</p>

<p>Many local authorities also own local car parks, which can be adapted to include local charging infrastructure.</p>

<p>Importantly, local authorities understand the transport needs of their local population, which they should be considering as part of transportation planning.</p>

<p>Roles vary across tiers of local government along with powers and related competencies – and charging strategies vary between areas, based on local needs and contexts. Through policies and published strategies, local authorities can facilitate and help guide the market to deliver to meet the charging needs of residents, businesses and visitors.</p>

<p>Writing or being part of a wider local <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> or <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> infrastructure strategy is vital to establishing objectives, ways of working, responsibilities and a pathway to delivery.</p>

<p>Even in places where a two-tier structure exists, district and borough councils must work with the relevant Highways Authority on a coordinated strategy and delivery for <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints.</p>

<p>Leading areas often cite a coordinated suite of activities as being helpful to address the <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging needs of residents, businesses and visitors, for example:</p>

<h4>Publishing a long-term strategy to meet the <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging needs in a local authority or region</h4>
<p>This could include considering how best to align wider net zero policies, including those in transport and energy.</p>

<h4>Considering options to decarbonise vehicle fleets operating in the local area</h4>
<p>This could include implementing a plan to electrify local authority vehicles, supporting eCar clubs and the infrastructure needed for taxis and private hire vehicles to electrify.</p>

<h4>Engaging broadly with local business and the public</h4>
<p>This could include awareness-raising activities to ensure residents, businesses and visitors are aware of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging infrastructure, and ‘try before you buy’ vehicle schemes.</p>

<h2>Funding schemes</h2>

<h3>On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme</h3>

<p>A significant national and local policy challenge is how to ensure sufficient provision of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints for residents without private parking.</p>

<p>Available to all UK local authorities, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/grants-for-local-authorities-to-provide-residential-on-street-chargepoints/grants-to-provide-residential-on-street-chargepoints-for-plug-in-electric-vehicles-guidance-for-local-authorities">On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme</a> (<abbr title="On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme">ORCS</abbr>) provides funding towards the capital costs of installing public charging infrastructure for residents without private parking. It supports installations both on-street and in local authoritiy-owned residential car parks.</p>

<p>In the financial year 2022 to 2023, £20 million is available through <abbr title="On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme">ORCS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a local authority needs guidance or support to bid for <abbr title="On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme">ORCS</abbr> funding, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/grants-and-loans/street-residential-chargepoint-scheme" rel="external">Energy Saving Trust</a> (<abbr title="Energy Saving Trust">EST</abbr>) is funded by the government to provide free, impartial advice and feedback throughout the application stage.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/service/local-government-support-programme/" rel="external"><abbr title="Energy Saving Trust">EST</abbr>’s Local Government Support Programme</a> can also help.</p>

<h3>Local <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> Infrastructure Fund</h3>

<p>To be launched in full in the financial year 2022 to 2023, the £450 million Local <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> Infrastructure (LEVI) Fund will help local authorities leverage private sector investment into their local charging networks and put in place long-term, sustainable charging infrastructure.</p>

<p>To ensure the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-local-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-levi-pilot-funding">LEVI fund</a> is designed in a way to best support local authorities in delivery, we have launched a £10 million pilot.</p>

<h3>Workplace Charging Scheme</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants-installers-and-manufacturers/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants-chargepoint-installers-and-manufacturers">Workplace Charging Scheme</a> (<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>) can help local authorities to electrify their own fleets and help transition their staff to <abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>, supporting them in their environmental commitments.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> is a voucher-based scheme open to all local authorities. It provides support towards the upfront costs of the purchase and installation of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints that are dedicated to staff or fleet use. The scheme provides up to £350 for each chargepoint socket installed at a site, with applicants being able to receive up to 40 grants.</p>

<p>In 2022, the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> will be opened to small accommodation businesses and the charity sector. This will help to accelerate <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> uptake in rural areas and support the UK tourist industry.</p>

<p>Additional help will be provided to small- and medium-sized enterprises to fund their staff or fleet carparks.</p>

<p>A new fund, worth up to £15,000 per site, will also be created to boost the help government gives <abbr title="small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> to install chargepoints for their staff and fleets.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grants for homes</h3>

<p>We are reforming the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/customer-guidance-electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-guidance-for-customers">Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme</a> (<abbr title="Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>) to speed up the provision of chargepoints in flats and rental accommodation.</p>

<p>From the 1 April 2022, local authorities that own social housing will be able to apply to the EV chargepoint grant for landlords. This will provide grants of up to £350 towards the cost of purchasing and installing a chargepoint, with up to 200 grants a year available for each local authority.</p>

<p>Additional support will be available later in 2022 for local authorities to help install <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints in residential apartment block parking spaces. The <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for residential carparks will provide grants of up to £30,000 towards the cost of installing <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints in such properties.</p>

<h3>Rapid Charging Fund</h3>
<p>The £950 million <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rapid-charging-fund">Rapid Charging Fund</a> will ensure that there is an ultra rapid charging network along motorways and major A-roads ready to meet the long-term consumer demand for electric vehicle chargepoints ahead of need.</p>

<p>It will be available to fund a portion of costs at strategic sites where upgrading connections to the electricity grid is prohibitively expensive and uncommercial.</p>

<p>In the shorter term, we’re working with industry to ensure that every motorway service area in England has at least 6 ultra-rapid chargepoints by the end of 2023, including through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/decision-riio-ed1-green-recovery-scheme" rel="external">Green Recovery Scheme</a>, which is providing network upgrades at over 50 service stations.</p>
