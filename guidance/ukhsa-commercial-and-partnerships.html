<h2>How to engage with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>We are working to build an environment in which <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and companies can work effectively together and exchange ideas, knowledge and skills. We engage with industry in a variety of ways. Our events and activities provide opportunities for suppliers to establish productive relationships with industry experts, our programmes and delivery teams and members of the wider supply community.</p>

<p>We aim to run workshops throughout the year to share the plans and objectives of our programmes and to get feedback from industry on our approach and its impact on suppliers and the market. We will run working groups that contribute directly to our team’s work and will also run webinars and requests for information (<abbr title="requests for information">RFI</abbr>) because we understand that these help industries plan, prepare for potential opportunities and provide input into our products and services.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and government procurement policy</h2>

<h3>Social value</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/921437/PPN-06_20-Taking-Account-of-Social-Value-in-the-Award-of-Central-Government-Contracts.pdf" rel="external">Procurement Policy Note 06/20 – taking account of social value in the award of central government contracts</a></p>

<p>This note sets out how to take account of social value in the award of central government contracts by using the Social Value Model. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will use this model to take account of the additional social benefits that can be achieved in the delivery of its contracts, using policy outcomes aligned with this government’s priorities.</p>

<h3>Sustainability</h3>

<p>We practice sustainable procurement to achieve value for money while minimising environmental damage and waste.</p>

<h3>Integrity in business</h3>

<p>UK companies that do business with integrity are better positioned to reduce risks and capitalise on commercial opportunities. This means complying with the UK Bribery Act and ensuring local partners, agents and distributors adhere to the same high standards. It also means being vigilant for modern slavery and other human rights abuses, both in operations and supply chains, in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents/enacted" rel="external">UK Modern Slavery Act 2015</a>.</p>

<p>Companies that make integrity core to their business protect and strengthen brand reputation <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.u4.no/publications/the-relationship-between-business-integrity-and-commercial-success" rel="external">enjoy greater and more sustainable commercial success</a> over the long-term, minimising the risk of prosecution.</p>

<p>Tackling bribery and corruption creates more prosperous and healthy communities and a better business environment. It also enables the UK to maintain its status as a global leader in the fight against corruption.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> staff engaged in procurement have a duty to act in a professional and impartial manner and to be mindful of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents" rel="external">Bribery Act 2010</a>. We expect our suppliers to act in accordance with this.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Justice has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bribery-act-2010-guidance">extensive guidance on the Bribery Act</a>. Transparency International has also published guidance for business on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/resist_resisting_extortion_and_solicitation_in_international_transactions" rel="external">how to resist demands for bribes</a>.</p>
