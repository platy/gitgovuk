<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/latvia/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Latvia</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to stay in Latvia for longer than 3 consecutive months, you must register with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/home/services/residence-permits/#1">Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs (OCMA)</a>.</p>

<p>Once resident in Latvia you must also declare your place of residence. You can do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at your <a rel="external" href="http://www.lps.lv/lv/kontakti/pasvaldibu-kontakti/">local municipality</a> (in Latvian)</li>
  <li>at the <a rel="external" href="http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/home/services/residence-permits/#1">OCMA</a>

  <li>online through the <a rel="external" href="https://www.latvija.lv/epakalpojumi/ep15/apraksts">Public Administration Services Portal</a> (in Latvian)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, you will have to change your residence document for a new one before 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you already hold a residence document, a letter from OCMA that explains how to get a new document after Brexit will be sent to your declared place of residence in Latvia.</p>

<p>All residence documents that are issued before the UK leaves the EU, including eID cards or paper documents in A5 format, will be valid until 31 December 2020, unless the residence document is valid for a time period before that date.</p>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available. Sign up to our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-latvia">email alerts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Latvia.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/latvia">travel advice for Latvia</a> and sign up to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/latvia">email alerts</a> for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020.  During this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of the negotiations.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180-day period. You must retain evidence of travel (such as train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are a permanent resident of Latvia, you are entitled to the same healthcare as Latvian nationals. If you are a temporary resident and live in Latvia in connection with your employment or you are self-employed, you and your family members can receive state-funded healthcare services.</p>

<p>Read NHS guidance about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/Pages/healthcareinLatvia.aspx">healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Latvia</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Latvia and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You must apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Latvia, you must not use a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK for healthcare in Latvia.</p>

<p>When you travel from Latvia for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:â€¯</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return homeâ€¯</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insuranceâ€¯</li>
  <li>read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#brexit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>

</ul>

<p>If you are a student, read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/latvia-list-of-medical-facilities">English-speaking doctor in Latvia</a>.</p>

<p>You must also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal in Latvia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Latvia will remain the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, you will have the right to state funded healthcare until 31 December 2020 if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are employed or self-employed, in which case your family members will be entitled to the same healthcare services as you</li>
  <li>your healthcare is provided under the S1 form scheme</li>
  <li>you started your studies at university or college in Latvia before the day the UK leaves the EU, you will have access to state-funded healthcare for the duration of your studies</li>
</ul>

<p>If you currently have your healthcare costs paid for by the UK government, we can help if you are asked to pay for treatment during the first 6 months after Brexit. To organise a payment, you must give your healthcare providerâ€™s details to the NHS Business Services Authorityâ€™s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid if thereâ€™s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme if thereâ€™s no deal. However, this is reliant on Latvia continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>Read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-latvia/">healthcare for UK nationals in Latvia and how it may change after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-latvia">Working in Latvia</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may need you to apply for a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records check</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer will need to apply to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.vid.gov.lv/en">State Revenue Service</a> for your unique tax code. If you already have a personal code in Latvia, they will use this. Your employer is responsible for deducting your income tax and social security payments from your income.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed, you must register with the tax authorities yourself. You will be responsible for calculating and paying your tax and social security contributions.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-latvia-after-brexit">Working in Latvia after Brexit</h3>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/latvia-providing-services-after-eu-exit">guidance on providing services after Brexit</a> if you are planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after Brexit.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, your right to work will not change until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal and you enter Latvia after Brexit, rules for third country nationals will apply for working in Latvia.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Latvia to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<p>If the end date on your form is after 31 October 2019, you should contact theâ€¯relevant EU, EEA or Swiss authorityâ€¯to confirm whether you need to start paying social security contributions in that country after 31 October, as well as UK National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-brexit">Money and tax after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is no deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the EU.

<p>Brexit will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Latvia. You should send your taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Latvia. 
Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/latvia-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer</a> in Latvia.</p>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire to Latvia, you can claim:</p>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a life certificate from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">UK Pension Service</a>, you must respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you donâ€™t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-brexit">Pensions after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay a State Pension to those eligible in the EU after Brexit. Your UK State Pension will be uprated in April 2020, 2021 and 2022 if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland.</p>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Latvia you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Latvian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

</ul>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit cannot be paid to you if youâ€™re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time youâ€™ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1117&langId=en">Latvian social security benefits</a> if you have made enough social security contributions in Latvia.</p>

<p>To get benefits you must have a residence document and be living in Latvia for employment or family reasons.</p>
