<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/latvia/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Latvia</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to stay in Latvia for longer than 3 consecutive months, you must register with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/home/services/residence-permits/#1">Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs (OCMA)</a>.</p>

<p>Once resident in Latvia you must also declare your place of residence. You can do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at your <a rel="external" href="http://www.lps.lv/lv/kontakti/pasvaldibu-kontakti/">local municipality</a>
</li>
  <li>at the <a rel="external" href="http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/home/services/residence-permits/#1">OCMA</a>
</li>
  <li>online through the <a rel="external" href="https://www.latvija.lv/epakalpojumi/ep15/apraksts">Public Administration Services Portal</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="residency-and-visas-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency and visas after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You will need to change your residence document for a new one before 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you already hold a residence document, a letter from OCMA that explains how to get a new document after EU Exit will be sent to your declared place of residence in Latvia.</p>

<p>All residence documents that are issued before the UK leaves the EU, including eID cards or paper documents in A5 format, will be valid until 31 December 2020, unless the residence document is valid for a time period before that date.</p>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available. You should sign up to our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-latvia">email alerts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Latvia. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<p>You can look at our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/latvia">travel advice for Latvia</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be new travel rules.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission has said <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6402_en.htm">you may not need visas for short stays</a> elsewhere in the Schengen area or the EU. You may be able to stay up to 90 days in any EU country, within a 180 day period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are a permanent resident of Latvia, you are entitled to the same healthcare as Latvian nationals. If you are a temporary resident and live in Latvia in connection with your employment or you are self-employed, you and your family members can receive state funded healthcare services.</p>

<p>The NHS has more information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/Pages/healthcareinLatvia.aspx">healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Latvia</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Latvia and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Latvia, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Latvia.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/latvia-list-of-medical-facilities">find an English-speaking doctor in Latvia</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal in Latvia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Latvia will remain the same until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you will have the right to state funded healthcare until 31 December 2020 if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are employed or self-employed, in which case your family members will be entitled to the same healthcare services as you</li>
  <li>your healthcare is provided  under the S1 form scheme</li>
  <li>you started your studies at university or college in Latvia before the day the UK leaves the EU, you will have access to state funded healthcare for the duration of your studies</li>
</ul>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal, however this is reliant on Latvia continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-latvia">Working in Latvia</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may need you to <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">apply for a UK criminal records check</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer will need to apply to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.vid.gov.lv/en">State Revenue Service</a> for your unique tax code. If you already have a personal code in Latvia, they will use this. Your employer is responsible for deducting your income tax and social security payments from your income.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed, you must register with the tax authorities yourself. You will be responsible for calculating and paying your tax and social security contributions.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-latvia-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Latvia after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If you are e planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/latvia-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves with a deal, your right to work will not change until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal and you enter Latvia after the UK leaves the EU, rules for third country nationals will apply for working in Latvia. You should read <a rel="external" href="http://workinlatvia.liaa.gov.lv/">the Latvian government’s guide</a> on working in Latvia as a citizen of countries outside the EU and European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Latvia to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU.</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the EU. You can read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial service in the EU.</a>.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Latvia. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Latvia. Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/latvia-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer</a> in Latvia.</p>

<p>You can also seek professional advice at the <a rel="external" href="http://www.lrga.lv/en/contacts">Latvian Association of Accountants</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire to Latvia, you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">UK State Pension</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension">new UK State Pension</a>. Contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension Centre</a> to claim</li>
  <li>your <a rel="external" href="https://www.vsaa.gov.lv/en/">Latvian pension</a>, if you have worked in Latvia</li>
  <li>

</ul>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a ‘life certificate’ from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">UK Pension Service</a>, you must respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay State Pension, child benefits and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU. Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Latvia you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Latvian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Latvia. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to check which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">UK benefits you might be able to get while you’re abroad</a> and how to claim them</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit cannot be paid to you.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time you’ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="latvian-benefits">Latvian benefits</h3>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1117&langId=en">Latvian social security benefits</a> if you have made enough social security contributions in Latvia.</p>

<p>To get benefits you must have a residence document and be living in Latvia for employment or family reasons.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.vsaa.lv/en/">State Social Security Agency</a> has more information.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK Government will continue to pay child benefits and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Latvia, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Latvian contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.csdd.lv/en/obtaining-and-exchange-of-driving-licence/obtaining-and-exchange-of-driving-licence">exchange your UK licence for a Latvian driving licence</a> before the UK leaves the EU, as your UK licence may no longer be valid after the UK leaves the EU.
