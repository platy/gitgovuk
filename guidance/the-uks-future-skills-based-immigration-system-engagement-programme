<p>Home Secretary Sajid Javid set out our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-announces-new-skills-based-immigration-system">plans for a new single, skills-based immigration system</a> replacing free movement in a white paper published on Wednesday 19 December 2018.</p>

<p>The future system will support a dynamic economy in line with the UK’s Industrial Strategy which aims for a skilled, innovative and highly productive workforce. We will have full control of migration to serve the national interest, and to enable those who come to the UK to integrate and make a positive contribution to the economy and society.</p>

<p>The proposals provide a platform for discussion with private, public and voluntary sector employers, as well as industry representatives. We will communicate our plan for a skills-based system and gather views on specific details before the final policy is agreed.</p>

<p>A programme of engagement in 2019 is being delivered across the UK and internationally through a series of events and advisory groups.</p>

<p>The new immigration system will be implemented in a phased approach from January 2021.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://gov.smartwebportal.co.uk/homeoffice/public/webform.asp?id=151&id2=2E3F45">Sign up for email updates</a> on the future immigration system, including the development of our proposals.</p>

<h2 id="business-sectors">Business sectors</h2>

<p>We have extensive existing links with employers and industry representatives to support the development of policy across government departments.</p>

<p>Many of these existing forums will have a session on the technical detail of the proposals. Members will have the opportunity to share the needs of their sector to help shape the policy and design of the future system.</p>

<p>Employers or industry representatives interested in participating in these forums should contact their government sector lead.</p>

<h2 id="uk-wide-engagement">UK-wide engagement</h2>

<p>We are committed to designing a future borders and immigration systems that works for every part of the UK. We will bring together business leaders, employers, civic groups and local government in each nation.</p>

<p>We will build on existing business-led forums, for example in England the Local Enterprise Partnerships network provides local businesses with a platform to feed into national policy making.</p>

<p>We are also working with business representative organisations across the UK to deliver a series of roundtables with their members.</p>

<p>The government will work with the devolved administrations to understand their unique perspectives and challenges and to ensure that employers have the flexibility they need to deploy staff and that individuals are able to visit, live and work in all parts of the UK.</p>

<h2 id="advisory-groups">Advisory groups</h2>

<p>These groups will have ongoing discussions over 2019 on policy, system design and implementation. The groups will meet on a regular basis and explore in detail the contents of the proposals.</p>

<p>Each advisory group has been designed to bring together stakeholders most suited to discuss the following policy areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employers</li>
  <li>education</li>
  <li>crossing the border</li>
  <li>vulnerability</li>
  <li>national</li>
</ul>

<p>The national group will bring together representative organisations from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to ensure our work delivers on the commitment to design a UK-wide system.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-future-skills-based-immigration-system-advisory-group-membership">membership list</a> of the UK’s future skills-based immigration system advisory groups.</p>
