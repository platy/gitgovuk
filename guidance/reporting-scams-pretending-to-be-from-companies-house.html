<h2>Scam telephone calls</h2>

<h3>Late filing penalty payment</h3>

<p>Companies have been contacted asking for payment of a late filing penalty over the telephone. The caller says they’ll accept a payment of £5 by credit or debit to place a hold on any further action being taken.</p>

<p>We will not contact you for immediate payment of a late filing penalty or request payment of a nominal fee to place a hold on any recovery action.</p>

<p>Payment plans are set up with the agreement of the manager dealing with your late filing penalty query. We will not cold call you to take a payment.</p>

<h3>Asking for your authentication code</h3>

<p>We’ll never ask you what your authentication code is over the phone.</p>

<p>If anyone calls you claiming to be from Companies House asking for your authentication code - try to get a return telephone number and contact us immediately on 0303 1234 500.</p>

<h3>Asking for directors’ details</h3>

<p>Companies have been telephoned by people claiming to be from Companies House, who request details of their company’s directors.</p>

<p>After being advised there’s a discrepancy with the information held on the register, the caller requests information such as full dates of birth for directors.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>We’ll never contact you by telephone to find out who your officers are, or ask for secure information.</p>
</div>

<p>If anyone calls you claiming to be from Companies House asking for this information - try to get a return telephone number and contact us immediately on 0303 1234 500.</p>

<h2>Scam emails</h2>

<p>We’re aware of suspicious emails being sent that claim to be from Companies House.</p>

<p>Some emails might have an attachment, such as a Word document, and may ask you to enter an authorisation code. These emails have not been generated by us.</p>

<p>If you receive a suspicious email, you should report it to us immediately at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk">phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Do not disclose any personal information or open any attachments. Companies House will never ask for your authentication code.</p>
</div>

<h3>Phishing scam with subject line ‘Hundreds of phone calls and emails have been sent in the name of your company – Notice #’</h3>

<p>This scam email claims that hundreds of phonecalls and emails have been sent in your company name. It also asks customers to click a link to see what type of information has been sent. These emails are not from us.</p>

<p>If you’ve received one of these emails forward it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk">phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> and delete it from all mailboxes, including your deleted items.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

<h3>Phishing scam asking to verify your identity</h3>

<h3>Scam company complaints emails</h3>

<p>Some customers have received suspicious emails about company complaints. These emails are not from us.</p>

<p>If you receive any emails from this sender, forward them to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk">phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This message has been generated in response to the company complaint submitted to Companies House WebFiling service.</p>

<h3>Investigations and Enforcement Services emails</h3>

<p>Since 2016, we’ve seen emails claiming to be from the ‘Investigations and Enforcement Services at Companies House’. The email says it’s automatically generated in response to a complaint about a company.</p>

<p>Customers are asked to view an attached document. This document has been shown to contain malware - do not open this attachment.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/111682/Scam_email_example_2.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Do not click any links or try to view any attachments contained in the email.</p>
</div>

<h3>Scam ‘Document Order’ emails</h3>

<p>These emails appear to come from a valid Companies House email address but do not.</p>

<p>You’ll only get a document order email if you’ve requested a copy of current company information using our online filing service.</p>

<p>Genuine document order emails contain your company name and number under the ‘Order detail’ heading, and a reference to the attached PDF of company information.</p>

<p>The scam emails do not contain this individual company information, and the attachment is not in a PDF format. Do not open the attachment.</p>

<p>If you’ve received one of these emails forward it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk">phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> and then delete it.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Do not try to view any attachments contained in the email.</p>
</div>

<h3>Scam online filing submission emails</h3>

<p>This scam email claims to be a response to an online filing submission.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/111680/Scam_email_example.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>We’re also aware that some customers have been sent emails with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Thank you for completing a submission Reference # (0516538). Check attachment to confirm acceptance or rejection of this filing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do not open an attachment to check information.</p>

<p>In any emails from us, we’ll tell you within the body of the email whether your submission has been accepted or rejected.</p>

<p>If you’ve received one of these fake emails, forward it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk">phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> and then delete it.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Do not try to view any attachments contained in the email.</p>
</div>

<h3>Scam eReminder requests for accounts</h3>

<p>Some people have reported receiving phishing emails in the form of an email reminder to submit accounts.</p>

<p>The examples we’ve been shown have an incorrect due date on them. This is your first indication it might be a scam.</p>

<p>The phishing emails also say ‘Please find information in the following link regarding your Company’s annual accounts.’</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Do not click this link, as it transfers you to ‘118enquiries.com’ and downloads a zip-file onto your device.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’ve received one of these emails forward it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk">phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> and then delete it.</p>

<h3>Scam requests to verify your Companies House password</h3>

<p>We’ve had reports of people receiving email requests to validate their Companies House email address and password.</p>

<p>If you’re not expecting to receive an email to reset your password it may be a scam. Forward it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk">phishing@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> and then delete it.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/111681/Phishing_scam_email.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>The email contains a link to a web page that requests the entry of your email address and password.</p>

<p>Always check that the URL (the website address) you’re about to visit is a genuine Companies House or GOV.UK address.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
A request for a password reset for our online filing service will have an address that starts: ewf.companieshouse.gov.uk</p>
</div>

<p>If the link doesn’t contain ‘.gov.uk’ within the address - it’s not a Companies House page and could be a scam.</p>

<p>Do not enter any details or click any links or buttons. The web page is not linked to our services and could send your details to the scammers.</p>

<h2>Scam letters</h2>

<h3>Letters from prosecuting solicitors asking for payment</h3>

<p>We’re aware of a scam letter that appears to be from Companies House prosecuting solicitors.</p>

<p>It asks for payment into a bank account to clear an outstanding invoice for ‘prior penalty negotiations’. We do not issue these letters.</p>

<p>If you receive a suspicious letter, contact us immediately on 0303 1234 500. Never pay any money into the bank account shown.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/111683/Scam_invoice_1.jpg"></div></figure>

<h3>Scam invoice asking for payment for company registration</h3>

<p>We’ve had reports of the following invoice claiming to be from Companies House.</p>

<p>It asks for payment of a balance shown in dollars, and is addressed from ‘Government Digital Service, Caroline Street, Birmingham’. These invoices are not from Companies House.</p>

<p>If you receive a suspicious invoice, contact us immediately on 0303 1234 500. Never pay any money to the sender.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/111684/Scam_invoice_2.jpg"></div></figure>

<h2>Suspicious job vacancies</h2>

<p>We’re receiving email enquiries about job adverts in the UK.</p>

<p>These adverts generally offer highly paid vacancies or opportunities in the oil, hotel or banking industries. The job adverts are often placed in print or on websites to appear genuine.</p>

<p>Treat all job offers with extreme caution. The contact details are usually fake, and you should avoid replying to the providers of these vacancies.</p>

<p>The advert might request money up front before the application can be processed, and they might also mention UK visas. Be sure to check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration">UK Visas and Immigration</a> for information on applying for a UK visa.</p>

<p>You can search for genuine job vacancies at Companies House on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">civil service jobs website</a>.</p>

<h2>Pension liberation scams</h2>

<p>Pension scams are on the increase in the UK and under some schemes individuals have had limited companies set up in their name.</p>

<p>If you believe you’ve had a company set up in your name, seek legal advice before taking any action to close it.</p>

<p>Scams are promoted using terms such as an offer of unique investment opportunities, free pension review, legal loophole, cash bonus or as a government endorsed scheme and victims are being approached through cold calling, text message or in person door to door.</p>

<p>You should treat all approaches about your pension with caution if it is not from a source you recognise and trust.</p>

<p>If you’re approached, do not share your personal information or sign any paperwork.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/taking-payments-from-your-pension-pot/pension-scams" rel="external">The Pension Advisory Service</a> can help you check if the offer of service is genuine.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/pension-scams.aspx" rel="external">The Pensions Regulator</a> offers guidance to help individuals who think that they may have been targeted by pension scams.</p>

<h2>Company register payment requests</h2>

<p>Companies registered at Companies House are receiving notifications asking for money to maintain their company on a register.</p>

<p>The companies concerned are receiving what looks like a genuine request from one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Companies Register</li>
  <li>Digital Companies Register</li>
  <li>National Register of Companies</li>
  <li>Economic Index for Europe</li>
  <li>Register of Companies and Businesses</li>
  <li>Scottish Commercial Register (publication of companies)</li>
  <li>Welsh Commercial Register</li>
  <li>e-public.co.uk Company Register</li>
  <li>regist.co.uk</li>
</ul>

<p>These organisations are not connected to, or endorsed by, either Companies House or GOV.UK and the fee requested is not required to keep the company registered at Companies House.</p>
