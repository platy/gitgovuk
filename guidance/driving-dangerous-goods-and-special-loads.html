<p>Hauliers must be aware of the laws on transporting dangerous goods by road, and the procedures involved in classifying such goods.</p>

<p>This guide gives an overview of these rules. It also covers how to make sure that vehicles carrying these goods, and their operators, are correctly certified in line with international regulations.</p>

<h2>The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (<abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Moving dangerous goods by road is governed by international regulations and is strictly policed. Most European countries are signed up to <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>. Each country that complies with <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> implements specific safety measures through its own national legislation.</p>

<p><abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> ensures that any dangerous goods transported by road can cross international borders freely if the goods, vehicles and drivers comply with its rules.</p>

<p><abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> has been in force since 1968 and is administered by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (<abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr>). Itâ€™s updated every 2 years to take account of technological advances.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

</ul>
</div>

<p>Annex A to <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> sets out the requirements for classifying, packaging, labelling and certifying dangerous goods.</p>

<p>Vehicles carrying dangerous goods must comply with Annex B to <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>, which includes vehicle and tank specifications and other operational requirements.</p>

<p>Drivers of all vehicles carrying dangerous goods must have an <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> training certificate. There are exemptions for drivers carrying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>small loads below the threshold limits</li>
  <li>dangerous goods packed in limited quantities</li>
  <li>dangerous goods packed in excepted quantities</li>
</ul>

<p>You must register as a waste carrier to transport certain types of dangerous waste.</p>

<h3>Exemptions</h3>

<p>If you transport dangerous goods loads that are below certain volumes or weights, many parts of <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> may not apply, or only apply in a modified form.</p>

<p>General exemptions are listed in chapter 1.1.3. part 3 of Annex A to <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>. It includes the dangerous goods list, special provisions and exemptions related to dangerous goods packed in limited quantities.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/cdg" rel="external">Read about dangerous goods UK regulations on the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health &amp; Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<h3>Countries where <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> applies</h3>

<p>On the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> website, see a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/adr/country-info_e.htm" rel="external">full list of the competent authorities applying <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation required to carry dangerous goods</h2>

<p>When transporting dangerous goods internationally under <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>, you must ensure that your loads are always accompanied by a transport document. This sets out detailed information on the load being carried, including full classification of any substances carried and how to package them. You must present the required information in a certain order and follow certain rules on language.</p>

<p>In addition to documents required under other regulations, under <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> you must ensure that the following documents are carried on the transport unit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transport documents containing prescribed information for each dangerous substance, material or article being carried</li>
  <li>emergency instructions in writing</li>
  <li>means of identification, including a photograph of each member of the vehicle crew</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unece.org/index.php?id=50858&amp;no_cache=1" rel="external">Download <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> 2019 from the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> website for full documentation instructions</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, if any part of your journey involves sea transport of the vehicle, see this information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-dangerous-goods#regulations-for-transporting-dangerous-goods-by-air-sea-road-and-rail-transport">moving goods by sea</a>.</p>

<h3>Emergency instructions in writing</h3>

<p>The consignor of a vehicle carrying dangerous goods must provide the driver with details of the hazards associated with their dangerous goods loads and instructions on emergency action to take if an accident occurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before a journey commences, the driver/haulier must provide the instructions in writing (rather than the consignor)</li>
  <li>the instructions must be in languages that every member of the vehicleâ€™s driver/crew understand</li>
  <li>one set of instructions - based on a 4 page model - covers all dangerous goods rather than specific products</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other agreements and legislation which may apply to dangerous loads</h3>

<p>Some exceptions or â€˜derogationsâ€™ from the provisions of <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> are allowed under certain multilateral agreements. These allow goods to be transported - usually for a fixed period - between or through any of the countries that have signed up to the multilateral agreement. If you are carrying dangerous goods under such an agreement, you must carry a copy of that agreement. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/multi/multi.htm#m85" rel="external">check whether a multilateral agreement applies to your load and route on the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>You should also check whether other legislation beyond the <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> applies to the dangerous goods you carry - for example, load restrictions on the carriage of petrol.</p>

<h2>The dangerous goods vehicle approval certificate</h2>

<p>To carry explosives or dangerous goods in tanks by road to or through countries which apply <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>, you may need to obtain a certificate under Annex B of <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unece.org/index.php?id=50858&amp;no_cache=1" rel="external">view requirements of <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> 2019 on construction and approval of vehicles on the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Fixed-tank vehicles, tank-battery vehicles and other vehicles carrying explosives must undergo technical inspection and a certification procedure in their country of registration to make sure that they conform with <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> requirements and to the standard safety regulations in force, for example covering brakes, lighting and steering.</p>

<p>In the UK, vehicles can be inspected at certain Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) Goods Vehicle Testing Stations. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> issues a certificate of approval, valid for one year, for vehicles that pass this inspection. Vehicle operators must pay a fee for the inspection.</p>

<p>For more information, see the guide on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist-tests-for-lorries/the-adr-test"><abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> and other tests for dangerous or hazardous goods vehicles</a>.</p>

<h2>Driver training certificates required under <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Under <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>, drivers of vehicles with tanks and certain tank components, and some drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods in packages, must hold a special vocational certificate of training, sometimes referred to informally as an â€˜<abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> Certificateâ€™.</p>

<p>All drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods must attend an approved basic training course. These courses equip drivers with information and tools so that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are aware of the hazards in the carriage of dangerous goods</li>
  <li>can take steps to reduce the likelihood of an incident taking place</li>
  <li>can take all necessary measures for their own safety and that of the public and the environment to limit the effects of any incident that does occur</li>
  <li>have individual practical experience of the actions they will need to take</li>
</ul>

<p>For more details on the different crew training requirements see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unece.org/index.php?id=50858&amp;no_cache=1" rel="external">chapter 8.2 of <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> on the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> test required to certify vehicles used to transport dangerous goods</h2>

<p>Vehicles used to transport dangerous or hazardous goods must undergo annual checks to certify that they are roadworthy.</p>

<p>Certain dangerous goods vehicles must have an extra test and certificate over and above the normal heavy goods vehicle roadworthiness test. This is known informally as an â€˜<abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> testâ€™. It ensures that vehicles comply with part 9 of <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>. Vehicle requirements vary according to the nature of the goods being carried.</p>

<h3>How to book your annual <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> dangerous goods vehicle test</h3>

<p>Dangerous goods vehicle tests can be done at all <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> test stations. An <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> vehicle test can be done at the same time as the annual test, for an extra fee.</p>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/certificate-for-carriage-of-dangerous-goods-vtg-15">complete a VTG15 form for any vehicles undergoing <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> certification testing</a> to certify that your vehicle is carrying dangerous goods.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unece.org/index.php?id=50858&amp;no_cache=1" rel="external">read the UN official publication of <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> 2019 on the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2>Requirements for the carriage of dangerous goods on vehicles at sea</h2>

<p>The carriage of dangerous goods in vehicles on ships is governed in UK law by the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods and Marine Pollutants) Regulations 1997. These regulations enact the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (<abbr title="International Maritime Dangerous Goods">IMDG</abbr>) code established by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The <abbr title="International Maritime Dangerous Goods">IMDG</abbr> code covers the carriage of goods, which have been classified as dangerous if transported by sea, or are a marine pollutant.</p>

<p>The â€˜Blue Bookâ€™ referred to in previous guidance no longer exists. It has been replaced by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/merchant-shipping-notices-msns">Merchant Shipping Notices (<abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notices">MSNs</abbr>)</a>, which are issued by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (<abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr>). <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notices">MSNs</abbr> cover mandatory information that must be complied with under UK legislation. These <abbr title="Merchant Shipping Notices">MSNs</abbr> relate to legal requirements and contain the technical detail of such regulations.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-of-dangerous-goods-drivers-checklist">download a driversâ€™ checklist</a>.</p>

<h3>Guidelines for packing dangerous cargo in freight containers</h3>

<p>The IMO publishes guidelines for packing cargo in freight containers or vehicles, as a supplement to the <abbr title="International Maritime Dangerous Goods">IMDG</abbr> code. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Cargoes/DangerousGoods/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">read about the code together with its supplements on the IMO website</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Maritime and Coastguard Agency">MCA</abbr> publishes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/transporting-dangerous-goods-by-sea-m-notices">help and advice on the carriage of dangerous goods in ships</a>.</p>

<h2>Attending an inland border facility (IBF)</h2>

<p>Inland border facilities may not allow a vehicle to enter if itâ€™s carrying certain types of goods, for example hazardous goods.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/attending-an-inland-border-facility">You should check details of excluded goods or vehicles before you attend an inland border facility</a>.</p>

<h2>Appointing a dangerous goods safety adviser</h2>

<p>Companies engaged in carrying, packing, filling,&nbsp;loading and/or&nbsp;unloading of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways may have to appoint a dangerous goods safety adviser (<abbr title="Dangerous Goods Safety Adviser">DGSA</abbr>) to comply with <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Dangerous Goods Safety Adviser">DGSA</abbr> requirements and their role are explained in chapter 1.8.3 of <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before an <abbr title="The European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road">ADR</abbr> vehicle inspection is carried out, fixed tanks, demountable tanks, vehicles carrying batteries of receptacles and tank containers must be examined and tested by an inspection body approved by the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>). To get the appropriate certificates, your tank equipment will have to meet certain design, construction and equipment standards.</p>
