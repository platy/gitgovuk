<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>

<h2 id="brexit-healthcare">Healthcare in Italy after Brexit</h2>

<p>You should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national living in or visiting Italy.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no arrangements with Italy in place. For example, if you are a posted worker or student using a <a href="#ehic">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a> you will not be able to use this to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-live-in-italy">If you live in Italy</h3>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-italy#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Italy</a></li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Italy</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>

<p>S1 certificates may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Italy and might mean you need to pay in full for your treatment.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-italy-after-brexit">Studying in Italy after Brexit</h3>

<p><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHICs</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Italy and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Italy before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<p>You can purchase full medical coverage from the Italian national health system itself, which will cost €150 per year.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK if you are living in Italy and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>You may use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge when visiting the UK after exit day if you are living in Italy on exit day and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>This will remain the case after exit day.</p>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="ehic">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHICs</abbr> may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Italy and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Italy.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need. If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="arrangement-with-italy-if-there-is-a-no-deal-brexit">Arrangement with Italy if there is a no-deal Brexit</h3>

<p>The Italian government has passed <a rel="external" href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2019/05/24/19G00049/sg">legislation if there is a no-deal Brexit</a>. This would give a commitment to continue current healthcare arrangements for UK nationals in Italy until 31 December 2020, as long as reciprocal arrangements are put in place for Italian nationals in the UK.</p>

<p>UK nationals living or working in Italy for more than 3 months must register as a resident and apply for access to the same healthcare entitlements as Italian nationals.</p>

<p>If you are registered with the Italian national health system (<abbr title="Sistema Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr>), you are entitled to the same access to healthcare as Italian nationals including emergency care and free-of-charge hospital admission.</p>

<h3 id="uk-posted-workers">UK posted workers</h3>

<p>If you are a worker posted by a UK company to Italy, you may be entitled to health cover funded by the UK in the country you are posted to. You can find out more from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>

<p>If you live in Italy, you may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>A S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Italy. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you are a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-italy">Foreign and Commonwealth Office (<abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>)</a> provides information about what UK and Italian benefits are available to Britons living in Italy.</p>

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in Italy at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free if you are staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Make sure you are treated by a healthcare provider in the state system. You will not be covered for private healthcare with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Italy if you have a pre-existing health condition. You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>The Money and Pensions Advice Service has information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions">buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medicine with you.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If you are travelling to have planned medical treatment, read the NHS guide on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">seeking medical treatment in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-services-in-italy">Healthcare services in Italy</h2>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>

<p>Call 118 for the ambulance service if you have a serious life-threatening emergency.</p>

<p>In some Italian cities you can also use the European emergency phone number, 112. These numbers are free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>

<p>You can access the A&E unit in state-funded Italian hospitals for medical emergencies.</p>

<p>In general, you need to be referred by a doctor for any hospital treatment. Check that you are referred to a state hospital as only these provide treatment covered by your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are admitted to hospital, you must present your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to ensure you only pay the patient contribution. Check you are not treated as a private patient.</p>

<p>You can find primary medical services at local health authorities, called Azienda Sanitaria Locale (<abbr title="Azienda Sanitaria Locale">ASL</abbr>). This includes GP and paediatrician services. These are free-of-charge consultations for residents registered with the Sistema Sanitario Nazionale (<abbr title="Sistema Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr>), the national health system.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>

<p>You will normally need to pay for prescriptions separately, even if you are registered with the <abbr title="Sistema Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr> – unless you have a special exemption registered with the <abbr title="Azienda Sanitaria Locale">ASL</abbr> based on your age, unemployment or a chronic medical condition.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-own-medicines-to-italy">Bringing your own medicines to Italy</h2>

<p>Some prescribed medicines contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in the UK. This means that extra legal controls apply to these medicines.</p>

<p>You may need a personal licence to take controlled medicines abroad.</p>

<p>Specific requirements also apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the information that you must take with you</li>
  <li>how you carry your controlled medicines</li>
</ul>
