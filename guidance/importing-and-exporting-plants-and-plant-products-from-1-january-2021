<h2 id="exporting-plants-and-plant-products-from-england-scotland-or-wales-to-the-eu">Exporting plants and plant products from England, Scotland or Wales to the EU</h2>
<p>From 1 January 2021, all regulated plants and plant products exported from England, Scotland or Wales to the EU will be subject to EU import controls in line with goods exported from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Regulated plants and plant products include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all plants for planting</li>
  <li>root and tubercle vegetables;</li>
  <li>most fruits</li>
  <li>cut flowers</li>
  <li>some seeds</li>
  <li>leafy vegetables</li>
  <li>machinery or vehicles which have been operated for agricultural or forestry purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>The process for sending regulated plants and plant products to the EU will be the same as the current process for sending them to third countries. When you export regulated plants and plant products to third countries, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check whether a <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr> is required by contacting the plant health authority or a plant health inspector in the destination country</li>
  <li>apply for a <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr> from the relevant UK plant health authority before export</li>
  <li>check if your plants require laboratory testing of samples to ensure they are free from pests and diseases or inspections during the growing season - contact your local plant health inspector to find out if your plants need these tests before exporting</li>
</ul>

<p>Growing season inspections which you need to apply for a phytosanitary certificate will remain unchanged from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The export health certificate online (EHCO) system will be live in 2021. You must submit your applications on EHCO.</p>

<p>Regulated plant and plant products exports to the EU from the UK may be subject to checks at the EU border.</p>

<h2 id="exempt-plants-and-plant-products-for-export">Exempt plants and plant products for export</h2>

<p>These plants and plant products are already exempt from controls to export to  EU member states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pineapple</li>
  <li>coconut</li>
  <li>durian</li>
  <li>bananas</li>
  <li>dates</li>
</ul>

<p>They will continue to be exempt from export controls after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Plant products such as fruit and vegetables that have been processed and packaged to the point that they no longer pose a biosecurity risk, will also be exempt from controls in EU member states.</p>

<p>Composite products like nut and seed butters containing processed fruit or vegetables do not fall within plant health controls or require a phytosanitary certificate.</p>

<h2 id="exporting-prohibited-and-high-risk-plants">Exporting prohibited and high-risk plants</h2>
<p>From 1  January 2021, you cannot export some prohibited commodities such as UK high-risk plants, seed potatoes and ware potatoes to the EU.</p>

<p>These prohibitions and requirements fall into 3 categories: high-risk plants, seed and other propagating materials, and prohibited plants.</p>

<h3 id="high-risk-plants">High-risk plants</h3>
<p>These are plants and plant products that have been assessed by the EU as presenting a pest risk of an unacceptable level for the Union territory.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/smarter-rules-for-safer-food-how-to-import-from-third-countries#high-risk-plants" class="govuk-link">full list of high-risk plants</a>.</p>

<p>The high-risk plant list is continually reviewed by the UK and the EU. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will publish any updates to the list in this guide.</p>

<h3 id="seed-and-other-propagating-material-requiring-third-country-equivalence">Seed and other propagating material requiring third country equivalence</h3>
<p>You cannot export seed and other propagating material to the EU from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3 id="prohibited-plants">Prohibited plants</h3>
<p>Some plants will be prohibited on plant health grounds,  including current EU third country prohibitions.</p>

<h2 id="steps-to-take-now-to-prepare-for-1-january-2021-1">Steps to take now to prepare for 1 January 2021</h2>
<p>To prepare for 1 January 2021 you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check with the relevant UK plant health authority to find out if plants and plant products you intend to export to the EU from 1 January 2021 need to be accompanied by a <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>check with the relevant plant health authority and GOV.UK guidance to find out if plants and plant products you intend to export to the EU from 1 January 2021 are classified as prohibited or high-risk plants</li>
  <li>check with the relevant UK plant health authority to find out if plants and plant products you intend to export to the EU require growing season inspections to apply for a phytosanitary certificate</li>
  <li>use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-plants-seeds-bulbs-and-wood-special-rules" class="govuk-link">export plants, seeds, bulbs and wood guidance</a> on EU plant health import requirements to help you prepare your export correctly</li>
  <li>register with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-as-a-professional-operator-to-issue-plant-passports" class="govuk-link">Forestry Commission as a professional operator</a> if youâ€™re exporting wood or wood products from England and Wales  - exporters in <a rel="external" href="https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/topics/plant-and-tree-health" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland</a> should refer to local guidance</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="move-regulated-plant-material-from-1-january-2021">Move regulated plant material from 1 January 2021</h2>
<p>If youâ€™re already authorised to issue plant passports, you do not need a new authorisation to issue UK plant passports.</p>

<p>You must renew your authorisations every year through an audit inspection to check for compliance. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate" class="govuk-link">Contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> to renew your authorisation each year.</p>

<p>You cannot attach UK plant passports in the EU. EU plant passports cannot be attached in England, Scotland or Wales (Great Britain).</p>

<p>An operator in the EU cannot issue a UK plant passport under GB plant health rules. A UK plant passport will be used for movements in GB under GB health rules from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, Northern Ireland will belong to a different sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) zone.</p>

<h2 id="plant-passport-changes">Plant passport changes</h2>
<p>Plant passports are changing in different ways from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3 id="content-and-format">Content and format</h3>
<p>The content and format will change to differentiate UK plant passports from EU plant passports. The EU plant passport will no longer be recognised as an official label in GB.</p>

<p>UK passports will have these changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there will be no flag</li>
  <li>the words â€˜Plant Passportâ€™ will change to â€˜UK Plant Passportâ€™</li>
  <li>Section B (registration number) will no longer have aâ€˜GBâ€™ prefix because this was only necessary on EU plant passports to differentiate between member states</li>
  <li>Section D (country of origin) will remain the same except for some plants for which the UK has <a href="#country-of-origin" class="govuk-link">national measures</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Section A (botanical names) and Section C (traceability codes) will remain the same.</p>

<p>Find out the <a href="#changes-to-protected-zone-plant-passports" class="govuk-link">changes to Protected Zone plant passports</a>.</p>

<p>Where a plant passport is combined with a certification label, the only changes to the plant passport section will be the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>removal of the EU flag</li>
  <li>words â€˜Plant Passportâ€™ replaced with â€˜UK Plant Passportâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>For some fruit and vegetable propagating material and some ornamental material you may also need a supplier document in addition to the UK plant passport. This is an existing requirement and will remain in place after 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/issuing-plant-passports-to-trade-plants-in-the-eu#supplier-document" class="govuk-link">making a supplier document for certain plants</a>.</p>

<p>Old EU plant passport labels will remain valid if in circulation before 1 January 2021. From 1 January 2021, UK plant passports should be issued to state compliance with the UKâ€™s new plant health regulations.</p>

<h3 id="country-of-origin">Country of origin</h3>
<p>The two-letter code â€˜GBâ€™ applies to the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Guidance will change from 1 January 2021 to hosts of Xylella fastidiosa and hosts of Ceratocystis platani. The change means that these commodities must have been in the UK for a whole year following their import before a plant passport issued for their movement can list â€˜GBâ€™ as the country of origin.</p>

<p>This applies regardless of whether plants are grown under protection or not in the UK. Therefore, you must keep records of importation date and other details to then amend the country of origin to GB 12 months after importation.</p>

<p>This policy applies to the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="hosts-of-xylella-fastidiosa">Hosts of Xylella fastidiosa</h3>
<p>The GB code applies to these hosts of Xylella fastidiosa:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plants, other than fruit or seeds of Olea europaea (olive), Coffea (coffee), Polygala myrtifolia, Prunus dulcis (almond)</li>
  <li>plants, other than seeds, intended for planting, of Lavandula sp. (lavender), Nerium oleander, Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hosts-of-ceratocystis-platani">Hosts of Ceratocystis platani</h3>
<p>The GB code applies to plants of Platanus L., intended for planting, other than seeds.</p>

<h2 id="imports-with-eu-plant-passports-from-1-january-2021">Imports with EU plant passports from 1 January 2021</h2>
<p>Imports from the EU which currently arrive into GB with an EU plant passport will instead need a phytosanitary certificate from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The process for replacing a phytosanitary certificate with a plant passport will remain the same. Attach plant passports at the first place of destination, that is the first premises the commodities reach for drop off, such as a depot or retail outlet.</p>

<p>If the commodities you trade in require a plant passport now, but you simply move them on under their existing EU plant passport, from 1 January 2021 you may need authorisation to issue a UK plant passport for them. If you imported goods to the UK under a phytosanitary certificate, you only need to issue a UK plant passport for your goods if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>youâ€™re moving them to another professional operator</li>
  <li>youâ€™re selling them to final users (those buying for personal use) by means of distance contract, for example online</li>
  <li>youâ€™re moving them to another of your own premises which is more than 10 miles from the premises where the consignment arrived</li>
  <li>the phytosanitary status of the consignment changes, for example, if it has been grown on, or if it has been reconfigured, for example, 2 plants in separate pots have been planted in a new pot together</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are already authorised to issue plant passports then you do not need a new authorisation to do this.</p>

<p>EU plant passports do not need to be invalidated when they enter GB. As the format is different to the UK plant passport they can easily be differentiated, and the EU plant passport considered invalid automatically.</p>

<h2 id="plant-passports-and-pest-free-areas">Plant Passports and Pest Free Areas</h2>
<p>Some plants and plant products must meet specific requirements to enter <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/issuing-plant-passports-to-trade-plants-in-the-eu#when-you-need-a-plant-passport" class="govuk-link">â€˜protected zonesâ€™</a> within EU countries.</p>

<p>EU Protected Zones (<abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr>) allow EU member states to place controls on imports and movements between member states. This prevents the introduction or spread of plant pests and diseases which are present elsewhere in the EU but absent from the Protected Zone.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-protected-zones-from-1-january-2021">Changes to Protected Zones from 1 January 2021</h2>
<p>The UK cannot designate all or parts of the UK as an EU Protected Zone from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The UK will replace the biosecurity protections provided by EU Protected Zones by creating 2 new designations.</p>

<h3 id="quarantine-pest-designation">Quarantine pest designation</h3>
<p>Quarantine pests are plant pests and diseases which are not established and which would be damaging if introduced, where they are absent from the whole of the UK.</p>

<p>Quarantine pests are prohibited from entering the UK and are subject to statutory control if found on plants or plants products. The requirements to prevent the entry of these pests will remain the same from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3 id="pest-free-areas-pfas-designations">Pest Free Areas (<abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr>) designations</h3>
<p>This will designate <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> in line with international standards for those pests and diseases which are absent from part of the UK, but not the whole of the UK. <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> are declared in line with recognised international standards and requirements. They can be applied to movements of plants and plant products into <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Both EU <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> allow countries to control movements of plants and plant products which may carry plant pests and diseases, where the whole country or an area within the country are free from those pests or diseases. 
Moving from <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> to quarantine pests and <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> will not change the requirements for goods moving within the UK.</p>

<p>There will be no new import or movement restrictions from the replacement of certain <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> with requirements for quarantine pests. These requirements are already in place now under the <abbr title="Protected Zone">PZ</abbr> system. The requirements for importing into and moving within <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> will be the same as they currently are for the equivalent <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are moving plants and plant products into or within UK <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> currently, you need to use an EU plant passport. You will need to use a UK plant passport if youâ€™re moving the relevant plants and plant products into or within UK <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/issuing-plant-passports-to-trade-plants-in-the-eu" class="govuk-link">Issuing plant passports to trade plants in the EU</a> to understand how to apply for a UK plant passport.</p>

<h2 id="movement-of-wood-packaging-material">Movement of wood packaging material</h2>
<p>Wood packaging material (<abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr>) moving between the UK and the rest of the EU can currently move freely without checks or controls.</p>

<p><abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pallets</li>
  <li>crates</li>
  <li>boxes</li>
  <li>cable drums</li>
  <li>spools</li>
  <li>dunnage</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 January 2021 all <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> moving between the UK and the EU must  meet <a rel="external" href="https://www.ippc.int/en/publications/regulation-wood-packaging-material-international-trade-0/" class="govuk-link">ISPM15 international standards</a> by undergoing heat treatment and marking. All <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> may be subject to official checks either upon or after entry to the EU.</p>

<p>Checks on <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> will continue to be carried out in the UK on a risk-targeted basis only. The plant health risk from <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> imported from the EU is not expected to change from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3 id="steps-to-take-now-to-prepare">Steps to take now to prepare</h3>
<p>Contact your supplier or <a rel="external" href="http://www.timcon.org/default.asp" class="govuk-link">TIMCON</a> if you need more advice about moving <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h2 id="trade-agreements">Trade agreements</h2>
<p>Any new agreements will replicate existing EU agreements as far as possible. Where replacement trade agreements are not agreed, trade will take place on <a rel="external" href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm" class="govuk-link">World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms</a> with that country. Details of each agreement will be shared with parliament and the public when they have been agreed.</p>

<h2 id="returned-plants-and-plant-products-policy-from-1-january-to-30-june-2021">Returned plants and plant products: policy from 1 January to 30 June 2021</h2>
<p>Plants and plant product consignments rejected at EU BCPs can re-enter GB through any point of entry from 1 January to 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>For rejected goods returning to England or Wales you must submit an import pre-notification using the relevant IT system to notify <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>. This guide will publish details of these IT systems before 1 January 2021. Pre-notification must be submitted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for Roll-On Roll-Off and air movements,  at least 4 working hours prior to arrival</li>
  <li>by all other modes of transport, at least one working day prior to arrival</li>
</ul>

<p>For rejected goods returning to Scotland go to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.sasa.gov.uk/eu-exit-guidance" class="govuk-link">Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture (<abbr title="Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture">SASA</abbr>) site</a>.</p>

<p>You must include a copy of the original phytosanitary certificate with pre-notification. If your consignment was exported without a phytosanitary certificate please contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> on 0300 1000 313 before returning your goods or <abbr title="Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture">SASA</abbr> on 0131 244 8890.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will assess this information to decide the conditions of import and if the consignment needs further checks on entry to Great Britain. If further checks are required someone from <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> in England and Wales or <abbr title="Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture">SASA</abbr> in Scotland will contact you.</p>
