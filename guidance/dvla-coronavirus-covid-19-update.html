<p>With 49 million drivers and 40 million vehicles on the road, millions of people transact with us each month. We issue around 12 million driving licences and 18 million vehicle log books annually and answer around 1 million phone calls each month.</p>

<p>Our online services are the quickest, easiest and often cheapest way to deal with us. We have been busy adding new online services since March 2020 to make it even easier for customers.</p>

<p>You can complete most transactions online which means you don’t need to post an application or speak to our contact centre. If you apply online, you should receive your driving licence or vehicle documents within 5 days (it can take up to 6 weeks if you post your applications to us).</p>

<p>Here are some of our most popular online services:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence" class="govuk-link">Apply for a driving licence</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Following recent lockdown announcements across the UK, DVLA will remain open.</p>

<p>Using our online services is the quickest and easiest way to complete your application. Social distancing requirements mean that we must have fewer staff than usual on site at any one time. If you post applications to us, which must be processed securely on site by a member of staff, they will take longer than if you apply online.</p>

<h2>Contacting DVLA</h2>

<h3>Driving Tests and MOTs</h3>

<p>If you have a query about driving tests or MOTs, you will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dvsa">contact DVSA</a>.  DVLA is not responsible for driving tests or MOTs.</p>

<h3>Contact Centre</h3>

<p>Our opening hours are Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm and Saturday 8am to 4pm. Demand is currently very high on our phone lines, so for all general enquiries the quickest way to find information is to use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-the-dvla">Contact DVLA</a> service to access our 24 hour chatbot or email services. You can also follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/DVLAgovuk" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Twitter</a> or use our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving" class="govuk-link">online services</a> to solve your query.</p>

<h3>Customer reception</h3>
<p>DVLA’s customer reception in Swansea is currently closed. Please do not travel for this purpose as there is no public access to the site.</p>

<h3>Paper applications</h3>

<p>Paper applications are likely to take up to 6 weeks to process, but there may be additional delays in processing more complex transactions.  There is no need to phone to chase up your application during this time as we are dealing with all paper applications as quickly as possible and in the order in which they are received.</p>

<h2>Identity documents</h2>

<p>Make sure you only send in what is required and that you check requirements on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK</a> before you post your application.</p>

<p>There is no need to send us a UK passport if you’ve provided us with a passport number on your application form.</p>

<p>If you need to post original ID documents such as passports or Biometric Residency Permits to us, we recommend that you consider using registered post.</p>

<p>Please do not send passports and other documents by post if you are planning to travel in the immediate future, and allow at least 6 to 8 weeks for processing.</p>

<h2>Renewing a driving licence</h2>

<h3>Extension for driving licences that expired between 1 February and 31 December 2020</h3>

<p>If your photocard driving licence or your entitlement to drive expired between 1 February 2020 and 31 December 2020, you have an 11-month extension from the date of expiry. This means that you will not need to renew your photocard or entitlement to drive until 11 months after your original expiry date. You do not need to do anything as this extension is automatic. If your licence or entitlement to drive in the UK has been automatically extended, then you must renew your licence before you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad">drive abroad</a>.</p>

<p>The extension only applies to full GB driving licence holders. It does not apply to provisional driving licence entitlement.</p>

<p>If you’ve already applied to renew your photocard or entitlement you can continue to drive while we are processing your application providing you have not been told by your doctor or optician that you should not drive. For further information about this, see the guidance leaflet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inf1886-can-i-drive-while-my-application-is-with-dvla">‘Can I drive while my application is with DVLA?’</a></p>

<p>By law, all drivers must make sure that they always meet the medical standards for fitness to drive when driving. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-conditions-and-driving" class="govuk-link">Find more information about driving with a medical condition.</a></p>

<p>This table shows the renewal dates based on the 11-month extension period:</p>

<h3>If your driving licence expires on or after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>You will need to renew it as normal. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence">The quickest and easiest way is to apply online</a>.</p>

<p>If you are unable to renew your licence online <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence" class="govuk-link">find more information on other ways to apply</a>. This includes advice on taking your own photograph if a new photograph is required. You will need to print your digital photograph and attach it to the application form to renew your licence.</p>

<h3>Bus and lorry drivers – D4 medical updates</h3>
<p>The government has made temporary arrangements for bus and lorry drivers aged 45 and over to forego the need for a D4 medical to renew their driving entitlement. These changes are temporary and will only apply where the licence has not expired before 1 January 2020.</p>

<p>The licence will only be valid for 1 year instead of 5 years and the driver will need to submit a completed D4 when the licence is due for renewal in 12 months. Drivers with health issues will still need to declare these, and those with health issues that prevent them from driving safely will not have their licence renewed. All drivers must ensure they are medically fit to drive.</p>

<h2>Applying to renew a driving licence if you have a medical condition</h2>

<p>If you have a health condition requiring further information or examinations, there are currently delays before NHS doctors, consultants or opticians are able to provide us with the information we need to be able to make a licensing decision.</p>

<p>Providing you have a current driving licence and you have not been told by your doctor or optician that you should not drive, you will be able to drive while DVLA is considering your application and waiting for a response from NHS professionals.</p>

<p>Road safety is our top priority and by law, all drivers must meet certain minimum medical standards and must make sure they are medically fit to drive. All drivers must tell DVLA about the onset or worsening of a medical condition. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-conditions-and-driving" class="govuk-link">Check if a health condition affects your driving</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-medical-driving-licence" class="govuk-link">renew your driving licence in other ways</a> if you cannot renew online.</p>
