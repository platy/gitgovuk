<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Greece to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit. 
Greece’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migration.gov.gr/en/" rel="external">check with Greece’s government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Greece. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Greece’s authorities or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<p>Any documents submitted to the immigration authorities in Greece will need to be translated into Greek. You can submit documents in English to the Greek consulate in the UK.</p>

<p>You also need to check if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa. This guide uses the same terms used in Greece, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Greece’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Greece for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attending a job interview</li>
  <li>attending a trade fair</li>
  <li>attending a board meeting</li>
  <li>attending a meeting with client or customer</li>
  <li>attending meetings with colleagues</li>
  <li>attending a meeting with a contractor or vendor</li>
  <li>negotiating deals or contracts</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference (unpaid)</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Document requirements</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your entire stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Greece’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt. 
All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<h3>EU intra-company transfers from other countries</h3>

<p>If you have an EU intra-company transfer permit (EU ICT) from another country you can work for up to 90 days in a 180-day period in Greece. You do not have to apply for a visa or permit.</p>

<p>The company you’re moving from must notify the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migration.gov.gr/en/" rel="external">Greek Ministry of Migration and Asylum</a>.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>employment confirmation</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as degree and professional certificates</li>
  <li>CV</li>
  <li>your EU ICT permit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migration.gov.gr/en/migration-policy/metanasteusi-stin-ellada/katigories-adeion-diamonis-politon-triton-choron-dikaiologitika%e2%80%8b/" rel="external">Greece’s immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migration.gov.gr/en/migration-policy/metanasteusi-stin-ellada/katigories-adeion-diamonis-politon-triton-choron-dikaiologitika%e2%80%8b/" rel="external">Greece’s immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>If you have a family they won’t be able to join you if you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#visa">national visa for temporary employment</a>. They may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">join you under the Schengen visa waiver rules</a>.</p>

<p>They may be able to join you if you have a national digital nomad visa. They can request an individual visa ending at the same time as the dependent visa.</p>

<p>They can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migration.gov.gr/migration-policy/metanasteusi-stin-ellada/katigories-adeion-diamonis-politon-triton-choron-dikaiologitika%E2%80%8B/" rel="external">join you with all of the long-term residence permits</a> in this guide. Some permits have conditions so you should check. If they’re joining you they will need to apply for a long-stay family member residence permit.</p>

<h3>Visas and residence permits</h3>

<p>You need a <a class="govuk-link" href="#visa">national visa for temporary residence</a> if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a fisherman  working for up to 11 months</li>

</ul>

<p>You need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://migration.gov.gr/en/migration-policy/metanasteusi-stin-ellada/katigories-adeion-diamonis-politon-triton-choron-dikaiologitika%e2%80%8b/" rel="external">long-term residence permit (for work and professional reasons)</a> if you don’t qualify for a temporary residence visa and you’re:</p>

</ul>

<p>Long-stay permits are valid for up to 2 years depending on which one you need. They can be renewed for 3 years at a time.</p>

<h2>National visa for temporary residence</h2>

<p>A national visa takes 3 to 5 working days to get. It’s valid for either up to 6 months, or up to 1 year. You can’t extend it.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You need to request approval from the relevant authority responsible for your profession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mfa.gr/missionsabroad/images/visas/national/application_for_a_visa_for_a_long_stay_in_greece.pdf" rel="external">apply for a national visa</a> at the Greek embassy or consulate.</p>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>Greece’s authorities may request <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mfa.gr/missionsabroad/images/visas/national/TranslationOfTheGeneralSupportingDocumentsForNationalVisas.docx" rel="external">different documents</a> at different stages of the process. They will vary depending on your circumstances. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>

  <li>travel health insurance for your entire stay which must cover the costs if you’re sent home for medical reasons, and any urgent medical care or emergency hospital care</li>
