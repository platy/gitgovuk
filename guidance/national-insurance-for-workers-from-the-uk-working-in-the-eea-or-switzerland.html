<p>If you normally work in the UK or the EU and your work location has changed temporarily because of coronavirus (COVID-19) travel restrictions, HMRC can consider your individual circumstances to decide if you should pay National Insurance contributions in the UK.</p>

<p>If you need proof that you have to pay UK National Insurance contributions, you should apply for a <a href="#certificate" class="govuk-link">certificate</a> and include details of the COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re an employee or self-employed, where you pay social security contributions will depend on your circumstances and the country you are going to work in. If you’re an employer, your liability to pay social security contributions will follow the liability of your employees.</p>

<p>If you go to work in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EU, you’ll only have to pay into one country’s social security scheme at a time</li>
  <li>Iceland, Norway or Switzerland, you may only have to pay into one country’s social security scheme at a time</li>
</ul>

<p>This will usually be in the country where the work is being done.</p>

<p>In the UK, social security contributions are called National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h2>Working in the EU and when you’ll continue to pay UK National Insurance contributions</h2>

<p>The UK has social security agreements with the EU.</p>

<p>You’ll continue to pay National Insurance contributions only in the UK if HMRC has issued you with the relevant certificate as evidence that this is the case.</p>

<p>You, or your employer, should apply for a certificate if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>going to work temporarily in the EU for up to 2 years</li>
  <li>worker working in the UK and one or more EU countries</li>
  <li>a civil servant working for the UK government</li>
  <li>working onboard a vessel at sea, with a UK flag</li>
  <li>working as a flight or cabin crew member, where your home base is in the UK</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The relevant certificate is not a work permit. You’ll need to check the immigration rules of the country you’re working in if you’re not lawfully resident there.</p>
</div>

<h2>Working in Switzerland and when you’ll continue to pay UK National Insurance Contributions</h2>

<p>The UK has social security agreements with Switzerland.</p>

<p>You’ll continue to pay National Insurance contributions only in the UK if HMRC has issued you with the relevant certificate as evidence that this is the case.</p>

<p>You, or your employer, should apply for a certificate if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>going to work temporarily in Switzerland for up to 2 years</li>
  <li>a worker working in the UK and Switzerland</li>
  <li>a civil servant working in Switzerland for the UK government</li>
  <li>working on board a vessel at sea with a UK flag</li>
  <li>working as a flight or cabin crew member where your home base is in the UK</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working in Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway</h2>

<h3>If you’re covered by the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> Separation Agreement</h3>

<p>You’ll be covered by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eea-efta-separation-agreement-and-explainer" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> Separation Agreement</a> if you’re a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>national of the UK who was resident or started working in Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway before 1 January 2021 and have been working there since</li>
  <li>national of Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway, who was resident or started working in the UK before 1 January 2021, including if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme status</a>
</li>
  <li>family member of a national of, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway who has EU Settlement Scheme status, and you’re residing in the UK</li>
  <li>person with dual nationality, one of which is the UK and either Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway</li>
  <li>national of the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway working in UK and one or more countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway before 1 January 2021 and continue
to do so and you work mainly in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re covered by this agreement, you’ll continue paying National Insurance contributions only in the UK if HMRC has issued you with the relevant certificate as evidence that this is the case. You, or your employer, should apply for a certificate if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>going to work temporarily in Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway for up to 2 years</li>
  <li>working in the UK and one or more countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway</li>
  <li>a civil servant working for the UK government</li>
  <li>working onboard a vessel at sea, with a UK flag</li>
  <li>working as a flight or cabin crew member, where the home base is in the UK</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The relevant certificate is not a work permit. You’ll need to check the immigration rules of the country you’re working in if you’re not lawfully resident there.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you’re not covered by the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> Separation Agreement</h3>

<p>The UK has social security agreements with Iceland and Norway which are sometimes called reciprocal agreements.</p>

<p>If you’re not covered by covered by the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> Separation Agreement or the Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement, you may be covered by a social security agreement. If so, you may still be able to apply to HMRC for a certificate to show evidence that you are liable to pay social security contributions only in the UK if you’re going to work temporarily in the following countries:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#norway">Norway</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ice" class="govuk-link">Iceland</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Going to work in Norway from the UK</h4>

<p>You should apply to HMRC for a certificate as evidence that you’re liable to pay social security contributions only in the UK, if you’re working temporarily in Norway for up to 3 years. You should apply for a certificate before you go to work temporarily in Norway but must apply within the first 4 months of going to work there. This means you’ll not have to pay social security contributions in Norway for that duration of work.</p>

<h4>Going to work in Iceland from the UK</h4>

<p>You should apply to HMRC for a certificate as evidence that you’re liable to social security contributions only in the UK if you’re employed and a non-UK and non-<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> national working temporarily in Iceland for up to 1 year. This can be extended by a further year, but you must get agreement from HMRC before the end of the first year. This means you’ll not have to pay social security contributions in Iceland for that duration of work.</p>

<h2>When you’ll pay social security contributions in the country you’re going to work in</h2>

<p>If you’re <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad#working-in-any-other-country">going to work abroad</a> and you’re not covered by a social security agreement and so not eligible for a certificate from HMRC, as evidence that you are liable to pay social security contributions only in the UK, you’ll need to continue paying UK National Insurance contributions for the first 52 weeks, if you meet the following 4 conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re going to work abroad temporarily</li>
  <li>your employer has a place of business in the UK</li>
  <li>you were living in the UK immediately before starting work abroad</li>
  <li>you’re ordinarily resident in the UK</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>HMRC consider you’re ordinarily resident in a country if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>normally live there, apart from temporary or occasional absences</li>
  <li>have a settled and regular mode of life there</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about when you must pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions and ordinarily resident read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-security-abroad-ni38">leaflet NI38</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If the conditions above apply, you may also have to pay contributions in the country you’re working in.</p>

<p>If the conditions above do not apply, you may need to pay contributions in the country you are working in. You’ll not be liable to pay contributions in the UK during this period, but you may be able to pay <a href="https://www.gov.uk/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions" class="govuk-link">voluntary contributions</a>.</p>

<p>If HMRC advises that you must pay UK National Insurance contributions, we’ll issue a certificate as evidence that you’re liable to pay social security contributions in the UK so that you do not have to pay them in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland.</p>

<h3>If your situation changes</h3>

<p>You need to check if a change in your situation stops the existing social security rules from applying to you, send a letter to HMRC, telling them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what your circumstances were</li>
  <li>what has changed, for example, if your work, employment or self-employment ends earlier than expected, or you change employer</li>
  <li>when the changes happen</li>
</ul>

<p>You should send your letter to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

PT Operations North East England
<br>HM Revenue and Customs
<br>BX9 1AN
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You do not need to include a street name or PO box in the address.</p>

<p>HMRC will let you know if they need any more information.</p>
