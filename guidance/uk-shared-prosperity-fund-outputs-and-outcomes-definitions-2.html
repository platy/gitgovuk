<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>2.1 An updated list of outputs and outcomes can be found <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1091803/UKSPF_Indicators_13.07.22.xlsx">here</a> (<span class="type">MS Excel Spreadsheet</span>, <span class="file-size">54.9 KB</span>)</span> providing the indicator definition and unit of measurement that corresponds to each output and outcome title. These definitions will continue to be refined and improved as the programme continues. Any amendments to the definitions will be managed, with the input of lead local authorities, to minimise their impact on delivery.</p>

<p>2.2 DLUHC encourage lead local authorities to take a pragmatic and proportionate approach to determining the appropriate outputs and outcomes aligned to the interventions in their investment plan. Decisions on selecting outputs and outcomes are for lead local authorities to determine based on their experience of delivering similar projects and programmes, including through the Community Renewal Fund. Similarly, baseline data, along with the data collection and evidence to substantiate delivery, should also be proportionate to the interventions being supported and should be determined locally by the lead local authority working with partner organisations.</p>

<p>2.3 The outputs and outcomes provided by lead local authorities as part of the Investment Plan are indicative and DLUHC expect plans provided by lead local authorities to be refined as delivery progresses. This is reflected by the flexibility given to the process of refining outputs as part of the change control process for the Fund,  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-shared-prosperity-fund-reporting-and-performance-management-3">see Reporting and Performance Management page</a>. DLUHC recognises that outcomes are more challenging to define and therefore lead local authorities can continue to develop and amend these throughout delivery.</p>

<p>2.4 The outputs and outcomes definitions document also contains details of the specific changes that the lead local authorities need to make in recording their outputs and outcomes. Lead local authorities do not need to make any of these adjustments until the first round of sixth-monthly reporting in May 2023. For the purpose of the investment plan, lead local authorities should continue to complete the indicative deliverables return as set out in the spreadsheet. The below changes will be made for the first round of reporting in early 2023:</p>

<p>Outputs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amount of new or improved cycleways or paths (m2) – the unit of measurement will be changed from m2 to km.</li>
  <li>Levels of participation in sports and recreational activities at facilities that have benefitted from funding (based on registered players/teams) (% increase) – this output will be discontinued. If a lead local authority submits a figure for this output as part of the investment plan process, DLUHC will ask the lead local authority to choose an alternative output for the first round of reporting. This will not impact lead local authorities’ thresholds for change process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of new to market products (numerical value) – the focus will be changed from the products to the businesses that introduced them.</li>
  <li>Enterprises introducing new products to the firm as a result of support - this outcome will be discontinued. If a lead local authority submits a figure for this outcome as part of the investment plan process, DLUHC will ask the lead local authority to choose an alternative outcome for the first round of reporting. Outcomes are not considered as part of change process.</li>
  <li>Number of new or improved community facilities as a result of support&nbsp;-&nbsp;this outcome will be discontinued. If a lead local authority submits a figure for this outcome as part of the investment plan process, DLUHC will ask the lead local authority to choose an alternative outcome for the first round of reporting. Outcomes are not considered as part of change control.</li>
  <li>Number of angel investors in the local area&nbsp;-&nbsp;this outcome will be discontinued. If a lead local authority submits a figure for this outcome as part of the investment plan process, DLUHC will ask the lead local authority to choose an alternative outcome for the first round of reporting. Outcomes are not considered as part of change control.</li>
  <li>Some outcomes that currently request a % (either increase or decrease) – the request will change from % to actuals from the first round of reporting.</li>
</ul>

<p>2.5 The change in those outcomes which will move to an actual from a % will support DLUHC to better aggregate the outcomes and will streamline the requests for lead local authorities.</p>

<p>2.6 It is the responsibility of the lead local authority to collect and report outputs and outcomes to DLUHC through the reporting process <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-shared-prosperity-fund-reporting-and-performance-management-3">detailed in Reporting and Performance Management</a>.</p>

<p>2.7 The lead local authority should also collect baseline data (i.e. a recording of the output or outcome before the intervention has taken place). DLUHC will not provide baseline data, lead local authorities will be expected to source and identify such data themselves. For many outputs it will not be possible to provide a baseline recording, as by their definition it will be zero (e.g. amount of cycle paths completed). However, for outcomes it is important to record a baseline where possible, as these metrics are aiming to measure change caused through the programme.</p>

<p>2.8 Lead local authorities should seek to collect and store evidence that can substantiate outputs and outcomes that are reported appropriately. Suitable evidence will vary between outputs and outcomes and may in part depend on the project being delivered. Lead local authorities should seek to collect a range of evidence to substantiate the baseline and post-intervention data. Examples of evidence that may be suitable include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photos for projects which create a visible change (e.g., any construction or regeneration projects).</li>
  <li>Formal documentation involved in the process (e.g., Energy Performance Certificates, memorandum of understandings created, floorplans, enrolment registers etc.)</li>
  <li>Evidence provided by contractors (e.g., emails certifying completion).</li>
</ul>

<p>2.9 A reported output must be a direct&nbsp;cause&nbsp;of an intervention. For example, if a skills-related intervention was delivered, it is the number of recipients of that specific intervention that should be captured. DLUHC recognise that it may be more difficult to attribute and separate out the impact of the UKSPF on outcomes, which may be impacted through other channels other than UKSPF projects. For example, vacancy rates in an area may be impacted by general economic conditions. Therefore, the lead local authority should report as accurately as possible on the outcome(s) that the project is trying to achieve. Where it is possible to distinguish between outcomes that have been impacted through other channels in addition to the UKSPF, lead local authorities should avoid reporting those changes that are not the result of the UKSPF. Further details on evaluation and the approach to causal impacts are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-shared-prosperity-fund-monitoring-and-evaluation-4">Monitoring and Evaluation</a>.</p>

<p>2.10 Where an intervention’s causal outputs and outcomes&nbsp;feed directly into&nbsp;more than one UKSPF priority, the outputs and outcomes should be captured under the appropriate indicators. This means that if an intervention falls into more than one priority, lead local authorities should capture all outputs and outcomes across all/any relevant priority. For example, if an economically inactive person has attended a People &amp; Skills intervention course that has a built-in employment support component, this attendance can be captured under both ‘Number of people attending training sessions’ and ‘Number of people receiving support to gain employment’ output indicators.</p>

<p>2.11 If a lead local authority captures additional outputs and outcomes that relate to a different priority than those directly related to the intervention undertaken, DLUHC encourage places to keep a record of this information as it may be useful for evaluation and reporting purposes. Lead local authorities are also encouraged to record any additional outputs or outcomes that they deem relevant but have not been specified as indicators under any of the defined priorities.</p>

<p>2.12 Lead local authorities do not need to choose or report on all indicators for the intervention chosen, only those which the lead local authority identify as relevant to the activity undertaken.</p>

<p>2.13 On occasions where two or more projects combined result in one output or outcome, the lead local authority should use its judgement based on attribution to decide where the relevant indicator’s reporting should sit. It is not considered double counting if the unit of measurement is different. The aim of this is to measure different elements of an output or outcome. For example, a new cycle way can, and should, be recorded under both the output indicators ‘total length of new or improved cycle ways’ and ‘number of new or improved cycle ways’.</p>

<p>2.14 A beneficiary of a project, e.g., an individual or business, may create more than one output or outcome to be counted against different indicators. For example, a single business may receive a financial grant as well as another type of support. In these situations, they should be recorded in all relevant outputs or outcomes and will not be considered double counting.</p>
