<h2>Book and plan your visit to Sudbury</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>January 2022 update</h3>

<p>Visitors aged 12 and over need to take a lateral flow device test (LFD) before coming for their visit. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic#testing">Find out more here</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of other ways to <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">contact someone in prison if you are unable to visit them</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>

<p>There may be a limit to the number of visits a person can have, depending on ‘privileges’. Prisoners with enhanced privileges can have 4 visits a month, standard can have 3 and basic can have 2 visits a month.</p>

<h3>Entering Sudbury Prison</h3>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  Read the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">acceptable forms of <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Sudbury has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should wear family-friendly clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons). You will be turned away if you are not dressed appropriately.</p>

<p>Each visitor group is allowed to take in a maximum of £25.</p>

<p>The only items you can take in are those for small children, such as nappies, wipes, a change of clothes, feeding bottles and sealed baby food.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There is a family-friendly visitors centre run by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonadvice.org.uk/hmp-sudbury" rel="external">Prison Advice and Care Trust (PACT)</a>.</p>

<p>Visitors are offered a warm welcome, information and support. There are books and colouring in for children.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are no toilet facilities except in the visits hall.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<p>There are currently no family days being run.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Sudbury</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Sudbury.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Sudbury using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at Sudbury.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number or date of birth on the envelope. Also add your name and address on the back of the envelope.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Prisoners in Sudbury must first apply to have any items brought in. Then the visitor brings the items to the prison when they visit. They are signed for and secured. Once opened, checked and processed at reception, the prisoner can pick them up.</p>

<p>Items such as bedding, clothes and footwear are allowed as parcels if men are not receiving visits.</p>

<p>Family and friends of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<h2>Life at Sudbury</h2>
<p>Sudbury is a rehabilitation and resettlement prison. Sudbury is committed to providing a safe and educational environment where men can learn new skills to help them on release.</p>

<p>Prisoners are required to work, attend education classes or training courses.</p>

<p>Sudbury aims to provide prisoners with healthcare equivalent to that in the community, sport and leisure facilities and opportunities to practice their religion.</p>

<h3>Security and safeguarding</h3>
<p>Every person at Sudbury has a right to feel safe. The staff are responsible for their safeguarding and welfare at all times.</p>

<p>For further information about what to do when you are worried or concerned about someone in prison <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/pages/category/need-urgent-help?Take=24" rel="external">visit the Prisoners’ Families helpline website</a>.</p>

<p>All safeguarding processes are overseen by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://derbyshiresab.org.uk/home.aspx" rel="external">Derbyshire Safeguarding Adults Board</a>.</p>

<p>Support networks are available to prisoners including a listeners scheme, Samaritans and peer supporters.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>
<p>When a prisoner first arrives at Sudbury, they will be able to contact a family member by phone. This could be quite late in the evening, depending on the time they arrive.</p>

<p>They will get to speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>
<p>Each person who arrives at Sudbury gets an induction that lasts about a week. They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone also finds out about the rules, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<p>They will meet their supervisor from the Offender Management Unit (OMU) within 10 days of their arrival who will deal with any individual issues.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Almost 600 men live at Sudbury in double rooms in 14 dormitories. There are communal washing facilities available.</p>

<p>There are 6 other dorms which are single occupancy and prisoners go on a waiting list for these.</p>

<p>We also have rooms accessible for people with disabilities.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>
<p>All prisoners in Sudbury Prison are expected to work, unless they’re unable to due to age or disability. Sudbury has a number of partners who provide work opportunities both inside and outside the prison.</p>

<p>Opportunities inside Sudbury include working in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>kitchens</li>
  <li>gardens</li>
  <li>farm shop</li>
  <li>waste management</li>
  <li>workshops</li>
  <li>painting and decorating</li>
  <li>carpentry</li>
  <li>bricklaying</li>
  <li>plastering</li>
</ul>

<p>Outside Sudbury, there are opportunities for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>community and charity placements</li>
  <li>work experience</li>
  <li>educational courses</li>
  <li>paid employment</li>
</ul>

<p>Prisoners can get help with drug and alcohol issues and attend offending behaviour courses. Men in Sudbury must sign up to a drug testing programme.</p>

<p>They can also train to be peer support workers in most areas of the prison.</p>

<p>Men in Sudbury get help with opening a bank account and advice on managing debt and finding accommodation.</p>

<p>Job Centre Plus attends the prison to help with issues related to work or benefits. There is also a National Career Service worker to help prisoners identify and achieve employment goals.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>
<p>Sudburys prisoners can apply for release on temporary licence (ROTL).</p>

<p>This can be used to gain work experience in the local community, maintain family ties and prepare for release.</p>

<p>The prison follows the most up to date policies for assessing whether a prisoner is suitable. This will be explained to the prisoner when he meets with his offender supervisor.</p>
