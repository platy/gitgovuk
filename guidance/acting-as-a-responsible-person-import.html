<p>A wholesale dealer in Great Britain may only import Qualified Person (<abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr>) certified medicines from countries on and Approved Country for Import list (initially, this will be countries in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) if certain checks are made by the ‘Responsible Person (import) (<abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>)’. Great Britain is England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>This guidance describes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how you can apply to be an <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>
</li>
  <li>how to verify that <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification of a medicine has been completed</li>
  <li>how to verify that biological products (vaccines and medicines derived from human blood or plasma) have an independent batch release certificate</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> applications may be submitted through the MHRA Portal</p>

<h2>1. Products which do not require <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> oversight</h2>

<p>Medicinal products sourced from Northern Ireland for wholesale purposes are out of scope of this guidance. This is permitted under the supervision of a Responsible Person (RP).</p>

<p>Products with a UK or Great Britain marketing authorisation that are imported into Great Britain from outside the UK without <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification from a country on the list will require <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification under a UK manufacturing and import authorisation before being placed on the market.</p>

<p>Products without a marketing authorisation in the UK, Northern Ireland, Great Britain or a listed country are outside the scope of this guidance. Importation of such products is permitted under the supervision of a Responsible Person (RP), with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notification-of-intent-to-import-an-unlicensed-medicinal-product">notification</a> to the MHRA of each importation that is for supply to the Great Britain market.</p>

<h2>2. Introduction</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> is responsible for implementing a system to confirm for products that have been imported into Great Britain from countries on an approved country for import list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the required <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification has taken place</li>
  <li>that the required independent batch release certificate is available for biological products (described on a wholesale dealer’s license as ‘immunologicals and blood products’)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> may delegate the activity of checking this certification has taken place but remains responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of these checks.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> is required to implement a system for confirming <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification and independent batch release certification (for biological products) has taken place when importing into Great Britain the following products from a listed country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A UK or Great Britain licensed medicine for use in Great Britain</li>
  <li>A UK or Great Britain licensed medicine for export</li>
  <li>A Northern Ireland or approved country licensed medicine for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supply-unlicensed-medicinal-products-specials">supply to fulfil special clinical needs</a>
</li>
  <li>A Northern Ireland or approved country licensed medicine imported for export</li>
  <li>A Northern Ireland or approved country licensed medicine for use as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medicines-apply-for-a-parallel-import-licence" class="govuk-link">parallel import</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. What evidence can be used for <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> should ensure that written evidence is available to demonstrate that each batch of product has been <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certified as required in Article 51 of <a rel="external" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/directive-2001/83/ec-european-parliament-council-6-november-2001-community-code-relating-medicinal-products-human-use_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Directive 2001/83/EC</a>.</p>

<p>Not all options listed below may be suitable for different supply chain relationships, however just one of these pieces of evidence is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of regulation 45AA of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. Other evidence may be acceptable provided it confirms that <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification has taken place for the batch in question.</p>

<h3>3.1 Evidence for Great Britain Wholesale Dealers Licence (WDA(H)) holders importing a UK, Northern Ireland, Great Britain or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> licensed medicine from a listed country</h3>

<p>Batch certification by a <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> may be confirmed using evidence such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Batch certificate confirming <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification in accordance with Article 51 of Directive 2001/83/EC)</li>
  <li>A copy of the ‘control report’ (Appendix II to EU Good Manufacturing Practice <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-4/v4_an16_201510_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Annex 16</a>)</li>
  <li>Statement of certification (ad-hoc, confirming certification in accordance with Article 51 of Directive 2001/83/EC)</li>
  <li>Reference to company internal systems (e.g. global Enterprise Resource Planning system) that shows batch certification</li>
  <li>Confirmation that the final manufacturing step (other than batch certification) of an authorised medicine has been performed by a Manufacturing and Import Authorisation holder in a listed country. A copy of the Marketing Authorisation and technical agreement with the manufacturer should be available to place reliance on this supply chain control</li>
  <li>For medicines authorised in a listed country, batch certification may be verified by confirming that the medicine has been purchased from an authorised wholesaler after it has been ‘placed on the market’ in the listed country</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. What evidence can be used for independent batch release certification</h2>

<p>Biological products requiring independent batch release certification are listed on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.edqm.eu/en/human-ocabr-guidelines">European Directorate for Quality of Medicines website</a>.</p>

<p>Independent batch release may be confirmed using evidence such as:
* a statement from the marketing authorisation holder confirming that a batch certificate has been <a href="https://nibsc.org/about_us/latest_news/guidance_for_mfrs.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">issued by <abbr title="National Institute for Biological Standards and Control">NIBSC</abbr> or a Mutual Recognition Agreement partner</a>
* a copy of the batch certificate issued by <a href="https://nibsc.org/about_us/latest_news/guidance_for_mfrs.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="National Institute for Biological Standards and Control">NIBSC</abbr> or a Mutual Recognition Agreement partner</a>
* confirmation from <abbr title="National Institute for Biological Standards and Control">NIBSC</abbr> that a batch certificate has been issued. Enquiries should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CPB@nibsc.org">CPB@nibsc.org</a>.</p>

<p>Batches of <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certified biological medicines that require independent batch release should not be sold or supplied by the importing wholesale dealer in Great Britain until independent batch release certification is also confirmed.</p>

<h2>5. Additional guidance</h2>

<h3>5.1 Supply chain security</h3>

<p>Checks on products imported from a listed country should also ensure that the product is not the subject of a recall or reported as stolen and is available on the market within the listed country’s licensed supply chain. <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2013.343.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:C:2013:343:TOC" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Good Distribution Practice</a> (<abbr title="Good Distribution Practice">GDP</abbr>) requirements for supplier qualification set out in <abbr title="Good Distribution Practice">GDP</abbr> 5.2 must be maintained. The MHRA’s <a href="https://mhrainspectorate.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/17/qualification-of-suppliers-a-helpful-reminder-of-the-3-steps-needed-to-assure-supply-chain-integrity/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">supplier verification blog</a> provides additional information. Products that have been certified by a <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> but have been diverted to countries not within a listed country or Northern Ireland must be imported by the holder of an MIA and recertified by a <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>5.2 Great Britain WDA(H) holders acting as or on behalf of the UK Marketing Authorisation Holder (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>)</h3>
<p>For Great Britain WDA(H) holders acting as or on behalf of the UK or Great Britain <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>, the expectation is that products have been certified prior to importation. Shipment to Great Britain under pre-certification quarantine is not acceptable for the WDA(H) importation model.</p>

<p>If supply chains require shipment under quarantine prior to <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification for technical reasons (e.g. products with very short shelf life) the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> should seek further advice from MHRA by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:GDP.Inspectorate@mhra.gov.uk"><abbr title="Good Distribution Practice">GDP</abbr>.Inspectorate@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>6. Working as an <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you are named as an <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> on a WDA(H) you have an important role in ensuring the safe control of medicines. You have training and an understanding of the industry in order to qualify for the role, where you have the legal responsibility to ensure that batches of authorised medicines imported from countries on a list have been appropriately certified prior to being placed on the Great Britain market.</p>

<p>You will take responsibility for implementing a system for the WDA(H) as a whole. There is no requirement for each site on the WDA(H) to name its own <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>. You do not have to be an employee of the licence holder but must be continuously contactable. Where you are not an employee, there should be a written contract between the licence holder and the <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> specifying responsibilities, duties, authority and time on site.</p>

<p>If you are a contract <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> then you are expected to ensure you do not over-extend yourself and apply to act as <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> for too many companies.</p>

<h2>7. Becoming an <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are two stages to becoming named as an <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>.</p>

<h3>7.1 Eligibility</h3>

<p>You must first demonstrate that you are eligible to act as an <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>. This is through a combination of relevant qualifications and experience. You must be a member of a professional body with a published code of conduct. Once eligibility has been assessed and accepted by MHRA, you can be named on a register; the register will be maintained by MHRA and will include all persons eligible to be named as an <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>.</p>

<p>The regulations set out expectations for qualifications, experience and membership of professional bodies.</p>

<h4>Qualifications</h4>

<p>Acceptable qualifications are a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded on completion of a university or other higher education course of study in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pharmacy</li>
  <li>chemistry</li>
  <li>medicine</li>
  <li>biology or</li>
  <li>a related life science</li>
</ul>

<p>Equivalent qualifications acceptable for <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> candidates include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 5 qualifications from <a href="https://ciltuk.org.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport</a>
</li>
  <li>A Quality Management System Lead Auditor or Pharmaceutical GMP Lead Auditor qualification awarded by <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.quality.org/">Chartered Quality Institute</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Other qualifications may also be acceptable. These will be checked during the application process. You can check the suitability of your qualifications by email to <a href="mailto:GDP.Inspectorate@mhra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Good Distribution Practice">GDP</abbr>.Inspectorate@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>7.1.1. Experience</h4>

<p>You must be able to demonstrate, for example by providing a curriculum vitae (CV), that you have a minimum of 2 years’ experience in performing the functions of a responsible person on a WDA(H). Evidence of performing other functions, for example a quality assurance role for a pharmaceutical manufacturer, may also be considered equivalent.</p>

<h4>7.1.2. Professional bodies</h4>

<p>Acceptable professional body memberships are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Royal Society of Biology</li>
  <li>Royal Pharmaceutical Society</li>
  <li>Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Royal Society of Chemistry</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional bodies that the licensing authority considers to be equivalent for <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> candidates include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport</li>
  <li>The Chartered Quality Institute</li>
  <li>The Organisation for Professionals in Regulatory Affairs</li>
  <li>Association of Pharmacy Technicians UK (APTUK)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other professional associations may be acceptable. These will be checked during the application process. You can check the suitability of your professional body membership by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:GDP.Inspectorate@mhra.gov.uk"><abbr title="Good Distribution Practice">GDP</abbr>.Inspectorate@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to be a ‘full member’ rather than affiliate or student member of a professional body corresponding to your qualifications and experience. Affiliate membership of a professional body where you do not have a related qualification is not acceptable. You will need to demonstrate continual professional development and will comply with the professional code of conduct expected by the professional body.</p>

<h4>7.1.3. Qualified Persons acting as <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>
</h4>

<p>If you are a person named on the Qualified Persons register you will also be eligible to act as an <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>. You must still apply to be named on the <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> register. As an alternative to providing evidence of your qualifications and membership of a professional body you may provide evidence of your <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> registration.</p>

<h3>7.2 Suitability</h3>

<p>You must also demonstrate suitability to be named on a specific WDA(H) licence. At the time of application, MHRA will confirm whether you are named on the register, and check whether your experience is suitable for the proposed licence activity. For example, an eligible <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> without prior experience in parallel importation might not be considered suitable to be named on WDA(H) where the company are importing licensed products for parallel trade.</p>

<h3>7.3 Applying to be named as an <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> applications may be submitted through the <a href="https://pclportal.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">MHRA Portal</a> from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The Responsible Person (import) (<abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr>) is described in regulations 45AA and 45AB of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179185/regulation/37" rel="external" class="govuk-link">as amended</a>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Responsible Person (import)">RPi</abbr> should be a UK resident. You will need to provide proof of address and identity when you apply.</p>
