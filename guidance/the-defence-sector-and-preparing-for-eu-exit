<h3 id="recognising-caa-and-easa-licences">Recognising <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> and <abbr title="European Aviation Safety Agency">EASA</abbr> licences</h3>

<p>Certificates which were issued by the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr>, or for a UK based organisation by <abbr title="European Aviation Safety Agency">EASA</abbr>, before the UK leaves the EU would no longer be automatically accepted after Brexit.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://info.caa.co.uk/euexit/">Read about how businesses can apply for valid safety certification for the <abbr title="European Aviation Safety Agency">EASA</abbr> system</a> before the UK leaves the EU through third country approval or transferring your licence to another <abbr title="European Aviation Safety Agency">EASA</abbr> state.</p>

<p>The European Commission <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32019R0494&from=EN">Regulation 2019/494</a> states that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type certificates (and a number of related certificates) and design organisation approvals issued by <abbr title="European Aviation Safety Agency">EASA</abbr> to UK organisations before the UK leaves the EU will remain valid for 9 months</li>
  <li>Authorised Release Certificates, Certificates of Release to Service and Airworthiness Review Certificates issued before the UK leaves the EU by organisations approved by the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> will be valid with no time limit</li>
</ul>

<p>Businesses with UK-issued certificates for aircraft registered in the EU should check the European Commission’s notice and with the relevant EU authorities.</p>

<p>The Military Aviation Authority (MAA) has also issued guidance on the implications of leaving the European Union without a deal on compliance with the MAA’s Regulatory Publications <a rel="external" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.publishing.service.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F831388%2FMAA_RN_2019_11.pdf&data=02%7C01%7CDDC-MODInternet%40mod.gov.uk%7C0979933d5b554165243908d737995536%7Cbe7760ed5953484bae95d0a16dfa09e5%7C0%7C0%7C637039004003447266&sdata=2c0TTFPLN%2FRWMYpKRH8eEMdyd270dntrNbLZYeIl%2FsU%3D&reserved=0">MAA Regulatory Notice MAA/RN/2019/11</a>.</p>

<h3 id="importing-or-using-chemicals">Importing or using chemicals</h3>

<p>If you use or import chemicals then you will need to check whether you have new obligations under UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation">REACH</abbr> (the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation).</p>

<p>For example, if you currently purchase a chemical substance directly from an EU/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> supplier, you must make sure any substances you purchase are covered by a valid UK <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation">REACH</abbr> registration by someone within your supply chain. Otherwise, in order to remain compliant you will need to register as an ‘importer’. To do so, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open an account on <abbr title="Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation">REACH</abbr> IT once it is established and provide initial information on your registration within 180 days of the UK leaving the EU</li>
  <li>provide full technical information on your registration within 2 years of the UK leaving the EU.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-chemicals-reach-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/regulating-chemicals-reach-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">guidance on regulating chemicals if the UK leaves the EU without a deal</a> and the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/brexit/reach-guidance.htm">chemical regulation guidance from <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr></a>.</p>

<h4 id="ensure-you-can-continue-to-manufacture-and-export-chemical-products">Ensure you can continue to manufacture and export chemical products</h4>

<p>There may also be new actions you need to take if you manufacture or export chemicals. Further information is provided on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/brexit/brexit-no-deal-guidance.htm"><abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="recognising-harmonised-goods">Recognising harmonised goods</h3>

<p>After the UK leaves the EU the results of conformity assessment carried out by UK conformity assessment bodies will no longer be recognised in the EU.</p>

<p>This means you must get your products assessed and marked by an EU recognised conformity assessment body if you want to sell them in the EU. You can also arrange for assessments to be transferred to an EU-recognised body before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You will still be able to use CE marking based on self-declaration of conformity, whether you are selling in the UK or exporting to the EU.</p>

<p>The UK government has also introduced a new UKCA mark, which some businesses will need to use when they place products on the UK market after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-eu-internal-market-if-theres-no-deal">placing manufactured goods on the EU internal market if there’s no deal</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-uk-market-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">placing manufactured goods on the UK internal market if there’s no deal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="providing-services-to-eea-and-efta-countries">Providing services to <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>The UK will no longer operate under the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) regulations for the cross-border trade in services, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<p>This means that the rights and protections provided by the EU Directives and EU Treaty rights of Freedom of Movement and Freedom of Establishment will no longer apply to the UK.</p>

<p>UK businesses will no longer be treated as if they were local businesses, and UK businesses and professionals providing services in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> will be regarded as originating from a ‘third country’.</p>

<p>UK firms and service providers may face additional legal, regulatory and administrative barriers as a result.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/providing-services-to-eea-and-efta-countries-after-eu-exit">providing services to <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> countries after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="personal-data">Personal data</h2>

<h3 id="data-protection">Data protection</h3>

<p>Your business will need to make sure it follows data protection law if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<p>If you operate across the EU or exchange personal data with organisations in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, there may be changes that you need to make before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-eu-exit-guidance/leaving-the-eu-without-a-deal-6-steps-to-take">6 step process</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-brexit/data-protection-if-there-s-no-brexit-deal/">data protection guidance from the Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner's Office">ICO</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-brexit/standard-contractual-clauses-for-transfers-from-the-eea-to-the-uk-interactive-tool/">check if you can use standard contractual clauses (<abbr title="standard contractual clauses">SCCs</abbr>)</a> for transfers from the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> to the UK.</p>

<h2 id="operating-in-the-eu">Operating in the EU</h2>

<h3 id="cross-border-business-operations">Cross-border business operations</h3>

<p>If your business operates in the EU you may want to seek professional advice or contact the government of the country in which you operate for more information.</p>

<p>UK companies and limited liability partnerships based in an EU member state may need to restructure to satisfy the requirements for incorporation in that EU member state.</p>

<p>Any UK companies that are carrying out a cross-border merger will need to make sure that they can complete the merger before the UK leaves the EU.  You may want to seek legal advice on your specific case.</p>

<p>UK investors in EU businesses need to be aware of any restrictions within the EU country where they are operating.</p>

<p>Read the guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/structuring-your-business-if-theres-no-brexit-deal--2/structuring-your-business-if-theres-no-brexit-deal#actions-for-businesses-and-other-stakeholders">structuring your business if the UK leaves the EU without a deal</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/home.do?action=home">check the requirements of specific EU countries</a>.</p>
