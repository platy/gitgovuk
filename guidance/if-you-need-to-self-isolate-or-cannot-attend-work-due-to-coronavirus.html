<p><strong>Upcoming changes</strong></p>

<p>The government has published its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-living-with-covid-19">plan for living with COVID-19</a>. This means:</p>

<p><strong>From 24 February</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You will no longer be legally required to self-isolate if you test positive for COVID-19. New guidance will advise people who test positive to stay at home and avoid contact with other people.</li>
  <li>You will no longer be legally required to self-isolate if you are an unvaccinated close contact, and will no longer be advised to test for 7 days if you are a fully vaccinated close contact. New guidance will set out precautions for reducing risk to yourself and others.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance will be updated shortly to include information on the above changes. You should continue to follow all of the guidance on this page to keep yourself and others safe.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for employers and their employees or workers who may not be able to go into work because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they’re self-isolating</li>
  <li>they’re clinically extremely vulnerable</li>
</ul>

<p>It sets out the relevant legal framework around absence and the return to work.</p>

<p>People who may not be attending the workplace during the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone with symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>
</li>
  <li>anyone who’s received a positive test for <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> and needs to self-isolate</li>
  <li>household contacts (including an extended or linked household) of people who have symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> and are required to self-isolate</li>
  <li>household contacts (including an extended or linked household) of people who have had a positive <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> test and are required to self-isolate</li>
  <li>other contacts of people with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> who have been advised to self-isolate by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-workplace-guidance">NHS Test and Trace</a>, by their local authority, or because their employer has asked them to self-isolate due to someone in the workplace testing positive</li>

<h2>Asking your employee or worker to work somewhere other than where they’re self-isolating</h2>

<p>It’s an offence for an employer to knowingly allow a person who is required to self-isolate to work anywhere other than where they are self-isolating (normally their home). This applies only when they’re required to self-isolate following a positive test, contacted by NHS Test and Trace or their local authority, or where they are required to quarantine after returning from abroad.</p>

<p>If an employer is reasonably believed to be in breach of this requirement, they may be issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice (<abbr title="fixed penalty notice">FPN</abbr>). The fine is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£1,000 for a first <abbr title="fixed penalty notice">FPN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>£2,000 for a second <abbr title="fixed penalty notice">FPN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>£4,000 for a third <abbr title="fixed penalty notice">FPN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>£10,000 for a fourth and subsequent <abbr title="fixed penalty notices">FPNs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Telling your employer you’ve tested positive, been contacted by Test and Trace or a local authority, or if you must quarantine</h2>

<p>Anyone who develops <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms should stay at home and self-isolate immediately. Anyone who is due to work outside of the place where they are isolating during the self-isolation period must inform their employer if they’ve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tested positive</li>
  <li>been contacted by NHS Test and Trace or their local authority</li>
  <li>returned from abroad and are required to quarantine</li>
</ul>

<p>An individual can receive a fixed penalty notice of £50 for not doing so.</p>

<h2>Statutory Sick Pay</h2>

<h3>Employees</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay">Find out if you’re eligible for Statutory Sick Pay</a> while you’re self-isolating.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.acas.org.uk/contact" rel="external">Contact Acas</a> if you have questions about your eligibility for Statutory Sick Pay.</p>

<h3>Employers</h3>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay">employer’s guide to Statutory Sick Pay</a>.</p>

<h2>Paid and unpaid leave</h2>

<h3>Employees</h3>

<p>If you are unable to do your job from home, you may ask your employer for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights">annual leave</a> to accommodate your period of self-isolation.</p>

<p>If your employer refuses an annual leave request, you may be able to agree a period of unpaid leave instead.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-what-to-do-if-youre-employed-and-cannot-work#if-youre-off-work-because-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms-or-are-self-isolating-or-shielding">financial support that you could get if you’re off work due to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Employers</h3>

<p>If it is not possible to arrange alternative work that can be completed from home, you should try to accommodate periods of self-isolation by granting annual leave, or unpaid leave if that is not possible.</p>

<h2>Dismissal</h2>

<h3>Employers</h3>

<p>Dismissing an employee who cannot attend work due to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> should be a last resort. You should consider alternative arrangements like facilitating working from home, or agreeing annual leave or unpaid leave.</p>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dismiss-staff">more about dismissing staff</a>.</p>

<p>A dismissal can only be fair if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s for valid reasons, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dismiss-staff/dismissals-on-capability-or-conduct-grounds">capability or conduct</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/staff-redundant">redundancy</a> or other substantial reasons</li>
  <li>those reasons justify dismissal in the particular circumstances</li>
  <li>the employer acted reasonably during the dismissal and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-disciplinary-action">disciplinary process</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An employment tribunal will consider all the relevant facts around a dismissal. This could include public health guidance regarding <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> (including guidance for clinically extremely vulnerable individuals), individual behaviour, the employer’s circumstances and any previous history between the employer and the employee.</p>

<p>In most cases employees must have worked for their employer for 2 years before they’re eligible to claim unfair dismissal. However, where an employee reasonably believes that attending work would create a serious and imminent danger to their health, or to the health of the person they live with, a dismissal based on that person failing to attend work might be considered automatically unfair. Among other things, this removes the condition that you must have worked for your employer for 2 years.</p>

<h4>Dismissing an employee because they’ve followed guidance on self-isolation</h4>

<p>Employers who dismiss an employee because they are, or have been, self-isolating, may be liable for unfair or automatically unfair dismissal. This will depend on all the circumstances of the case. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s unlikely a short period of self-isolation (such as 2 weeks) would in itself make it reasonable to dismiss someone on the grounds the person is not capable of doing their job</li>
  <li>it’s against the law for anyone who’s required to self-isolate to attend work, and for their employer to knowingly allow them attend work - this is likely to be relevant when deciding whether it was reasonable to dismiss them for not going into work</li>
  <li>employees, including those who are clinically extremely vulnerable or live with someone who is, may have valid reasons to believe that attending work would create a serious and imminent danger to their health, or to the health of the person they live with - therefore it could be automatically unfair to dismiss them</li>
</ul>

<p>An employee can be dismissed for legitimate reasons not related to self-isolation. There could be other factors which could support a dismissal being considered a fair dismissal. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if they’re self-isolating after getting or being exposed to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> as a result of breaching a legal prohibition</li>
  <li>capability - if the self-isolation follows a lengthy absence from work where the employee has longer-term health issues preventing them from working</li>
</ul>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dismiss-staff/dismissals-due-to-illness">more about dismissal due to illness</a>.</p>

<h2>Redundancy when someone’s clinically extremely vulnerable</h2>

<p>Redundancy is a form of dismissal carried out when an employer needs to reduce or restructure their workforce.</p>

<p>An employee can be made redundant during or after a period in which they have been advised to shield. However, the redundancy must be fair. The employer must demonstrate that the employee’s job will no longer exist. Employers should always consult employees in a redundancy situation.</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights">guidance for employees on redundancy</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Equality Act</h2>

<h3>Employers</h3>

<p>Employers must make sure that the decisions they take in response to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> do not directly or indirectly discriminate against employees on the grounds of a protected characteristic, for example sex, disability or race. This includes decisions in relation to self-isolation and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, and the return to work. Employers also have obligations towards disabled workers and those who are new or expectant mothers.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Returning safely to the workplace</h2>

<p>Employees and employers should agree when and how an employee will return to the workplace after a period of self-isolation or being unable to attend work (including staying at home as a result of receiving a shielding notification).</p>

<p>Employers are encouraged not to disadvantage staff that return to work after self-isolating following public health guidance. This includes all aspects of fair treatment at work such as reasonable workload, access to training and promotion opportunities.</p>

<h2>More information on employment rights</h2>

<p>Whether an individual qualifies for protection under employment law depends on a variety of factors, such as their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-status">employment status</a> and the specific circumstances of the individual and employer.</p>

<p>Courts and tribunals will make final decisions on employment status as well as whether an employer has acted within the law or not.</p>
