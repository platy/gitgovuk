<p>National applications for UK-wide marketing authorisations are permitted irrespective of whether an application for the same product is approved or has been submitted through the EU decentralised procedures (<abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>) or mutual recognition procedures (<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr>).</p>

<p>This guidance describes the approach the MHRA intends to take for products already approved or that are included in ongoing DCPs or MRPs with UK in respect of NI (UK(NI)) as a Concerned Member State (<abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr>).</p>

<p>All holders of existing marketing authorisations (<abbr title="marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr>), or applicants for <abbr title="marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> with applications under review within a decentralised or mutual recognition procedure with UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr>, have a choice on how to manage their marketing authorisations/applications.</p>

<p>For new applications, UK(NI) may continue to be included in decentralised and mutual recognition procedures as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr>. Any marketing authorisations issued following these procedures will be effective in Northern Ireland only. A separate marketing authorisation application will be needed for Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland).</p>

<h2>Products approved in the UK via <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Products approved via the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr> or <abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> before 1 January 2021 were issued with national UK-wide <abbr title="marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr>. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>) has the option to do one of the following:</p>

<p>a. Maintain a UK-wide marketing authorisation and retain the UK in respect of Northern Ireland (UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr>. In this case, the authorisation will continue to be a UK-wide MA with Northern Ireland as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> and Great Britain aligned with, but not part of, the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr>. This will be the default position and no action will need to be taken by the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>.</p>

<p>b. Notify the UK and the <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> (reference member state) in writing that they wish to remove UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> from the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> and maintain a UK wide national MA.</p>

<p>c. Request that separate <abbr title="marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> are issued for UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr>, and Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland)</p>

<p>With option (a), any subsequent application for a variation to the MA should be submitted through the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr>.
If approved this would apply to the UK-wide marketing authorisation with Great Britain implementing the European decision, unless the MHRA notifies the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> within 30 days of the <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> decision that the decision cannot be accepted in Great Britain. In this case, a separate MA for Great Britain would need to be issued.</p>

<p>With option (b), any subsequent application for a variation to the MA should be submitted as a national (UK) variation.</p>

<p>With option (c), the UK(NI) MA would be managed post approval as a European procedure and the Great Britain MA as a national procedure.</p>

<h2>Products authorised for the UK(NI) via <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Where products have been approved via the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr> or <abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> and have been issued with a national UK(NI) MA valid only in Northern Ireland from 1 January 2021, the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> has the option to do one of the following:</p>

<p>a. Retain UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr>. In this case, the authorisation will continue as a UK(NI) MA. This will be the default position and no action will need to be taken by the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>.  If the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> has a separate UK(GB) MA this will also continue in force.</p>

<p>b. Notify the UK and the <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> in writing that they wish to remove UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> from the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> and request a UK wide national MA from MHRA.</p>

<p>With option (a), any subsequent application for a variation to the MA should be submitted through the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr>.</p>

<p>With option (b), the MHRA will agree with the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> how to manage changes to the route of authorisation and the territorial validity of each MA. Any subsequent application for a variation to the MA should be submitted as a national (UK) variation.</p>

<p>Applications pending in <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> with the UK(NI) as <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> where the procedure started before 1 January 2021
For procedures ongoing in <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> that were started before 1 January 2021 the applicant has the following options:</p>

<p>a. Retain UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr>, and then, at conclusion of a positive procedure with which the UK agrees, either:</p>

<p>(i) have a UK-wide MA issued with UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> and Great Britain aligned with the decision taken by the <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> but not part of the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr>. This will be the default position and no action will need to be taken by the applicant. The MHRA will advise the applicant within 30 days if it is unable to accept the procedure outcome for Great Britain. In this case, separate <abbr title="marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> for UK(NI) and Great Britain would need to be issued, if Great Britain reaches a positive outcome that is different to the outcome in the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr>.</p>

<p>(ii) at the end of procedure, request that separate <abbr title="marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> are issued for UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> (to be managed post approval as a European procedure) and Great Britain (to be managed post approval as a Great Britain national procedure).</p>

<p>b. Notify the UK and <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> in writing that they wish to remove UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> and continue the application as a UK wide national application.</p>

<p>With Option b, the MHRA will complete the assessment as a national UK wide procedure. The MHRA will take into account any assessment that has already been reported by the <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> including any points raised by the <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> and other CMSs.</p>

<p>The MHRA will determine the application as soon as reasonably practicable and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that it makes a decision to grant or refuse the national application in the time period that would have applied to that application on the date on which the application was submitted in <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr>.</p>

<p>No additional fee will be charged for an application already submitted and ongoing in <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> that is completed as a national procedure.</p>

<p>c. Withdraw the application from the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> and apply for a national UK MA on completion of the European procedure using the MRDC Reliance Procedure</p>

<h2>Applications pending in <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> with the UK(NI) as <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> where the procedure started on or after 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>For procedures ongoing in <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> with UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> that were started on or after 1 January 2021 the applicant has the following options:</p>

<p>a. Retain UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> to obtain a UK MA valid only in Northern Ireland.  A separate MA is needed for Great Britain.</p>

<p>b. Notify the UK and <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> in writing that they wish to remove UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> and continue the application as a UK wide national application. If there is already a parallel application to Great Britain the application to NI can be withdrawn and the GB application will continue as a UK wide national application.</p>

<p>The MHRA will take into account any assessment that has already been reported by the <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> including any points raised by the <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr> and other CMSs and determine the application as soon as reasonably practicable.  MHRA will take all reasonable steps to ensure that it makes a decision to grant or refuse the national application in the time period that would have applied to that application on the date on which the application was submitted in <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr>.</p>

<p>No additional fee will be charged for an application already submitted and ongoing in <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> that is completed as a national procedure.</p>

<p>c. Withdraw the application from the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> and apply for a national UK MA on completion of the European procedure using the MRDC Reliance Procedure</p>

<p>Applications submitted in <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> with the UK(NI) as <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr> where the procedure has not started<br>
For <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/MRPs that have been submitted to the UK but have not been started by the <abbr title="Reference Member State">RMS</abbr>, the applicant has the following options:</p>

<p>a. Retain UK(NI) as a <abbr title="Concerned Member State">CMS</abbr>. A separate marketing authorisation application is needed for Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland).</p>

<p>b. Withdraw the application from UK(NI) in the EU procedure and apply as a national procedure in the UK to obtain a UK-wide marketing authorisation.</p>

<p>c. Withdraw the application from the <abbr title="decentralised procedures">DCP</abbr>/<abbr title="mutual recognition procedures">MRP</abbr> and apply for a national MA on completion of the European procedure using the MRDC Reliance Procedure.</p>
