<h2>Hops and hop products produced in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales)</h2>

<p>Certification centres issue hops certificates for hops and hop products produced in Great Britain.</p>

<h3>Certification requirements for hops and hop products</h3>

<p>Hops and hop products that have been grown or processed in Great Britain must be certified by an approved certification centre in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2006/1850/contents" rel="external">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2013/1308/article/77" rel="external">Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013</a>. This is because both regulations apply in GB.</p>

<p>These rules relate to all hops grown in Great Britain and hop products processed in Great Britain, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hop cones</li>
  <li>pellets</li>
  <li>powder</li>
  <li>saps and extracts of hops</li>
  <li>mixed hop products</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some exemptions to the certification requirements for these hop products:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hops harvested on land owned by a brewery and used by that brewery in the natural or processed state</li>
  <li>products derived from hops and processed under contract on behalf of a brewery (provided that those products are used by the brewery itself)</li>
  <li>hops and products derived from hops that are put in small packets for sale to private individuals for their own use – the weight of the package must not exceed 1kg for hop cones or powder, or 300g for extract, powder and the new isomerised products</li>
  <li>products manufactured from isomerised hop products</li>
</ul>

<p>All other hops and hop products grown or processed in GB must be certified in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006. They must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2006/1850" rel="external">comply with the minimum marketing requirements set out in Annex I of the regulation</a>.</p>

<p>Hops can be harvested on land that’s owned by a brewery and used by that brewery in the natural or processed state. For these hops, the brewer must send a declaration to the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) by 15 November each year.</p>

<h3>What your certificate should include</h3>

<p>The certificate issued by the GB certification centre must include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>description of the product</li>
  <li>reference number of the certificate</li>
  <li>net or gross weight (or both)</li>
  <li>hop production area or the place of production</li>
  <li>year of harvesting</li>
  <li>variety</li>
  <li>terms ‘seeded hops’ or ‘seedless hops’ (as appropriate)</li>
  <li>words ‘Certified product – Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006’, which are included on the certificate by the competent certification authority</li>
  <li>place and date of processing (for products prepared from hops)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you require a list of certification centres, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:defrahorticulture@defra.gov.uk">defrahorticulture@defra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Each package of certified hops or hop products must be marked with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>description of the product (including the terms ‘seeded hops’ or ‘seedless hops’ as appropriate and ‘prepared hops’ or ‘unprepared hops’)</li>
  <li>variety or varieties</li>
  <li>reference number of the certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>The certificate should accompany the hops or hop product when marketed in GB. If the hops or hop products are split for resale after certification has taken place, an invoice or commercial documentation referencing the following must accompany the hops or hop product:</p>

<ul>
  <li>certificate reference number</li>
  <li>designation of the product</li>
  <li>gross or net weight (or both)</li>
  <li>place of production</li>
  <li>year of harvest</li>
  <li>variety</li>
  <li>place and date of processing (for products prepared from hops)</li>
</ul>

<p>GB hops certification centres must remove all EU branding from certificates (including references to the EU and the EU emblem).</p>

<p>The certification centre number must be pre-fixed with ‘GB’ instead of ‘UK’. You must update any certificates and official stamps you use.</p>

<p>Wording on official stamps must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>certified product – Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006</li>
  <li>certifying officer signature</li>
  <li>GB hops certificate centre number</li>
</ul>

<h3>Blends of hops and hop products</h3>

<p>Only certified hops originating from Great Britain or certified hop products prepared from certified hops originating from GB, can be blended in the manufacture of powder and extracts.</p>

<p>The certified hops or certified hop products must only be blended in the manufacture, powder or extracts if the hops or hop products are from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the same harvest but are different varieties</li>
  <li>the same harvest but are different hop production areas</li>
</ul>

<p>The certificate accompanying the product must also state the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hop varieties used</li>
  <li>hop production areas</li>
  <li>year of harvesting</li>
  <li>percentage weight of each variety used in the blend</li>
  <li>reference numbers of the certificates issued for the hops and hop products used</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of stating the percentage weight of each hop variety used in the blend, the certificate can state the percentage weight of each variety based on the quantity of cone hops used to prepare the hop products if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hop products are manufactured using hop products and cone hops</li>
  <li>different hop products are used</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importing hops and hop products into Great Britain</h2>

<p>Hops and hop products imported until 30 June 2022 must be accompanied by one of the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EU Attestation of Equivalence (<abbr title="Attestation of Equivalence">AoE</abbr>) issued by an authorised agency listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/GA/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008R1295" rel="external">Annex I of EC Regulation 1295/2008</a>
</li>
  <li>EU certificate from EU member states only, issued by an approved certification centre</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 July 2022, all imports from third countries (EU and non-EU countries) will require a GB <abbr title="Attestation of Equivalence">AoE</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2008/1295/annex/I" rel="external">issued by an authorised agency</a> from the country of origin.</p>

<p>The above requirements do not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>small packages of hops and hop products for sale to private individuals for their own use</li>
  <li>hops and hop products for scientific and technical experiments</li>
  <li>hops and hop products for fairs covered by the special customs arrangements for fairs</li>
</ul>

<p>For hop cones and powder, the weight of the package must not exceed 1kg. For hop extracts, the weight of the package must not exceed 300g.</p>

<p>The description, weight and final usage of the product must appear on the packaging.</p>

<h2>Importing hops and hop products from the EU to Northern Ireland (NI)</h2>

<p>There is no change to the marketing standards requirements for importing hops and hop products from the EU to NI.</p>

<p>Hops and hop products marketed in Northern Ireland must be covered by either an:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EU certificate issued in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02006R1850-20130701&amp;qid=1610990006200" rel="external">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006</a> (as this regulation applies in the EU)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Attestation of Equivalence">AoE</abbr> issued in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02008R1295-20151116&amp;qid=1610989204256" rel="external">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1295/2008</a> (as this regulation applies in the EU) – you need an <abbr title="Attestation of Equivalence">AoE</abbr> if the hops or hop products are imported into the EU from a non-EU country</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hops and hop products of EU origin</h3>

<p>An invoice or commercial documentation must accompany hops or hop products if both the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hops or hop products have been EU certified</li>
  <li>consignment has been split in an EU member state for resale after certification</li>
</ul>

<p>The commercial documentation must include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EU certificate number</li>
  <li>designation of the product</li>
  <li>gross or net weight (or both)</li>
  <li>place of production</li>
  <li>year of harvest</li>

<ul>
  <li>hops or hop products are of third country origin</li>
  <li>consignment has been split for resale after release into free circulation into the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Free circulation’ means that before the hops or hop products are marketed or sold within the EU:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a customs entry must be raised for the hops or hop products</li>
  <li>duty or VAT must be paid</li>
</ul>

<p>The commercial documentation must include the:</p>

<ul>

</li>
  <li>part of a consignment that’s been split up in an EU member state before it’s released into free circulation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moving hops and hop products from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h2>

<p>There is no change to the requirements for moving hops and hop products from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.</p>

<p>To be marketed in Great Britain, the hops or hop products must have been issued either an:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EU certificate supplied by an approved EU certification centre, in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2006/1850/contents" rel="external">Commission Regulation (EC) No 1850/2006</a> (as this regulation applies in the EU)</li>

<h2>Exporting hops and hop products from Great Britain to the EU</h2>

<p>You must comply with EU third country import requirements to export hops and hop products from Great Britain to the EU. Third country means countries that are not in the EU.</p>
