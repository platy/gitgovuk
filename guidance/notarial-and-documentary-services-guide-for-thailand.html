<h2>Services we cannot provide</h2>

<h3>Visa extension letters</h3>

<p>There are a range of visa extension options available under Thai immigration rules.</p>

<p>Thai Immigration Bureau does not require a letter from an embassy in order to consider an application to extend or renew a visa. You may be able to complete an affidavit or provide additional documents to support a visa application at your local Immigration Office.</p>

<p>If you are currently in Thailand and not able to extend or change your visa to an alternative you should discuss your options with your local Immigration Office. This may include having to leave Thailand.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.immigration.go.th/" rel="external">Visit the Thai Immigration website</a> for further information on visa extension options.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/entry-requirements">Information on visa requirements for Thailand are available from FCDO Travel Advice Thailand</a>.</p>

<h3>Certified copies of UK birth, death, marriage or degree/educational certificates.</h3>
<p>Thai authorities require documents issued outside of Thailand to be authenticated. The only authority permitted to provide this service is the Legalisation Office of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in the UK.</p>

<p>Before arriving in Thailand you are advised to get your UK certificates legalised before you travel. If you are already in Thailand you will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="#services-provided-elsewhere">follow the 3 step legalisation process under services provided elsewhere</a>.</p>
