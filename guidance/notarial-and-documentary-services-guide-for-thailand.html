<h3>Legalising a signature or seal</h3>

<p>Legalisation is the official confirmation that a signature, seal or stamp on an official public document is genuine. UK public documents such as birth, death, marriage and divorce certificates can be legalised by the UK government in the UK. This is also known as an apostille.</p>

<p>More information on how to get your UK document legalised for use in Thailand can be found on <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/714089/Legalisation_info_June_2018.pdf">Three Steps of Legalising a Signatures or Seal</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">157 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">1 page</span>)</span> and <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/714090/Legalisation_info_graphic_June_2018.pdf">Legalisation Infographic</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">448 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">1 page</span>)</span>.</p>

<h3>Life Certificates</h3>

<p>We do not provide life certificates for British nationals claiming a British pension abroad. Someone in a recognised profession can witness your life certificate if you are claiming State Pension abroad. They do not need to live in the UK, or have a British passport. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications/accepted-occupations-for-countersignatories">list of people who can sign the form are the same as those who can ‘countersign’ a passport photo</a>.</p>

<h3>Recognition or validity of marriage</h3>

<p>We do not provide a recognition of marriage document. Only Courts in England and Wales can recognise a marriage under English and Welsh Law, for more information see <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/959371/recognition_of_marriage_001.pdf">Information Note on Recognition or Validity of Marriage</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">465 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">1 page</span>)</span>.</p>

<h2>Services we cannot provide</h2>

<h3>Visa extension letters</h3>

<p>There are a range of visa extension options available under Thai immigration rules.</p>

<p>Thai Immigration Bureau does not require a letter from an embassy in order to consider an application to extend or renew a visa. You may be able to complete an affidavit or provide additional documents to support a visa application at your local Immigration Office.</p>

<p>If you are currently in Thailand and not able to extend or change your visa to an alternative you should discuss your options with your local Immigration Office. This may include having to leave Thailand.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.immigration.go.th/" rel="external">Visit the Thai Immigration website</a> for further information on visa extension options.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/entry-requirements">Information on visa requirements for Thailand are available from FCDO Travel Advice Thailand</a>.</p>

<h3>Income letters for Thai Immigration</h3>
<p>The British Embassy does not provide letters confirming income. If you are required to show evidence of as part of a visa application or extension of stay, you can provide your Thai bank account showing the required deposit(s).</p>

<h3>Certified copies of UK birth, death, marriage or degree/educational certificates.</h3>
<p>Thai authorities require documents issued outside of Thailand to be authenticated. The only authority permitted to provide this service is the Legalisation Office of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in the UK.</p>

<p>Before arriving in Thailand you are advised to get your UK certificates legalised before you travel. If you are already in Thailand you will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="#services-provided-elsewhere">follow the 3 step legalisation process under services provided elsewhere</a>.</p>

<h3>Any form of affirmation, affidavit or statutory declaration to confirm identity, family relationships or marital status</h3>

<p>Unless it is to marry in Thailand, then <a class="govuk-link" href="#affirmation-for-the-purpose-of-marriage-under-thai-law">follow the steps above for Affirmation of Marital Status.</a></p>

<h3>Witness a signature on a Power of Attorney</h3>
