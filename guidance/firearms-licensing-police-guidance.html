<h3>12 March 2015: notice of a change to the cost of firearms licensing fees</h3>

<p>From 6 April 2015 there will be new fees charged by the police for administering firearms licences. This follows the public consultation held in November and December 2014.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/a-proposal-to-increase-firearms-licensing-fees-administered-by-the-police">response to the government consultation</a> on increasing firearms licensing fees administered by the police - which includes details on the new fees - is available.</p>

<h3>22 December 2014: notice of a change in law affecting registered firearms dealers and computerised records – EU Weapons Directive 2008/51.</h3>

<p>The Home Office has revisited its position on the implementation of article 4(4) of the EU Weapons Directive 2008/51 (amending Council Directive 91/477).  We do appreciate that it is not ideal to be changing our approach at this late stage.  However we have reconsidered the scope of the requirements and have decided that rather than mandating firearms dealers to computerise their records we will rely on the National Firearms Licensing Management System (England and Wales) and SHOGUN (Scotland), with both the police and firearms dealers continuing to record current information.</p>

<p>This means that firearms dealers can continue to keep paper-based records although we would continue to recommend computerised records as a matter of best practice.</p>

<p>Firearms dealers will not be required to record anything more or less than they are already required to do now but records will need to kept and maintained for a minimum of 20 years.</p>

<p>The requirements for what has to be recorded as part of the directive are already covered by section 40 and schedule 4 of the Firearms Act 1968 and Part IV of Schedule 5 to the Firearms Rules 1998. Therefore the only difference for firearms dealers will be the length of time they must hold their records for.</p>

<p>Please note that there is no requirement for registered firearms dealers trading only in air weapons or ammunition to comply with this EU Directive. If you have any questions please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:public.enquiries@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk">public.enquiries@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk</a>, or read the further information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-registered-firearms-dealers-and-computerised-records">the new legislation</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Firearms Act 1968</h3>

<p>From 14 July 2014, if a person receives a suspended sentence of 3 months or more they will not be able to purchase or possess a firearm or ammunition for a period of 5 years from the second day after sentence.</p>

<p>From 14 July 2014, a person who has served or received a criminal sentence will not be able to possess an antique firearm.</p>

<p>The prohibition applies to anyone who has served a custodial sentence of more than 3 years or has served a custodial sentence, or received a suspended sentence, of between 3 months and 3 years.</p>

<p>A person to whom this applies and who currently lawfully possesses an antique firearm will need to dispose of it by 14 July.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>On 18 November 2015 the EU Commission published proposals to amend the Firearms Directive 91/477/EEC as amended by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_15_6110" rel="external">Directive 2008/51/EC</a>. You can read the <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/517032/Draft_Amending_Directive.pdf">Draft amending directive</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">308 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">19 pages</span>)</span>. Negotiations on the directive are ongoing.</p>

<p>Further information will be added to this page when it is available.</p>

<h3>Travelling to EU countries with deactivated weapons for historical re-enactments and commemorative events</h3>

<p>If you are travelling to an EU country with deactivated weapons, these must conform to the technical specifications set out in the EU Implementing Regulation on deactivation standards which came into effect on 8 April.</p>

<p>If you are returning to the UK you will also need to comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deactivated-firearms-implementing-regulation-eu-20152403">additional measures required by the UK</a>. Weapons deactivated to other standards must not be taken to other EU countries, nor will they be admitted into the UK.</p>

<p>The Proof Houses are aware of the likely increase in demand for their services and the urgency of such requests in relation to the centenary anniversary of the Battle of the Somme and related events. Re-enactment and living history societies and individuals should contact the relevant Proof House as soon as possible and tell them of the numbers and types of firearms which need certifying. The Proof House will endeavour to meet requests ahead of travel but cannot guarantee all firearms will be certified in time.</p>

<p>All costs incurred as a result of this certification must be met by the owners of the deactivated weapons. The government will not provide any financial assistance to cover these costs and it will not provide compensation for any claims arising as a result of the additional certification requirement.</p>

<p>The onus remains on individuals to check with the relevant authority if import licenses are need before travelling with deactivated. Please read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/983345/Notice_to_importers_2944_-_firearms_and_ammunition.pdf" rel="external">importing deactivated weapons back into the UK</a>.</p>
