<h2>17 May: What’s changed:</h2>

<p>Restrictions have been eased following the move to step 3. However we must continue to exercise caution. You should follow this guidance on what you can and cannot do. <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/364/contents/made">It is underpinned by law and applies across England</a>.</p>

<p>You should also follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">how to stop the spread of coronavirus at all times</a>, including if you have been vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>

<p>You should continue to work from home if you can. When travelling within the UK, you should aim to do so safely and plan your journey in advance.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/">get a test</a> and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a> if you have COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gathering limits have been eased. Outdoor gatherings are limited to 30 people and indoor gatherings are limited to 6 people or 2 households (each household can include a support bubble, if eligible).</li>
  <li>New guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-friends-and-family-covid-19" class="govuk-link">meeting friends and family</a> emphasises personal responsibility rather than government rules. Instead of instructing you to stay 2m apart from anyone you don’t live with, you are encouraged to exercise caution and consider the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance on risks associated with COVID-19 and actions you can take</a> to help keep you and your loved ones safe. Remember that the risks of close contact may be greater for some people than others and in some settings and circumstances, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">there will be specific guidance that you will need to follow even when you are with friends and family</a>.</li>
  <li>Indoor entertainment and attractions such as cinemas, theatres, concert halls, bowling alleys, casinos, amusement arcades, museums and children’s indoor play areas are permitted to open with COVID-secure measures in place.</li>
  <li>People can attend indoor and outdoor events, including live performances, sporting events and business events. Attendance at these events is capped according to venue type, and attendees should follow the COVID-secure measures set out by those venues.</li>
  <li>Indoor hospitality venues such as restaurants, pubs, bars and cafes can reopen.</li>
  <li>Organised indoor sport can take place for all. This includes gym classes. It must be organised by a business, charity or public body and the organiser must take reasonable measures to reduce the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>All holiday accommodation can open, including hotels and B&amp;Bs. This can be used by groups of up to 6 or 2 households (each household can include a support bubble, if eligible).</li>
  <li>Funeral attendance is no longer be limited to 30 people, but will be determined by how many people the COVID-secure venue can safely accommodate with social distancing. Limits at weddings, wakes and other commemorative events have been increased to 30 people. Other significant life events, such as bar/bat mitzvahs and christenings, will also be able to take place with 30 people.</li>
  <li>The rules for care home residents visiting out and receiving visitors have changed, allowing up to five named visitors (two at any one time), provided visitors test negative for COVID-19.</li>
  <li>All higher education students are able to access in-person teaching.</li>
  <li>Support groups and parent and child group gathering limits have been increased to 30 people (not including under 5s)</li>
  <li>There is no longer a legal restriction or permitted reason required to travel internationally. A traffic light system for international travel has been introduced, and you must follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england">rules when returning to England depending on whether you return from a red, amber or green list country</a>.</li>

<p>The new COVID-19 variant spreads more easily from person to person. To help stop the spread, you should take particular caution when meeting anyone outside your household or support bubble.</p>

<p>In the areas listed above, wherever possible, you should try to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet outside rather than inside where possible</li>
  <li>keep 2 metres apart from people that you don’t live with (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">unless you have formed a support bubble</a> with them), this includes friends and family you don’t live with</li>
  <li>minimise travel in and out of affected areas</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get tested twice a week for free and isolate if you are positive</li>
  <li>Continue to work from home if you can</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/" class="govuk-link">Get vaccinated</a> when you are offered it, and encourage others to do so as well</li>
  <li>Refer to local health advice for your area (linked above)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should get tested for COVID-19. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">Arranging to have a PCR test</a> if you have symptoms of COVID-19</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>You should self-isolate immediately if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#symptoms">symptoms</a> or a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/test-results/positive-test-result/#:~:text=A%20positive%20result%20means%20it%27s,type%20of%20test%20you%20had." class="govuk-link">positive test result for COVID-19</a>.

<h2>Keeping yourself and others safe</h2>

<h3>Face coverings</h3>

<p>You must wear a face covering in many indoor settings, such as shops and places of worship, and on public transport, unless you are exempt or have a reasonable excuse. This is the law. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">Read guidance on face coverings</a>.</p>

<h3>If you are clinically extremely vulnerable</h3>

<p>If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, you could be at higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus.</p>

<p>If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, you are no longer advised to shield. However, you should continue to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance for people who are clinically extremely vulnerable</a> and are advised to continue taking extra precautions to protect yourself, such as limiting close contacts, shopping or travelling at quieter times of the day, keeping rooms ventilated and washing your hands regularly  Your employer is required to take steps to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace.</p>

<h3>If you have been vaccinated against COVID-19</h3>

<p>To help protect yourself and your friends, family, and community you should continue to follow all of the guidance on this page even if you’ve been <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae" rel="external" class="govuk-link">vaccinated against COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>The vaccines have been shown to reduce the likelihood of severe illness in most people. Like all medicines, no vaccine is completely effective, so those who have received the vaccine should continue to take recommended precautions to avoid infection.</p>

<p>Whilst emerging evidence suggests vaccines are having an impact on transmission, we do not know by how much the vaccine stops COVID-19 from spreading. Even if you have been vaccinated, you could still spread COVID-19 to others, even if you do not display symptoms.</p>

<h2>Getting tested for COVID-19</h2>

<p>Rapid lateral flow testing is now available free to anybody without symptoms. You can get your tests from pharmacies, testing sites, employers, schools, colleges and universities.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Find out more about how to get rapid lateral flow tests</a></p>

<p>Testing twice a week will help make sure you don’t have COVID-19, reducing the risk to those around you.</p>

<p>If you have symptoms you should continue to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a PCR test</a>. If you’re not sure, you can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/">find out which coronavirus test you should get</a>.</p>

<p>You must self isolate if you test positive. Do not meet up with others and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">follow the stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Meeting family and friends outdoors</h2>

<p>You should continue to minimise the number of people you meet within a short period of time to limit the risk of spreading coronavirus (COVID-19). Most restrictions on meeting people outdoors have been lifted, but gatherings must not exceed 30 people unless covered by a legal exemption, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the purposes of work or volunteering</li>
  <li>to provide care or assistance for disabled or vulnerable people</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are meeting friends and family, you can make a personal choice on whether to keep your distance from them, but you should still be cautious. You should read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-friends-and-family-covid-19">meeting friends and family</a>.</p>

<h2>Meeting friends and family indoors (rule of 6)</h2>

<p>It is safer to meet people outdoors. This is because COVID-19 spreads much more easily indoors. However, you can meet up indoors with friends and family you do not live with, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in a group of up to 6 from any number of households (children of all ages count towards the limit of 6)</li>
  <li>in a group of any size from up to two households (each household can include an existing support bubble, if eligible)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are meeting friends and family, you can make a personal choice on whether to keep your distance from them, but you should still be cautious. You should read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-friends-and-family-covid-19" class="govuk-link">meeting friends and family</a>.</p>

<h3>If you’re in a support bubble</h3>

<p>If you are eligible to form a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubble</a>, you and your support bubble count as one household towards the limit of 2 households when meeting others indoors. This means, for example, that you and your support bubble can meet with another household, even if the total group size is more than 6 people.</p>

<h3>Where you can meet indoors</h3>

<p>You can meet in a group of 6 or a larger group of any size from up to 2 households (including their support bubbles) indoors in places such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>private homes</li>
  <li>retail</li>
  <li>indoor hospitality venues, such as restaurants, bars and cafes</li>
  <li>indoor sports and leisure facilities, such as gyms, sports courts, and swimming pools</li>
  <li>personal care, such as spas</li>
  <li>indoor entertainment and visitor attractions, such as museums, theatres, and indoor play areas</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to follow guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19">on how to stop the spread of COVID-19, such as letting in fresh air</a>.</p>

<h3>When you can meet with more people</h3>

<p>Gatherings above the limit of 6 people or 2 households indoors can only take place if they are covered by a legal exemption, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>organised parent and child groups or support groups which can be attended by up to 30 people</li>
  <li>for the purposes of work or volunteering. This means, for example, a tradesperson can go into a household without breaking the limit if they are there for work</li>
  <li>to provide care or assistance for disabled or vulnerable people, including shopping for essential items and accessing services on their behalf.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Support bubbles</h2>

<p>Up to 6 people from different households or a larger group of up to 2 households can meet indoors without the need for a formal childcare arrangement such as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">childcare bubble</a>.</p>

<p>If you are eligible to form a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubble</a>, you and your support bubble count as one household towards the limit of 2 households when meeting others indoors. See the separate guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubbles</a>.</p>

<h2>Going to work</h2>

<p>You should continue to work from home where you can.</p>

<p>If you cannot work from home you should continue to travel to your workplace. You do not need to be classed as a critical worker to go to work if you cannot work from home.</p>

<p>Employers and employees should discuss their working arrangements, and employers should take every possible step to facilitate their employees working from home, including providing suitable IT and equipment to enable remote working. Where people cannot work from home, employers should take steps to make their workplaces COVID-19 secure and help employees avoid busy times and routes on public transport. Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk.</p>

<p>COVID-secure rules, including social distancing requirements, continue to apply in the workplace. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">COVID-secure guidelines</a> are available for sectors across the economy to substantially reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reopening-businesses-and-venues-in-england/reopening-businesses-and-venues" class="govuk-link">See guidance for restrictions on businesses and venues in England</a></p>

<h3>Meeting others for work</h3>

<p>You can gather in a group larger than six people or two households  indoors or in a group larger than 30 people outdoors where it is necessary for your work. When working, you should remain 2 metres from anyone you do not live with, or at least 1m with additional mitigations.</p>

<h3>Working in other people’s homes</h3>

<p>Where it is reasonably necessary for you to work in other people’s homes you can continue to do so, for example if you’re a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nanny</li>
  <li>cleaner</li>
  <li>tradesperson</li>
  <li>social care worker providing support to children and families</li>
</ul>

<p>You should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/homes">guidance on working in other people’s homes</a>.</p>

<p>Where a work meeting does not need to take place in a private home or garden, it should not.</p>

<h3>If you are clinically extremely vulnerable or live with someone who is clinically extremely vulnerable</h3>

<p>If you have been identified as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19" class="govuk-link">clinically extremely vulnerable</a> then you should continue to work from home where possible. If you cannot work from home, you can go to your workplace. Your employer is required to take steps to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace and should be able to explain to you the measures they have put in place to keep you safe at work. Some employers may introduce regular testing of employees as part of these measures. You may also want to consider how you get to and from work, for example, if it is possible to avoid using public transport during rush hour.</p>

<p>If you live with someone who is clinically extremely vulnerable then you can continue to go to work if you are unable to work from home. As an employer, you should make sure suitable arrangements are in place so that they can work safely. You should consider whether clinically extremely vulnerable individuals can take on an alternative role or change their working patterns temporarily to avoid travelling during busy periods. </p>

<p>You should follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">how to stop the spread of coronavirus</a>, including what to do to reduce your risk of catching or passing on the virus at home.</p>

<h2>Support groups</h2>

<p>Support groups can take place with up to 30 participants where officially organised to provide mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support. Support groups must be organised by a business, charity or public body and if taking place indoors, must not take place in a private home.</p>

<p>There is further guidance on how to run or attend a support group safely within the guidance for the safe use of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-multi-purpose-community-facilities/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-multi-purpose-community-facilities" class="govuk-link">multi-purpose community facilities</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of support groups include those that provide support to:</p>

<h2>Exercise, sport and physical activity</h2>

<p>You can do unlimited exercise but there are limits on the number of people you can exercise with. You can exercise in a group of up to 30 people when outdoors. When indoors, you can exercise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on your own</li>
  <li>in a group of up to 6 people</li>

<h3>Elite sportspeople</h3>

<p>Elite sportspeople (or those on an official elite sports pathway) can meet in larger groups, including indoors, to compete and train. They can be joined by their coaches if necessary, or their parents and guardians if they’re under 18.</p>

<h2>Funerals and linked commemorative events</h2>

<p>There is no longer a maximum limit of 30 attendees at funerals. The number of people who can attend a funeral will be determined by how many people the venue can safely accommodate with social distancing measures in place.</p>

<p>Funerals are especially important events to the family and friends of the deceased and this is reflected in the fact that throughout the pandemic, funerals have had higher numerical limits than other life events.</p>

<p>Linked religious or belief-based commemorative events, such as wakes, stone settings and ash scatterings can be attended by a maximum of 30 people, not including anyone working. Commemorative events can take place in a COVID-19 Secure indoor venue, or outdoors including private gardens.</p>

<p>There is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic">guidance for arranging or going to a funeral during the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p>

<h2>Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies and receptions</h2>

<h2>Significant life events</h2>

<p>Significant life events such as christenings or Bar/Bat Mitzvahs can also be attended by a maximum of 30 people. Anyone working is not counted in these limits.</p>

<h2>Places of worship</h2>

<p>You can go to places of worship for a service. When a service is taking place indoors you must not mingle in groups larger than 6, except when everyone present is from no more than 2 households (including support bubbles). You should maintain social distancing between groups at all times.</p>

<p>When a service is taking place outdoors, you must not mingle in groups larger than 30. You should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-during-the-pandemic-from-4-july" class="govuk-link">national guidance on the safe use of places of worship</a>.</p>

<h2>Volunteering and charitable services</h2>

<p>Gatherings above the limit of 6 people or 2 households indoors, or above 30 people outdoors can take place for the purposes of providing voluntary or charitable services.</p>

<h2>Other circumstances where you can gather in larger groups</h2>

<p>Larger gatherings mean they are above the limit of 6 people or 2 households indoors, or above 30 people outdoors.</p>

<p>You may gather in larger groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to provide emergency assistance, and to avoid injury or illness, or to escape a risk of harm (including domestic abuse)</li>
  <li>to fulfil legal obligations</li>
  <li>to carry out activities related to buying, selling or moving house</li>
  <li>for the purpose of COVID-secure protests or picketing where the organiser has taken the required precautions, including completing a risk assessment</li>
