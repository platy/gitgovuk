<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>England has returned to Plan A.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The government is no longer asking people to work from home if they can. People should now talk to their employers to agree arrangements to return to the office.</li>
  <li>Face coverings are no longer advised for staff and pupils in secondary school and college classrooms.</li>
  <li>Face coverings are no longer advised for staff and pupils in communal areas of secondary schools, nor for staff in communal areas of primaries.</li>
  <li>There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</li>
  <li>Venues and events are no longer required by law to check visitors’ NHS COVID Pass. The NHS COVID Pass can still be used on a voluntary basis.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>COVID-19 remains a risk</h2>

<p>It is still possible to catch and spread COVID-19, even if you are fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test result should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home</a> and self-isolate immediately. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should arrange to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">take a PCR test</a> as soon as possible, even if you’ve had one or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>COVID-19 will be a feature of our lives for the foreseeable future, so we need to learn to live with it and manage the risk to ourselves and others.</p>

<p>All of us can play our part by understanding the situations where risks of COVID-19 infection and transmission are likely to be higher, and taking action to reduce these risks.</p>

<p>Following this guidance will help you to understand situations where there is a greater risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 and the steps that you can take to stay safe and protect others. Every action you can take to help reduce the spread will help reduce pressure on the NHS during the winter months.</p>

<h2>Understanding the risks of COVID-19</h2>

<p>The risk of catching or passing on COVID-19 can be higher in certain places and when doing certain activities. COVID-19 is spread by airborne transmission, close contact via droplets, and via surfaces. Airborne transmission is a very significant way that the virus circulates. It is possible to be infected by someone you don’t have close contact with, especially if you’re in a crowded and/or poorly ventilated space.</p>

<p>Close contact with an infected person is also a significant way COVID-19 is spread. When someone with COVID-19 breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they release particles containing the virus that causes COVID-19. The particles can come into contact with the eyes, nose or mouth or can be breathed in by another person. The particles can also land on surfaces and be passed from person to person via touch.</p>

<p>In general, the risk of catching or passing on COVID-19 is higher in crowded and enclosed spaces, where there are more people who might be infectious and limited fresh air.</p>

<p>In situations where there is a higher risk of catching or passing on COVID-19, you should be particularly careful to follow the guidance on keeping yourself and others safe. Every little action helps to keep us all safer.</p>

<h2>Keeping yourself and others safe</h2>

<p>There are still cases of COVID-19 in England and there is a risk you could catch or pass on the virus, even once you are fully vaccinated. This means it is important that you understand and consider the risks of catching or spreading COVID-19 in all situations.</p>

<p>While no situation is risk free, there are easy and effective actions you can take to protect yourself and others around you.</p>

<p>If you are worried about going back to a more ‘normal’ life, there is information from the NHS on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/coronavirus/tips-to-cope-with-anxiety-lockdown-lifting/">how to cope with anxiety about lockdown lifting</a>.</p>

<h2>Get vaccinated</h2>

<p>All adults in England have now been offered at least 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccines are safe and effective. Getting fully vaccinated is the best way of protecting you and others against COVID-19.</p>

<p>If you have not yet received the COVID-19 vaccine, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/" rel="external">get vaccinated</a>. Evidence indicates that 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine provide very effective protection against hospitalisation. It usually takes around 2 to 3 weeks for your body to develop its protective response.</p>

<p>To maintain this high level of protection you should also get a booster vaccine for COVID-19. This is an essential part of ensuring immune defence.</p>

<p>However, even if you have been fully vaccinated, you could still get COVID-19 and pass it on to others. Whilst the vaccines provide a high level of protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death, a recent UKHSA report shows that around 1 in 5 people who have had both doses are still vulnerable to getting infected with the Delta variant and showing symptoms. You can also still spread COVID-19 to others. We all need to do what we can to reduce the spread of COVID-19 to protect others and to reduce the risk of new variants developing and spreading.</p>

<p>Following the advice in this guidance will help you to protect your friends, family, and communities, including those who have been vaccinated.</p>

<h2>Get tested and self-isolate if required</h2>

<h3>If you have symptoms or test positive</h3>

<p>If you develop <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">COVID-19 symptoms</a>, self-isolate immediately and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a PCR test</a>, even if your symptoms are mild. This is because many people experience mild symptoms from COVID-19, but may still pass on the virus to others.</p>

<p>The main symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell</li>
</ul>

<p>You should self-isolate at home while you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a PCR test</a> and wait for the results. You must self-isolate from the day your symptoms started, or from the day you receive a positive test result if you do not have any symptoms. You can end your self-isolation on the sixth day of self-isolation following 5 full days isolating and 2 negative rapid lateral flow test tests taken on consecutive days.</p>

<p>The first rapid lateral flow test should not be taken before the fifth day. The self-isolation period remains 10 full days for those without negative results from 2 rapid lateral flow tests taken a day apart. This is the law, regardless of whether you have been vaccinated. Self-isolating is important because you could pass the infection on to others, even if you do not have symptoms. You must self-isolate for the full amount of time you are told to, because this is the period when the virus is most likely to be passed on to others.</p>

<p>If you have received a positive rapid lateral flow test result but do not have any of the main symptoms of COVID-19, you should report your result and self-isolate. You do not need to take a follow-up PCR test unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you wish to claim the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/test-and-trace-support-payment">Test and Trace Support Payment</a>
</li>
  <li>you have a health condition that means you may be suitable for new COVID-19 treatments</li>
  <li>you are taking rapid lateral flow tests as part of research or surveillance programmes, and the programme asks you to do so</li>
  <li>you are an international arrival and have a positive day 2 rapid lateral flow test</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace</h3>

<p>You must also self-isolate if you are told to do so by NHS Test and Trace. Find out:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Guidance on self-isolating</h3>

<p>When self-isolating, follow the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance for people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">stay at home guidance for non-household contacts of people with confirmed COVID-19</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This will help reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 to other members of your household and community. In both cases you must isolate at all times and not have contact with other people. There are only very limited circumstances when you do not have to do this, such as seeking medical assistance. If you do leave your home during your period of self-isolation for a permitted reason, you should maintain social distancing, keep 2 metres apart from other people, and wear a face covering where possible.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a one-off payment of £500 through the NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme if you are required to stay at home and self-isolate, or you are the parent or guardian of a child who has been told to self-isolate. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">visit your local authority website</a> for information on Test and Trace Support Payments and other practical support offered in your area including help accessing food. If you require prescription medication there is a medicine delivery service available through pharmacies and dispensing GPs.</p>

<p>You could be fined if you do not self-isolate after being told to by NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<h3>Self-isolation exemptions</h3>

<p>You’re <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#exemptions-from-self-isolation-for-contacts" class="govuk-link">not required to self-isolate</a> if you live in the same household as someone with COVID-19, or are a close contact of someone with COVID-19, and any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re fully vaccinated</li>
  <li>you’re below the age of 18 years and 6 months</li>
  <li>you’ve taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial</li>
  <li>you’re not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are aged 5 years and over and have been identified as a contact of someone with COVID-19, and you are not legally required to self-isolate, you are now strongly advised to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a lateral flow test every day for 7 days</li>
  <li>take this daily lateral flow test before you leave your home for the first time that day</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these lateral flow tests are positive, you should immediately self-isolate in order to protect other people.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works">NHS Test and Trace will contact you</a> to let you know that you have been identified as a contact and check whether you are legally required to self-isolate.</p>

<p>If you have previously received a positive COVID-19 PCR test result, you are not usually advised to be re-tested within 90 days of this result.</p>

<p>However, you should have a PCR test within 90 days of a previous positive PCR test if you develop any new symptoms of COVID-19 or you are required to take a PCR test upon entry into the UK.</p>

<p>If you are tested within 90 days of a positive PCR test result for either of these reasons, and the PCR test result is positive, you must self-isolate and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>You can find further <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">guidance for household contacts</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">guidance for non-household contacts</a> of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections.</p>

<h2>Let fresh air in if you meet indoors. Meeting outdoors is safer</h2>

<p>When a person infected with COVID-19 coughs, talks or breathes, they release droplets and aerosols which can be breathed in by another person. Meeting outdoors vastly reduces the risk of airborne transmission, but this may not always be possible. If you’re indoors, you should let fresh air in to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.</p>

<p>The more fresh air you let into your home or other enclosed spaces, the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles.</p>

<p>You can let in fresh air by uncovering vents and opening doors and windows. Opening your windows for just 10 minutes, or a small amount of time continuously where you can, makes a significant difference. This is particularly important before, during, and after meeting people you do not live with indoors.</p>

<p>Do not prop fire doors open. If you have an extractor fan at home, for example in your bathroom or kitchen, think about leaving it running for longer than usual with the door closed after someone has used the room. If you are concerned about the costs of heating, opening windows for shorter periods of time can still help to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. Wearing extra layers can help you to keep warm. You may be able to change the layout of your room so that you do not sit close to cold draughts from open windows or doors.</p>

<p>There is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus">guidance for the public on how to ventilate indoor spaces to stop the spread of COVID-19, including if someone is self isolating</a>. This includes advice on how to claim financial and practical help on heating your home.</p>

<h2>Wear a face covering</h2>

<p>COVID-19 spreads through the air by droplets and aerosols that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person. Whilst there is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering, the Government suggests that you continue to wear one in crowded and enclosed spaces, especially where you come into contact with people you do not usually meet. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#introduction" class="govuk-link">Find out more information about face coverings</a>.</p>

<h2>Working from home</h2>

<p>The government is no longer asking people to work from home. People should now talk to their employers to agree arrangements to return to the office.</p>

<h2>NHS COVID Pass</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass allows people to demonstrate their COVID-19 status to venues that decide to ask for it as a condition of entry. The app will allow people to generate a barcode that demonstrates that they are either fully vaccinated, have recorded a negative test result in the previous 48 hours, or are exempt from vaccination.</p>

<p>Venues and events are no longer required by law to check visitors’ NHS COVID Pass. However, some venues where large crowds gather or are in close contact may choose to continue to check the COVID-19 status of attendees and the workforce to keep everyone safer. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass" class="govuk-link">Find out more about using the NHS Covid Pass</a>.</p>

<h2>Take a test if you do not have symptoms to help manage your risk</h2>

<p>Around 1 in 3 people with COVID-19 do not have any symptoms. This means they could be spreading the virus without knowing it. Testing regularly increases the chances of detecting COVID-19 when you are infectious but are not displaying symptoms, helping to make sure you do not spread COVID-19 by staying at home and self-isolating immediately.</p>

<p>Rapid lateral flow testing continues to be available free of charge. You can get tests from pharmacies or online. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/">Find out more about how to get rapid lateral flow tests</a>.</p>

<p>You are at higher risk of catching or passing on COVID-19 in crowded and enclosed spaces, where there are more people who might be infectious and where there is limited fresh air.</p>

<p>You may wish to take a rapid lateral flow test if it is expected there will be a period of high risk that day. This is particularly important if you expect that there will be a period of high risk that day. This includes spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/who-is-at-high-risk-from-coronavirus/">people who are at higher risk of severe illness if they get COVID-19</a>. Report your result and if positive, self-isolate immediately and take a PCR test.</p>

<p>Certain places such as health and social care settings, schools and prisons have their own specific testing rules and guidance. You should always make sure you are aware of this guidance if you visit or work in these places.</p>

<h2>Try to stay at home if you’re feeling unwell</h2>

<p>If you develop <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">COVID-19 symptoms</a>, self-isolate immediately and <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link">get a PCR test</a>, even if your symptoms are mild. You should self-isolate at home while you book the test and wait for the results. You must self-isolate if you test positive.</p>

<p>If you feel unwell but do not have COVID-19 symptoms, or your COVID-19 test is negative, you may still have an illness which could be passed on to other people. Many common illnesses, like the flu or the common cold, are spread from one person to another. This can happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when someone infected with an illness breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, releasing respiratory particles which can cause infection in another person</li>
  <li>through surfaces and belongings which can also be contaminated when people who are infected with an illness cough or sneeze near them or if they touch them, the next person to touch that surface may then become infected</li>
</ul>

<p>Staying at home until you feel better reduces the risk that you will pass on an illness to your friends, colleagues, and others in your community. This will help reduce the burden on our health services.</p>

<h2>Use the NHS COVID-19 app</h2>

<p>Using <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/">the NHS COVID-19 app</a> helps stop the spread of the virus by informing you that you have been in close contact with someone who has since tested positive for COVID-19, even if you do not know each other. You can also use it to check in to venues with an NHS QR code and receive advice if there has been an outbreak. The app is free and easy to use and doing so can help you protect your loved ones and others.</p>

<p>The app also allows people to report symptoms and order coronavirus tests. To help protect yourself and others, <a rel="external" href="https://www.covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">download and use the latest version of the NHS COVID-19 app</a>.</p>

<h2>Limit close contact with other people</h2>

<p>When someone with COVID-19 breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they release particles containing the virus that causes COVID-19. These particles can be breathed in by another person.</p>

<p>You may choose to limit the close contact you have with people you do not usually live with. You may also choose to take a lateral flow test before being in close contact and also encourage those people you are meeting with to do so, which will help to manage periods of risk. This includes close contact in a higher risk environment, or when spending prolonged periods of time with a vulnerable individual.</p>

<p>These are personal choices which can help reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. It is important to consider that others may wish to continue to take a more cautious approach. We should all be considerate of this and provide the opportunity and space for others to reduce close contacts if they wish.</p>

<h2>Wash your hands regularly and cover coughs and sneezes</h2>

<p>Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser regularly throughout the day. Regular hand washing is an effective way to reduce your risk of catching illnesses, including COVID-19.</p>

<p>It is particularly important to wash your hands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose</li>
  <li>before you eat or handle food</li>
  <li>after coming into contact with surfaces touched by many others, such as handles, handrails and light switches</li>
  <li>after coming into contact with shared areas such as kitchens and bathrooms</li>
  <li>when you return home</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. If you do need to touch your face, for example to put on or take off your face covering, wash or sanitise your hands before and after.</p>

<p>Coughing and sneezing increases the number of droplets and aerosols released by a person, the distance they travel and the time they stay in the air. Covering coughs and sneezes will help reduce the spread of particles carrying COVID-19 and other viruses, including those that cause coughs and colds.</p>

<h2>Understanding your personal risk in different settings and scenarios</h2>

<h3>If you were previously identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV)</h3>

<p>Following expert clinical advice and the successful rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine programme, people previously considered to be CEV are not being advised to shield again. If you were previously identified as CEV, you should continue to follow the guidance contained in this page. You should take advice from your health professional on whether additional precautions are right for you.</p>

<h3>If you are pregnant</h3>

<p>If you’re pregnant, your chance of getting COVID-19 is not higher than anyone else and it’s very unlikely you’ll get seriously ill with it.</p>

<p>As a minimum, you should follow the same guidance as everyone else. If you are more than 28 weeks pregnant, or if you are pregnant and have an underlying health condition that puts you at a greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19 at any point in pregnancy, you may want to consider limiting close contact with people you do not normally meet with regularly.</p>

<h3>If you live in an area receiving an enhanced response to COVID-19</h3>

<p>The government will work with local authorities in areas which need an enhanced response to COVID-19 to avoid the NHS facing unsustainable pressure. It is particularly important for people living in these areas to follow the guidance on this page which will help to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to help protect yourself and others. Enhanced Response Areas will also receive additional targeted support, such as surge testing and logistical resources to maximise vaccine uptake, for a 5 week period.</p>

<p>There are currently no areas receiving an enhanced response to COVID-19. This is kept under regular review and this page will be updated if areas are added to this list.</p>

<h2>Travelling in the UK and abroad</h2>

<h3>International travel</h3>

<p>You must follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">rules for international travel</a>.</p>

<h3>Travelling to England from outside the UK</h3>

<p>People planning to travel to England should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control" class="govuk-link">guidance on entering the UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Travelling in the UK, Ireland and Channel Islands</h3>

<p>There are no restrictions on travel within England.</p>

<p>You should check the rules at your destination if you’re planning to travel to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, or to Ireland or the Channel Islands as there may be restrictions in place.</p>

<p>Do not travel if you have COVID-19 symptoms or are self-isolating. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">Get a PCR test</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">follow the stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Businesses and venues</h2>

<p>All businesses should follow the principles set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">working safely guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Employers still have a legal duty to manage risks to those affected by their business. The way to do this is to carry out a health and safety risk assessment, including the risk of COVID-19, and to take reasonable steps to mitigate the risks you identify. The working safely guidance sets out a range of mitigations employers should consider including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying poorly ventilated areas in the venue, for example by using a CO2 monitor, and taking steps to improve air flow in these areas</li>
  <li>ensuring that staff and customers who are unwell do not attend the workplace or venue</li>
  <li>providing hand sanitiser to enable staff and customers to clean their hands more frequently, and cleaning surfaces that people touch regularly</li>
  <li>communicating to staff and customers the measures you have put in place</li>
</ul>

<p>Settings in which face coverings are required must display signage or take other measures to ensure customers are aware of the requirement to wear a face covering on their premises where there is no applicable exemption or reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>Businesses are also encouraged to continue displaying NHS QR codes for attendees wishing to check in using the NHS COVID-19 app so they are alerted if there’s an outbreak and can take action to protect others.</p>
