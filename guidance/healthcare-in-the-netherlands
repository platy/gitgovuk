<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>

<h2 id="brexit-healthcare">Healthcare in the Netherlands after Brexit</h2>

<p>You should prepare for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national living in or visiting the Netherlands.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with the Netherlands in place. For example, if you are a current S1 form holder, or a posted worker or student using a <a href="#ehic">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a> you will not be able to rely on these to access your healthcare.</p>

<h3 id="living-in-the-netherlands-after-brexit">Living in the Netherlands after Brexit</h3>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-netherlands#visas-and-residency">registering to live in the Netherlands</a></li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of the Netherlands</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<p>If you are living in the Netherlands, you must contribute to the statutory health insurance scheme to be entitled to the same healthcare as Dutch nationals. It is a legal requirement for you to have basic statutory health insurance, and you must take this out within 4 months of arriving in the Netherlands.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>

<p>Your S1 certificate may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with the Netherlands and may mean you have to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-the-netherlands-after-brexit">Studying in the Netherlands after Brexit</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with the Netherlands and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in the Netherlands before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment">Get help paying for medical treatment</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free if you are living in the Netherlands and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>You may use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge if you are living in the Netherlands before exit day and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="ehic">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with the Netherlands and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need. If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<p>You must have health insurance if you live or are employed by a company based in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>It is a legal requirement for you to have basic statutory health insurance, and you must take this out within 4 months of arriving in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>If you don’t have basic statutory health insurance, you risk incurring high fines imposed by the Central Administration Office (CAK) and serious financial trouble if in need of medical care.</p>

<p>Most people take out voluntary supplementary insurance to cover healthcare over and above the universal system.</p>

<p>Medical care in the Netherlands is not free of charge. However, the costs of many types of care are reimbursed under the statutory healthcare insurance.</p>

<h3 id="uk-posted-workers">UK posted workers</h3>

<p>If you are a worker posted by a UK company to the Netherlands, you may be entitled to health cover funded by the UK in the country you’re posted to.</p>

<p>You can find out more from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):</p>

<p>The same rules apply for both pensioners and non-pensioners.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in the Netherlands and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>Apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in the Netherlands. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you are a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for an <a rel="external" href="https://contactcentreservices.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/selfnhsukokb/AskUs_EHIC/en-gb/6696/application-forms-and-evidence/16477/s1-form-what-is-this-and-how-do-i-obtain-one">S1 certificate</a> through the Business Services Authority.</p>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit. 
Read about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>If you are a UK resident studying in the Netherlands, your student <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>The government always advises UK nationals to take out comprehensive insurance when going overseas. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not an alternative to insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>If you are under 30 and live in the Netherlands for study purposes only, you cannot enrol with a Dutch health insurer for basic health insurance. You must obtain health insurance from the UK.</p>

<p>If you have a part-time job while completing your studies, you are required to have basic health insurance with a Dutch health insurer. This also applies for internships and volunteering.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The government always advises UK nationals to take out comprehensive travel insurance when going overseas.

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> enables you to access necessary healthcare in the Netherlands. Even with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> you might need to make a contribution to treatment.</p>

<p>If you require emergency hospital treatment, you can use any hospital in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting the Netherlands if you have a pre-existing condition.</p>

<p>You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>The Money and Pensions Advice Service has information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions">buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medicine with you.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>Read the NHS guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">seeking medical treatment in Europe</a> if you are travelling to have planned medical treatment.</p>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>

<p>If you have a serious or life-threatening emergency or you need an ambulance, call 112. This number is free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="dentists">Dentists</h3>

<p>Most emergency departments or health centres have a dentist attached that can deal with dental emergencies. Some of the costs will be covered by a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>

<p>You’ll need to be referred by a doctor for any non-emergency hospital treatment and you will need a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. Both public and private hospitals must accept a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You do not have to provide travel insurance details unless you choose to do so.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>

<p>You will be charged for the cost of the medicine, in addition to a service cost, when collecting prescriptions.</p>

<p>There are handling costs for every prescription, and costs for the counselling conversation with each new medicine. The level of these costs varies per pharmacy, per medicine and per time. Usually the initial rate is about €12, but this amount may vary.</p>

<p>Pensioners will have to declare they receive a UK State Pension to pay a lower contribution.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-own-medicines-to-the-netherlands">Bringing your own medicines to the Netherlands</h2>

<p>Some prescribed medicines contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in the UK. This means that additional legal controls apply to these medicines.</p>

<p>You may need a personal license to take controlled medicines abroad.</p>

<p>Specific requirements also apply to the information that you must take with you and how you carry your controlled medicines.</p>
