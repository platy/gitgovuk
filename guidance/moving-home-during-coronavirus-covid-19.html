<p>This guidance provides advice to those working within the home buying and selling process and those moving home. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">guidance on what you can and cannot do to keep safe</a>.</p>

<p>Although many of the legal restrictions have been lifted, the situation has not yet returned to normal. Guidance remains in place, and caution and restraint are still necessary. While the virus continues to circulate, everybody needs to continue to act carefully and remain cautious. We will continue to manage the virus and provide guidance over the coming months.</p>

<h2>General advice to industry and those moving home</h2>

<p>We urge everyone involved in the home buying and selling process to continue to follow good hygiene practices, including regular hand-washing, sanitising, and cleaning. These measures will help prevent the spread of infection.</p>

<p>You should consider when it may be appropriate to follow additional advisory social distancing measures. Read more on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">how to stop the spread of the virus</a>.</p>

<h3>How businesses can mitigate risk</h3>

<p>All businesses should follow the government’s latest guidance for employers and businesses. Individual sector bodies may issue their own supplementary guidance in order to protect their members and their clients.</p>

<p>Since Step 4 we have seen a gradual return to offices and workplaces. As workers return to their workplaces, employers should continue to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">Working safely guidance</a>.</p>

<p>When considering a return to the workplace, employers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reflect this in their workplace risk assessment</li>
  <li>take action to manage the risk of COVID-19 spreading in line with the guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>While offices are open to the public, businesses should advise customers of any COVID-19 procedures which will remain in place.</p>

<p>Property agents, conveyancers and other professionals may choose to retain some modifications to how they work to reduce the risk from COVID-19. These changes could impact your move and may include initial virtual viewings before in-person viewings, asking you to vacate your current property during viewings, and ensuring your property is thoroughly cleaned before someone else views it or moves in. We would ask that you cooperate with these measures where they are in place.</p>

<h3>Private rented and social housing sectors</h3>

<p>Those renting a property, letting agents and landlords should be aware of and follow the government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities">guidance on coronavirus and renting</a> which contains further advice that may also be applicable such as on possession proceedings, repairs, maintenance and health and safety.</p>

<h2>Self-isolating and quarantine</h2>

<p>If you’re fully vaccinated or under 18 and 6 months, you’re not required to self-isolate if you’ve had close contact with someone with COVID-19.</p>

<p>Find out whether you need to self-isolate and how you can protect others if:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">you live with someone who has or might have COVID-19</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">you’ve been in contact with someone who has or might have COVID-19 but you do not live with them</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Most guidance is now voluntary, but some key general protections remain in place. These apply both to those moving home and those working in the industry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you get any COVID-19 symptoms, self-isolate immediately and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a PCR test</a>. Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">what to do if you have COVID-19</a>.</li>
  <li>You must still self-isolate if you are told to do so by NHS Test and Trace.</li>
  <li>If you are self-isolating, you should not view or work in other people’s homes for the duration of your isolation. Home viewings can continue to take place virtually, if possible.</li>
  <li>There are some legal exceptions which still allow you to leave home. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">guidance for those with possible or confirmed coronavirus infection</a>.</li>
  <li>You must follow the quarantine rules when entering England. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england" class="govuk-link">guidance on entering England</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managing uncertainty</h2>

<p>All parties involved in home buying and selling should prioritise agreeing amicable arrangements to change completion dates where someone in a chain or their family member is self-isolating or has tested positive for coronavirus.</p>

<p>Once you have exchanged contracts or signed a tenancy agreement, you have entered into a legal agreement to purchase or rent the property. We encourage all parties to be as flexible as possible and be prepared to delay moves if necessary; for example if someone involved in the transaction becomes ill with COVID-19 during the moving process, or has to self-isolate.</p>

<p>If you are about to enter into a legally binding contract, you should discuss the possible implications of COVID-19 with your legal professional and consider making contractual provisions or other necessary measures to manage these risks.</p>

<p>You should not expect to immediately be able to move into any home where people have COVID-19 or are self-isolating. There is a greater risk that home moves may need to be delayed if someone in the transaction shows symptoms of COVID-19 or is self-isolating.</p>

<h2>Coming into close contact with other people</h2>

<p>While most legal restrictions on contact with others are no longer in place, we still urge caution and personal responsibility in situations involving physical contact with others.</p>

<h3>Face coverings</h3>

<p>You should wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed areas where you come into contact with people you don’t usually meet. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">guidance on when and how to wear face coverings</a>.</p>

<h3>Viewings</h3>

<p>Aside from self-isolation rules as detailed above, there are no legal limits on the households which may view a home in person. We would, however, continue to recommend that buyers take advantage of any opportunities to view homes remotely before committing to view in person.</p>

<p>It is important that everyone continues to follow the safe hygiene practices as described above, and you should let in fresh air if people are viewing your property.</p>

<h3>Tradespeople in the home</h3>

<p>Tradespeople can continue to work in other people’s homes unless customers or tradespeople are self-isolating, as detailed above.</p>

<p>Members of the public should ensure their homes are clean and safe before tradespeople enter. This may involve cleaning items being carried by removals firms, wiping surfaces such as worktops and door handles, letting fresh air into rooms, and seeking to delay work if either party is showing COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<h2>Going further than this guidance</h2>

<p>The above guidance describes the minimum best practices you should follow to help keep yourself and others safe.</p>

<p>If you want additional measures or reasonable conditions in place for your move, please talk to the appropriate business about how to proceed.</p>

<p>These measures could include, for example, placing a cap on the number of visitors viewing your home at any one time. These measures are at the discretion of the homeowner and we would ask you to accommodate their wishes.</p>

<p>Agents and other industry professionals should ensure their clients are aware of and comply with these additional requirements, where they do not discriminate against protected characteristics.</p>
