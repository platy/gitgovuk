<p>The Children’s Social Care Innovation Programme (<abbr title="children's social care innovation programme">CSCIP</abbr>) was launched in 2014 to test and share effective ways of supporting vulnerable children and young people who need help from children’s social care services. The programme has supported 98 projects through £200 million of investment.</p>

<h2>About the programme</h2>

<p>The programme focused on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improving life chances for children who receive help from the social care system</li>
  <li>encouraging innovation by experimenting and replicating successful new approaches</li>
  <li>creating better incentives for innovation and ways of sharing what works</li>
  <li>creating a strong evidence base</li>
  <li>getting better value across the children’s social care sector</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rounds</h3>

<p>Round 1 took place between 2014 and 2016. Local authorities were asked to submit applications rethinking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children’s social work (improving the quality and impact of children’s social work)</li>
  <li>support for adolescents in, or on the edge of, care (improving the quality and impact of services)</li>
</ul>

<p>Round 2 took place between 2016 and 2020. It looked to build on the successful innovations found in round 1 (known as scale and spread).</p>

<p>Round 3 (the targeted funding opportunity) took place between 2017 and 2020. We asked for applications in 4 policy areas where there was a need to quickly develop and test new approaches. These 4 areas were set out in the Department for Education’s (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) policy paper on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/putting-children-first-our-vision-for-childrens-social-care">putting children first: vision for children’s social care</a>.</p>

<h3>Partners</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funded projects across local authorities and public sector organisations to develop and test innovations that would help children’s social work practitioners and leaders.</p>

<p>There is a <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1061541/Innovation_Programme_Project_Directory_1.xlsx">full list of projects</a> (<span class="type">MS Excel Spreadsheet</span>, <span class="file-size">44.2 KB</span>)</span> that includes name, location, summary and funding amount.</p>

<h3>Partners in Practice</h3>

<p>Some of the local authorities that set up round 1 projects which showed the best impact have gone on to become Partners in Practice. The Partners in Practice programme is running alongside the Children’s Social Care Innovation Programme.</p>

<p>It aims to be a genuine partnership between local and central government by bringing together the best practitioners and leaders in children’s social care to improve the system.</p>

<p>Through the programme the Partners in Practice are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continuing to demonstrate what works and encourage innovation to create understanding of the conditions needed for excellent practice to flourish</li>
  <li>encouraging sector led improvement through peer support to authorities which need to improve</li>
  <li>supporting <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to shape and test policy on wider programmes and reform</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strengthening Families</h3>

<p>The Strengthening Families, Protecting Children programme aims to enable more children to stay at home in stable family environments so that fewer children need to be taken in to care. The programme is investing £84 million over 5 years to improve services in 18 local authorities that have high or rising numbers of children in care.</p>

<p>These local authorities will be supported to embed one of 3 models, which have the most promising evidence from the innovation programme of safely reducing the number of children being taken into care. These models are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Family Valued</li>
  <li>Family Safeguarding</li>
  <li>No Wrong Door</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supporting Families</h3>

<p>The Supporting Families: Investing in Practice programme adds to the learning so far from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s Children’s Social Care Innovation Programme. It has provided over £17 million to enable 45 local authorities to adapt one of 3 of the most successful targeted innovation programme projects. These were projects that have the strongest evidence of successfully keeping families together.</p>

<p>These projects are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>family drug and alcohol courts supported by the Centre for Justice Innovation</li>
  <li>a model of family group conferencing supported by Daybreak</li>
  <li>the Mockingbird family model supported by The Fostering Network</li>
</ul>

<h3>Evaluation approach</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> commissioned independent research organisations to evaluate projects to understand what has and has not worked and why. Rees Centre and University of Oxford co-ordinated the evaluation of round 1 and Opcit Research co-ordinated the evaluation of rounds 2 and 3.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> oversaw this process through the evaluation advisory board. Board members included the chief social worker, representatives from the What Works Centre incubator, as well as senior <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> officials.</p>

<p>The individual project evaluation reports have been grouped by theme on this page. Practitioners and leaders can find examples of best practice and evidence of what has worked.</p>

<p>Overarching evaluations have been published in:</p>
