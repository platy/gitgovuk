<h2>About <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Government established <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> to implement Article 8 (4 to 6) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en" rel="external">EU Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU)</a>. The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1643/contents/made" rel="external"><abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> Regulations 2014</a> give effect to the scheme.</p>

<p><abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> is a mandatory energy assessment scheme for organisations in the UK that meet the qualification criteria. The Environment Agency is the UK scheme administrator.</p>

<p>The UK regulators are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Environment Agency for organisations whose registered office is in England</li>
  <li>Natural Resources Wales for organisations whose registered office is in Wales</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland Environment Agency for organisations whose registered office is in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Scottish Environment Protection Agency for organisations whose registered office is in Scotland</li>
  <li>Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for organisations whose activities consist wholly or mainly of offshore activities</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations that qualify for <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> must carry out <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> assessments every 4 years. These assessments are audits of the energy used by their buildings, industrial processes and transport to identify cost-effective energy saving measures.</p>

<h2>Deadlines for <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> compliance</h2>

<p>Organisations must notify the Environment Agency by a set deadline that they have complied with their <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> obligations. The deadline for the first compliance period was 5 December 2015. The deadline for the second compliance period (<abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> phase 2) was 5 December 2019.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If youâ€™re not sure if you qualified for the last compliance period then contact the Environment Agency at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ESOS@environment-agency.gov.uk">ESOS@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Find out if you qualified for <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> phase 2</h2>

<p><abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> applies to large UK undertakings and their corporate groups. It mainly affects businesses but can also apply to not-for-profit bodies and any other non public sector undertakings that are large enough to meet the qualification criteria.</p>

<p>Your organisation qualified for the second compliance period if, on 31 December 2018, it met the <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> definition of a large undertaking.</p>

<p>Corporate groups qualify if at least one UK group member meets the <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> definition of a large undertaking.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re very close to the qualification threshold or have substantially increased or decreased in size in recent years, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/comply-with-the-energy-savings-opportunity-scheme-esos">full guidance on complying with <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr></a>. This includes additional information on how to assess if you qualify.</p>

<p>Public sector organisations do not usually need to comply with <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr>. For more information on organisations that do not need to comply, see section 1.2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/comply-with-the-energy-savings-opportunity-scheme-esos">full guidance on complying with <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Large undertakings</h3>

<p>For the qualification date for the second compliance period (31 December 2018) a large undertaking is any UK company that either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employed 250 or more people</li>
  <li>had an annual turnover in excess of â‚¬50 million (Â£44,845,000), and an annual balance sheet total in excess of â‚¬43 million (Â£38,566,700)</li>
</ul>

<p>For the qualification date for the third compliance period (31 December 2022) a large undertaking is any UK company that either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employs 250 or more people</li>
  <li>has an annual turnover in excess of Â£44 million, and an annual balance sheet total in excess of Â£38 million</li>
</ul>

<p>For your accounts, you should use the Bank of England exchange rate between the Euro and pound sterling at close of business on the qualification date.</p>

<p>You must take part in <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> if your undertaking is part of a corporate group which includes another UK undertaking or UK establishment which meets these criteria.</p>

<p>Where a corporate group participates in <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr>, unless otherwise agreed, the highest UK parent will act as a â€˜responsible undertakingâ€™ and be responsible for ensuring the group as a whole complies.</p>

<p>UK registered establishments of an overseas company will also need to take part in <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> (regardless of their size) if any other part of their global corporate group activities in the UK meet the <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> qualifying criteria.</p>

<p>An â€˜establishmentâ€™ is a branch within the meaning of the Eleventh Company Law Directive (89/666/EEC), or a place of business that is not such a branch but where there is some degree of physical presence in the UK.</p>

<p>A person is employed by an undertaking if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an employee</li>
  <li>an owner or manager</li>
  <li>a partner</li>
</ul>

<p>An â€˜employeeâ€™ is a person employed under contracts of service. Their contracted hours and status (full time or part time) are irrelevant to their classification as an employee.</p>

<p>The number of employees means the average number of people employed by the undertaking in the year.</p>

<p>To work out your average number of employees, you need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the number of people employed by the company for each month of the financial year (whether for the whole month or part of it).</li>
  <li>Add together the monthly totals.</li>
  <li>Divide the total by the number of months in the financial year.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Complete an <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> assessment</h2>

<p>If you qualify for <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> and your organisation is fully covered by ISO 50001, you do not need to carry out an <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> assessment. You just need to notify the Environment Agency that youâ€™re compliant with <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you qualify for <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr>, but your organisation is not fully covered by ISO 50001, you need to carry out an <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> assessment. The assessment helps you work out what your organisation needs to do to comply with the <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> regulations.</p>

<p>The assessment takes into account energy directly covered by Display Energy Certificates (<abbr title="Display Energy Certificates">DECs</abbr>), Green Deal Assessments (<abbr title="Green Deal Assessments">GDAs</abbr>), or ISO 50001.</p>

<p>For your assessment, you need to:</p>

<h3>1. Calculate your total energy consumption</h3>

<p>This is the energy used by assets held or activities carried out by your organisation or group. This includes the energy consumed by buildings, industrial processes and transport. To find out how to calculate your total energy consumption, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/comply-with-the-energy-savings-opportunity-scheme-esos">full guidance on complying with <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>2. Identify your areas of significant energy consumption</h3>

<p>This is the energy used by assets held, or activities carried out, by your organisation that account for at least 90% of your total energy consumption. You then need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Find out whether ISO 50001, <abbr title="Display Energy Certificates">DECs</abbr> or <abbr title="Green Deal Assessments">GDAs</abbr> cover any of your areas of significant energy consumption.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify whether <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> compliant energy audits have been, or need to be, carried out for the areas of significant energy consumption not covered by ISO 50001, <abbr title="Display Energy Certificates">DECs</abbr> or <abbr title="Green Deal Assessments">GDAs</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As long as 90% of your total energy consumption is covered, you can use a mix of approaches with some of your energy consumption covered by ISO 50001 â€“ some by <abbr title="Display Energy Certificates">DECs</abbr> or <abbr title="Green Deal Assessments">GDAs</abbr> and some by <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> energy audits.</p>

<h3>3. Appoint a lead assessor</h3>

<p>You need to appoint a lead assessor to carry out and oversee or review your energy audits and overall <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> assessment. Lead assessors can be employees or external contractors as long as they are members of an <a class="govuk-link" href="#approved">approved professional body register</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to become a lead assessor you have to be (or become) a member of an <a class="govuk-link" href="#approved">approved professional body register</a>. Individuals cannot apply directly to the Environment Agency to be approved.</p>

<p>Professional bodies can submit registers of their members for approval for them to act as <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> lead assessors.</p>

<h3>4. Notify the Environment Agency</h3>

<p>You need to <a class="govuk-link" href="#Compliance">submit your <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> notification of compliance to the Environment Agency</a> when you have undertaken an <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> assessment and are compliant with your obligations. Use the online notification system to do this.</p>

<p>You do not need to log in to the system or create an account to submit your notification details. There is no charge for submitting your <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> notification.</p>

<p>You can start your notification whenever youâ€™re ready. You can also partially complete your notification and save it for submitting later. The system will send you an email with a link to use to resume. Do not lose this email otherwise youâ€™ll have to start again. As long as you have the email the saved information will not disappear or expire. You can return to it at any time.</p>

<h3>5. Keep records</h3>

<p>You need to keep records of how you have complied with <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> in an evidence pack. There is no set format for this.</p>

<h2>Submit your <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> notification of compliance</h2>

<p>When you have completed your <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> submission you must submit a notification of compliance using the online system.</p>

<p>The notification includes details about your organisation and how it has complied. You do not need to provide energy data.</p>

<p>When you access the notification system you will be redirected away from GOV.UK to complete your notification. When you have submitted your notification you will be redirected back to this web page.</p>

<p>Your submission must be as accurate as possible. If the information you submitted is inaccurate, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:esos@environment-agency.gov.uk">esos@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>, quoting the original submission date, the Companies House registration number (if applicable) and the name of the organisation for which you made the notification.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/0YNAR/" rel="external">Submit your notification of compliance</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you do not qualify for <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> phase 2</h2>

<p>If you have been contacted by the Environment Agency in the past, or you qualified for the first compliance period but not for phase 2, you need to tell the Environment Agency you do not qualify. Do this using the online notification system and selecting the option â€˜Do not qualifyâ€™. This is all you need to do.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> compliant energy audits</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> compliant energy audit must meet these criteria:</p>

<h3>1. It must be based on 12 monthsâ€™ verifiable data</h3>

<p>The data must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be for a continuous period</li>
  <li>begin no earlier than 6 December 2014 for the second compliance period (and no more than 12 months before the start of future compliance periods)</li>
  <li>begin no more than 24 months before the start of the energy audit</li>
  <li>not have been used as the basis for an energy audit in a previous compliance period</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. It must analyse the participantâ€™s energy consumption and energy efficiency</h3>

<p>This must be done where practical using energy consumption profiling. Energy consumption profiling involves breaking down the different ways in which energy is used by a participantâ€™s activities and assets and analysing any variations in energy use to identify inefficiencies.</p>

<h3>3. It must identify energy saving opportunities</h3>

<p>Energy saving opportunities should be reasonably practicable and cost effective to implement. Recommendations should include the estimated costs and benefits of implementation.</p>

<p>You should assess cost effectiveness by comparing the reduction in units of energy or energy spend with the cost of implementing the measure.</p>

<p>Calculating the cost of implementing a measure should be based on an analysis of whether the investment will be economical over its entire life. This would include taking into account the cost of purchase, installation, maintenance and depreciation.</p>

<p>There is no regulatory requirement for participants to implement the energy saving opportunities identified. This is for each organisation to determine themselves.</p>

<h3>Site visits during an audit</h3>

<p>Organisations are expected to carry out site visits as part of their <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> audits. It is not necessary to visit every site. Regardless of the number of site visits, organisations need to ensure they have collected and analysed data for all their areas of significant energy consumption.</p>

<p>Organisations with multiple sites or assets that are identical or very similar, can take a proportionate approach and apply the energy saving opportunities identified in their site visits to their wider portfolio. The lead assessor and participant organisation should determine a suitable site visit sampling approach to reflect the energy consumption patterns of their assets and activities. This is not prescribed in legislation or guidance â€“ it is up to your organisation and lead assessor to agree this.</p>

<p>You need to explain in your evidence pack how the approach you took reflects the energy consumption patterns and saving opportunities for your portfolio of assets and activities. In a compliance audit the regulators will look for well reasoned and documented justifications for the approach you took.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> regulation and penalties</h2>

<p>Your <a class="govuk-link" href="#esos-regulators">environmental regulator</a> is responsible for compliance and enforcement activities. It may issue civil sanctions including financial penalties if an organisation does not meet the schemeâ€™s obligations.</p>

<p>Read the Environment Agencyâ€™s approach to <abbr title="Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme">ESOS</abbr> regulation and penalties in their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-enforcement-and-sanctions-policy">enforcement and sanctions policy (annex 2, section D)</a>.
