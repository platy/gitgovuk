<p>The Government Skills and Curriculum unit currently have three induction programmes for senior Civil Service leaders:</p>

<h2>Civil Service Orientation (CSO)</h2>

<p>CSO is run as a three stage programme. This programme is aimed at externally hired senior civil servants who are new to the Civil Service.  It is designed support participants to begin thinking about the knowledge, skills and networks needed to thrive in their new roles. We are creating a space for new SCS to meet with peers, build networks, draw from the experience of others in a senior role and begin to build their understanding of how the Civil Service works and what it means to be a senior leader in the Civil Service.</p>

<p>The aims of the programme are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>celebrate the new role and welcome participants to the Civil Service;</li>
  <li>provide the participants with a clear steer of what is expected of them as leaders within the Civil Service;</li>
  <li>create personal networks across the Civil Service;</li>
  <li>introduce the Civil Service corporate leadership frameworks;</li>
  <li>provide support to new SCS to think about their leadership journey;</li>
  <li>provide insights into working with ministers and the private office; and</li>
  <li>provide an overview of the financial architecture of the Civil Service.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/learning-events-calendar">Visit the programmes, workshops and events calendar to book a place</a>.</p>

<p>We also recommend that SCS leaders that are new to the Civil Service attend parliamentary workshops which are run by the Parliamentary Capability team:</p>

<h3>Working with Parliament for leaders</h3>
<p>The Parliamentary Capability Team is based in the Government Skills and Curriculum Unit, and exists to help civil servants better understand how Parliament scrutinises the work of government and how they can effectively support their department’s response to Parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p>The team have created three bespoke learning events aimed at SCS:</p>

<h4>Leading and Parliament</h4>
<p>An introduction to Parliament specifically designed for senior leaders delivered remotely over two weeks in conjunction with the Civil Service Leadership Academy. You will gain a better understanding of your role in supporting ministers with their parliamentary duties, hearing from high profile parliamentarians, senior parliamentary officials, and civil servants with considerable experience of parliamentary work. If you would like to know more about this course, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:parliamentarycapability@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">parliamentarycapability@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a></p>

<h4>Select Committees for Leaders</h4>
<p>This will give SCS an understanding of how to effectively manage the work of parliamentary select committees that scrutinize their department’s work. It will cover parliamentary process and culture, supporting ministers with committee appearances, and the internal activities that need to be managed in order to effectively respond to this work. If you would like to know more about this course, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:parliamentarycapability@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">parliamentarycapability@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a></p>

<h4>Accounting Officers Roundtable</h4>
<p>This course is designed for newly appointed Accounting Officers or Additional Accounting Officers. It will help you understand your responsibilities for the use of public money, and preparing for appearances before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in Parliament. The workshop includes guest speakers from HM Treasury and the National Audit Office, alongside opportunities to exchange knowledge with fellow delegates. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/learning-events-calendar">Visit the CSLA programmes, workshops and events calendar to find out available dates</a>.</p>

<h2>Deputy Director Induction (DDI)</h2>

<p>DDI is run as a three stage programme. This programme is aimed at deputy directors who have been recently promoted or have completed the Civil Service orientation. It is designed support participants to transition into their new roles by providing them with the knowledge, skills and networks they need to be successful. We are creating a space for participants to meet with peers, build networks, gain essential knowledge and draw from the experience of others in a senior role.</p>

<p>The aims of the programme are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>welcome participants to the Senior Civil Service and celebrate their new role;</li>
  <li>provide the participants with a clear expectation of what is expected of them as deputy directors;</li>
  <li>provide essential knowledge to support in their first 100 days;</li>
  <li>provide current and relevant insights into the operation of Government;</li>
  <li>create personal networks across the Civil Service; and</li>
  <li>provide support to new SCS to think about their leadership journey.</li>
</ul>
