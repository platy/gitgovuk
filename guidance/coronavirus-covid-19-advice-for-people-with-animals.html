<p>On 4 January the Prime Minister announced a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national lockdown</a> for all of England.</p>
</div>

<p>If you, or a member of your household, have symptoms of coronavirus you should self-isolate for 10 days.</p>

<p>If you’re self-isolating you should make alternative arrangements to take care of your animal’s welfare. You should ask for support from others who are not self-isolating or use professional services.</p>

<h2>Animals with coronavirus</h2>

<p>It is rare for an animal to contract coronavirus, and they may show only mild clinical signs and recover within a few days.</p>

<p>Limited evidence available at present suggests that coronavirus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>may pass from infected humans to certain pets such as dogs, cats and ferrets following close contact</li>
  <li>does not easily pass between cats or most other pets, but this cannot be ruled out</li>
  <li>may pass between ferrets and humans based on the evidence from mink infections</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pets</h3>

<p>In line with public health guidance, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash your hands before and after any contact with your pet,  its food and bedding</li>
  <li>not share food with your pet</li>
  <li>avoid contact such as kissing or cuddling if you’re self-isolating</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no evidence that you need to wash your pets to control the spread of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Only wash or use products on your pets that are approved for use on animals.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about your pet because it has respiratory or digestive problems and a temperature you should contact your vet who will decide whether testing is required.</p>

<h3>If you own a ferret</h3>

<p>You should isolate your ferret for 21 days if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you or your household are self-isolating</li>
  <li>you’ve brought your ferret to England from a country not on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors">travel corridor list</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Isolation means avoiding contact between your ferret and either ferrets or people from other households.</p>

<p>If your ferret needs emergency veterinary care while you’re self-isolating, you can arrange to have it taken to the vet, or take it to the vet yourself where necessary. You should tell the vet in advance that you’re self-isolating.</p>

<h2>Animal boarding services</h2>

<p>You may leave your home to access animal boarding services.</p>

<p>You should take your pet to, or collect your pet from, a boarding establishment by appointment only. Ask your animal boarding service if they provide a collection or drop-off service.</p>

<h2>Grooming</h2>

<p>You may leave your home to take your pet to be groomed. You should do this only if necessary for your animal’s welfare and not simply for aesthetic purposes.</p>

<p>You should contact the groomer in advance to make an appointment. Ask the groomer if they operate a mobile service or provide a collection and drop-off service.</p>

<h2>Buying or adopting a pet</h2>

<p>You must follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">social distancing rules</a> when buying or adopting a pet.</p>

<p>You should not visit a breeder or rescue centre in person to view an animal before buying or adopting it. This is not a reasonable excuse to leave your home.</p>

<p>You should ask for a virtual tour instead. Take extra care to make sure that the seller is legitimate by following <a rel="external" href="https://getyourpetsafely.campaign.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">government guidance on how to get pets responsibly</a></p>

<p>Breeders and rescue centres should make arrangements to deliver your pet to you when it is ready to be rehomed. Where this is not possible, and it is reasonably necessary for the pet’s welfare, you may collect the animal. You should collect your pet by appointment only.</p>

<p>You must collect the pet without entering the premises where this is a private home.</p>

<h2>If your animal needs vet treatment</h2>

<p>You can leave home for animal welfare reasons, such as to attend veterinary services for advice or treatment. If your animal needs vet treatment, phone first to arrange the best way to meet their needs.</p>

<p>You may also leave your home to access urgent veterinary services when you’re self-isolating. You should only do this if it is not possible for another person to take the animal to the vet.</p>

<h2>Dog walking</h2>

<p>You may leave your house to walk your dog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by yourself</li>
  <li>with the people you live with</li>
  <li>with your support bubble (if you’re legally permitted to form one)</li>
  <li>or, when on your own in a public outdoor space, with one person from another household</li>
</ul>

<p>This is covered by the exemptions for animal welfare and exercise.</p>

<p>Although the government generally advises you should exercise once a day, you can go out more often if you need to walk your dog but should limit this where possible.</p>

<p>You should stay 2 metres apart from anyone outside of your household or support bubble.</p>

<p>When walking your dog in areas used by other people, you should consider putting your dog on a lead to ensure you can stay 2 metres away from others.</p>

<p>You should wash your hands before and after handling your dog.</p>

<h3>If you’re walking dogs on behalf of someone not able to</h3>

<p>You may walk a dog for someone who is unable to leave their house because they are self-isolating.</p>

<p>You should wash your hands before and after handling the dog and keep 2 metres away from other people and animals, including when handing over the dog to the owner.</p>

<h3>If you’re self-isolating</h3>

<p>If your dog cannot be exercised at home, you should ask someone outside of your household or support bubble to walk your dog for you, or access walking services provided by a professional.</p>

<p>You should notify anyone walking your dog on your behalf in advance that you’re self-isolating and arrange a no-contact service where possible.</p>

<h2>Horses, livestock and other animals</h2>

<p>You may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leave your house to visit and provide care for your horse or livestock - that includes where you keep your animal in livery or on private land</li>
  <li>ride your horse or walk your animals to maintain their health and welfare</li>
</ul>

<p>This is covered by the exemptions for animal welfare and exercise.</p>

<p>At sites where this activity is permissible, you may ride your horse or walk your animals to maintain their health and welfare in a public outdoor place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by yourself</li>
  <li>with the people you live with</li>
  <li>with your support bubble (if you’re legally permitted to form one)</li>
  <li>or, when on your own in a public outdoor place, with one person from another household</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the government generally advises you should exercise once a day, you can go out more often if you need to ride your horse or walk your animals but should limit this where possible.</p>

<p>You must follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing rules</a> set out in national guidelines. You should stay 2 metres away from others.</p>

<p>You should wash your hands before and after contact with any animals.</p>

<p>You should make a plan for the care of your horse or livestock in case you need to self-isolate.</p>

<h3>If you’re self-isolating</h3>

<p>If you’re unable to care for your horse or livestock either because you’re unwell or because the animal is not kept at your home you should arrange for someone else who is not self-isolating to care for your animals. If there is no one to help you should contact your yard manager, a vet or your local authority.</p>

<p>You should notify anyone caring for your animals on your behalf in advance that you’re self-isolating and arrange a no-contact service where possible.</p>

<p>This advice also applies to private animal keepers and farm businesses.</p>

<h3>If your horse needs attention from a farrier</h3>

<p>A farrier may visit the premises at which you keep your horse, including where this is your private premises, when this is reasonably necessary for their work. If your horse requires attention from a farrier, you should phone the farrier for advice to best meet your horse’s needs.</p>

<p>You and the farrier should stay 2 metres apart and wash your hands before and after contact with the horse.</p>
