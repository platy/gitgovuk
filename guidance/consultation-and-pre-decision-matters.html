<h2>What local planning authority consultation takes place before a planning application is decided, and with who?</h2>

<p>After a local planning authority has received a planning application, it will undertake a period of consultation where views on the proposed development can be expressed. The formal consultation period will normally last for 21 days, and the local planning authority will identify and consult a number of different groups. There are modifications to the period for representations in respect of applications for public service infrastructure development made on or after 1 August 2021. (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#infrastructure">paragraph 53</a> for the meaning of public service infrastructure development).</p>

<p>The main types of local planning authority consultation are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#Public-consultation">Public consultation</a> – including consultation with neighbouring residents and community groups.</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#Statutory-consultees">Statutory consultees</a> – where there is a requirement set out in law to consult a specific body.</li>
  <li>Any consultation required by a <a class="govuk-link" href="#consultation-and-safeguarding-directions">direction</a> – where there are further,  specific, statutory consultation requirements as set out in a consultation direction.</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#Non-statutory-consultees">Non statutory consultees</a> where there are planning policy reasons to engage other consultees who – whilst not designated in law – are likely to have an interest in a proposed development.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the initial period of consultation, it may be that further additional consultation on <a class="govuk-link" href="#Re-consultation-after-amended">changes submitted by an applicant, prior to any decision being made</a>, is considered necessary.</p>

<p>Finally, once consultation has concluded, the local planning authority will consider the representations made by consultees, and proceed to decide the application. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#consultees-in-decision-making">more information</a> on the role that consultees’ views play in making a decision.</p>

<p>Local planning authority consultation does not remove or affect the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-an-application#Ownership-Certificate-and-Agricultural-Land-Declaration">requirement for the applicant to complete and submit an ownership certificate and agricultural land declaration with an application for planning permission</a>.</p>

<h2>Public consultation</h2>

<h3>What steps must the local planning authority take to involve members of the public on planning applications?</h3>
<p>Local planning authorities are required to undertake a formal period of public consultation, prior to deciding a planning application. This is prescribed in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/595/article/15/made" rel="external">article 15 of the Development Management Procedure Order</a> (as amended). There are separate arrangements for applications for permission in principle which are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1309/article/4/made" rel="external">Article 5G of the Town and Country Planning (Permission in Principle) Order 2017</a> (as amended); for listed buildings which are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1990/1519/regulation/5/made" rel="external">regulation 5</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/2210/regulation/2/made" rel="external">regulation 5A of the Listed Buildings and Conservation Area Regulations 1990</a> (as amended) and for applications for prior approval for development which is subject to permitted development rights which are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/596/schedule/2/made" rel="external">Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015</a> (as amended).</p>

<p>Paragraph: 002 Reference ID: 15-002-20180615</p>

<p>Revision date: 15 06 2018 <a class="govuk-link" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180411211406/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Public-consultation" rel="external">See previous version</a></p>

<h3>Who is eligible to respond to a consultation?</h3>
<p>Anyone can respond to a planning consultation. In addition to individuals who might be directly affected by a planning application, community groups and specific interest groups (national as well as local in some cases) may wish to provide representations on planning applications.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 003 Reference ID: 15-003-20140306</p>

<p>Revision date: 06 03 2014</p>

<h3>What publicity will take place to let the public know that a planning application has been submitted?</h3>
<p>Local planning authorities have discretion about how they inform communities and other interested parties about planning applications. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/595/article/15/made" rel="external">Article 15 of the Development Management Procedure Order</a> sets out minimum statutory requirements for applications for planning permission. These are summarised in <a class="govuk-link" href="#statutory-publicity-requirements">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, local authorities may set out more detail on how they will consult the community on planning applications in their Statement of Community Involvement, prepared under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/5/section/18" rel="external">section 18 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004</a>. See also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plan-making">guidance on plan-making</a>.</p>

<p>Publishing information online in an open data format can help facilitate engagement with the public on planning applications.</p>

<p>Revision date: 23 07 2019 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20190606211054/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Public-consultation" rel="external">See previous version</a></p>

<h3>What is the time period for making comments?</h3>
<p>The time period for making comments will be set out in the publicity accompanying the planning application. This will be not less than 21 days, (18-days in the case of an application for public service infrastructure development made on or after 1 August 2021) or 14 days where a notice is published in a newspaper.</p>

<p>To ensure comments are taken into account it is important to make comments before the statutory deadline.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 005 Reference ID: 15-005-20140306</p>

<p>Revision date: 24 06 2021 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20210615171927/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Public-consultation" rel="external">See previous version</a></p>

<h2>Will the local planning authority take into account views received after the formal period for comments has closed?</h2>

<p>Local planning authorities may, at their discretion, take into account comments that are made after the closing date (but have no obligation to do so).</p>

<p>Paragraph: 034 Reference ID: 15-034-20190723</p>

<p>Revision date 23 07 2019</p>

<h3>When must local planning authorities add additional days to consultation periods because of public holidays?</h3>
<p>In prescribed circumstances local planning authorities must extend periods of public consultation by one day for each public holiday that occurs during the public consultation period.</p>

<p>In this context ‘public holiday’ means Christmas Day, Good Friday, or a day which is a bank holiday in England.</p>

<p>Local planning authorities may not determine the application before the public consultation period allowed for representations to be made has expired.</p>

<p>The circumstances where local planning authorities must add an additional day for each public holiday which occurs during the public consultation period are set out in the table below.</p>

<p>However local planning authorities retain discretion to extend consultation periods where they consider it appropriate. This includes being able to add additional days when public holidays occur in circumstances that are not listed in the table.</p>

<h3>What happens where an application is on land falling within two (or more) local authorities?</h3>
<p>Where an application straddles the boundaries of two or more local planning authorities, publicity should be undertaken separately in each local planning authority area. The authorities will need to agree between themselves whether publicity beyond the statutory minimum in each area is appropriate.</p>

<h3>Will a parish council or a Neighbourhood Forum be informed of planning applications in their area?</h3>

<p>The circumstances in which local planning authorities must notify a parish council or a Neighbourhood Forum are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/schedule/1/paragraph/8" rel="external">Schedule 1, paragraph 8, of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/595/article/25/made" rel="external">article 25 and 25A of the Development Management Procedure Order</a></p>

<p>Where a parish council or Neighbourhood Forum is notified of a planning application, they must make any representations within 21 days. In the case of applications for public service infrastructure development made on or after 1st August 2021 the period is 18 days.</p>

<h3>How can delays in the statutory consultation phase be avoided?</h3>

<p>Early and timely engagement between developers, statutory consultees and local authorities at the pre-application phase is important in helping to address issues and opportunities early on and avoid delays occurring at the formal application stage.</p>

<p>Statutory consultees need to provide clear, positive and transparent information to both local planning authorities and applicants about the information they require to provide a response to consultations. It is important for local planning authorities to work closely with statutory consultees in preparing their local lists of information requirements.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 013 Reference ID: 15-013-20190722</p>

<p>Revision date: 23 07 2019 See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20190606211054/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Statutory-consultees" rel="external">previous version</a></p>

<h3>Can statutory consultees charge for pre application advice?</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances some statutory consultees may be able to charge a fee for their advice at the pre-application stage. Statutory consultees should be guided by their own legal advisers on their powers to charge.</p>

<p>To ensure transparency, where a statutory consultee has the power to charge for pre-application services, it is important to provide information online about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the scale of charges for pre-application services applicable to different types of application (minor/major and other);</li>
  <li>the level of service that will be provided for the charge, including:</li>
  <li>the scope of work and what is included (eg duration and number of meetings or site visits);</li>
  <li>the amount of officer time;</li>
  <li>the outputs (eg a letter or report); and</li>
  <li>the guaranteed response times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Statutory consultees should not charge for a pre-application request to advise on the likely scope of information necessary to enable them to provide a substantive response to the local planning authority at application stage. It is good practice to respond to such requests within no more than 21 days.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 014 Reference ID: 15-014-20190722</p>

<p>Revision date: 23 07 2019 See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20190606211054/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Statutory-consultees" rel="external">previous version</a></p>

<h3>What should local planning authorities expect from a statutory consultee in terms of a response?</h3>

<p>When consulted in the circumstances set out in Article 22 of the Development Management Procedure Order, consultees are under a duty to provide a “substantive response” (as defined in that Article).   Local planning authorities must provide such consultees with the information that will enable them to provide a substantive response.</p>

<p>The substantive response will need to include reasons for the consultee’s views so that where these views have informed a subsequent decision made by a local planning authority the decision is transparent. A holding reply would not be acceptable as a substantive response.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 015 Reference ID: 15-015-20190722</p>

<p>Revision date: 23 07 2019 See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20190606211054/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Statutory-consultees" rel="external">previous version</a></p>

<h3>How long do statutory consultees have to respond to a consultation?</h3>

<p>Where a “substantive response” is required, statutory consultees must provide it –</p>

<p>a) within the period of 21 days beginning with the day on which - 
  (i) the document on which the views of consultees are sought, or
  (ii) where there are several documents and they are sent on different days, the day on which the last of those documents is received. In the case of applications for public service infrastructure development made on or after 1st August 2021 the period is 18 days;  or</p>

<p>b) such other period as may be agreed in writing between the consultee and consultor.</p>

<h3>What happens where a statutory consultee considers that it does not have the information it needs to provide a substantive response?</h3>

<p>It is important for statutory consultees to inform the local planning authority without delay if they require additional information, and that they have procedures in place to enable this to occur as soon as possible after they receive a consultation. It is not acceptable for a statutory consultee to wait until the 21-day period (or 18-days in the case of an application for public service infrastructure development made on or after 1 August 2021) would otherwise have come to a close to notify the local planning authority that it believes it does not have enough information to provide a substantive response.</p>

<p>Where a statutory consultee requests additional information it will need to set out clearly and precisely what the additional information is and the reasons why it is required.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 012 Reference ID: 15-012-20190722</p>

<p>Revision date: 24 06 2021 See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20210615171927/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Statutory-consultees" rel="external">previous version</a></p>

<h3>What happens where a statutory consultee is unable to meet the deadlines for responding?</h3>

<p>Local planning authorities are expected to determine applications for planning permission, within a time period of 5, 8, 10, 13 or 16 weeks (depending on the type of development). Statutory consultees should be aware of the risk that, should they fail to respond within a specified time period, a local planning authority may proceed to decide the application in the absence of their advice.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 016 Reference ID: 15-016-20190722</p>

<p>Revision date: 23 07 2019 See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20190606211054/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Statutory-consultees" rel="external">previous version</a></p>

<h3>Is it possible for the statutory consultee to negotiate an extension to the deadline for representations?</h3>

<p>It is important for statutory consultees to do all they can to meet the deadline for representations.  It should not usually be necessary for an extension to be proposed.</p>

<p>Extensions of time which are negotiated between the statutory consultee and the local planning authority will not affect the applicant’s right to appeal against non-determination. In considering whether to agree to any proposed extension, local planning authorities will therefore need to consider the views of the applicant and the likely impact on the overall time taken to reach a decision.</p>

<h3>Are statutory consultees accountable for their performance as a consultee on planning applications?</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/595/article/23/made" rel="external">Article 23 of the Development Management Procedure Order</a> provides that statutory consultees who are under a duty to provide a substantive response must provide an annual report on their performance in providing such responses within the 18 or 21 day period or longer agreed period, and a summary of the reasons why they failed to comply with the duty to respond within the relevant timescale. The 18-day period will apply to applications for public service infrastructure development made on or after 1 August 2021.</p>

<p>The reports need to be sent to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government each year. Statutory consultees are encouraged to publish the reports on their websites.</p>

<p>Revision date: 06 03 2014</p>

<h2>Safeguarding directions</h2>

<h3>What are safeguarding directions?</h3>

<p>The Development Management Procedure Order includes powers for the Secretary of State to direct local planning authorities that additional consultation must take place in specific local circumstances. This process is referred to as a ‘consultation direction’.</p>

<p>A consultation direction may be issued in relation to areas, sites and routes which are typically of more than local importance, or to allow the further consideration of proposals in the vicinity of existing facilities (such as airports).</p>

<p>Safeguarding directions are a specific type of consultation direction, and typically set out detailed maps of areas (for example, those around some existing facilities, such as certain airports or in relation to proposed infrastructure) where statutory consultation is required on planning applications within their area. Further detailed guidance on safeguarding aerodromes, technical sites and military explosives storage areas is provided in: ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-aerodromes-technical-sites-and-military-explosives-storage-areas/the-town-and-country-planning-safeguarded-aerodromes-technical-sites-and-military-explosives-storage-areas-direction-2002">The Town and Country Planning (Safeguarded Aerodromes, Technical Sites and Military Explosives Storage Areas) Direction 2002</a>’. Detailed guidance on mineral’s safeguarding is provided in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/minerals">Minerals guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Information on meteorological technical sites, and who to consult where a proposed development may affect such a site, can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/services/industry/energy/planning-direction-2014-england.pdf" rel="external">Town and Country Planning (Safeguarding Meteorological Sites) (England) Direction 2014</a></p>

<h3>Where is information kept regarding consultation directions?</h3>

<p>The relevant local planning authority will be able to advise applicants of any consultation directions that might affect planning proposals within its area.</p>

<h3>When does the Secretary of State need to be consulted?</h3>

<p>For certain types of development, local planning authorities are required to consult the Secretary of State before granting planning permission.</p>

<p>The circumstances where this is required are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-town-and-country-planning-consultation-england-direction-2021">Town and Country Planning (Consultation) (England) Direction 2021</a>; the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/745435/180223__TC_Planning_Development_on_the_Trunk_Road_Direction.pdf" rel="external">Town and Country Planning (Development Affecting Trunk Roads) Direction 2018</a>; and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-aerodromes-technical-sites-and-military-explosives-storage-areas">Town and Country Planning (safeguarded aerodromes, technical sites and military explosives storage areas) Direction 2002</a></p>

<p>Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 15-028-20140306
Revision date: 06 03 2014</p>

<h3>What happens if a local planning authority would like to give planning permission against the Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) competent authority advice?</h3>

<p>Where a local planning authority is minded to grant planning permission against the COMAH competent authority’s advice, it should give the Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency or Office for Nuclear Regulation advance notice of that intention, and allow 21 days from that notice for the COMAH competent authority to give further consideration to the matter. This will enable the COMAH competent authority to consider whether to request the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government call-in the application. The Secretary of State exercises the power to call-in applications very selectively.</p>

<p>Revision date: 23 07 2019 See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20190606211054/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Re-consultation-after-amended" rel="external">previous version</a></p>

<h2>Non-statutory consultees</h2>

<h3>What other organisations will  local planning authorities engage with as part of the planning application process?</h3>

<p>In addition to the statutory consultees set out in table 2 below, local planning authorities will  need to consider whether there are planning policy reasons to engage other consultees who – whilst not designated in law – are likely to have an interest in a proposed development (non-statutory consultees). An example of this is the Battlefield Trust in relation to any proposed development that may impact on a historical battlefield site.</p>

<p>To help applicants develop their proposals, local planning authorities are encouraged to produce and publish a locally specific list of non-statutory consultees.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 022 Reference ID: 15-022-20140306</p>

<h3>How can  local planning authorities engage with non-statutory consultees?</h3>

<p>Local planning authorities need to identify the particular types of development or areas in which non-statutory consultees have an interest, so that any consultation can be directed appropriately, and unnecessary consultation avoided.</p>

<p>To ensure consultations are received promptly it is helpful to for applicants and local planning authorities to agree the most cost and time effective system of notification on individual applications.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 023 Reference ID: 15-023-20140306</p>

<p>Revision date: 06 03 2014</p>

<h3>How long do non-statutory consultees have to respond to a planning application?</h3>

<p>Non-statutory consultees are expected to respond within the period specified by the local planning authority. Where, exceptionally, additional time is required it is important to notify the local planning authority as soon as possible. It will be for the local planning authority to decide if further time is allowed. Extensions of time which are negotiated between non-statutory consultees and the local planning authority will not affect the applicant’s right to appeal against non-determination. In considering whether to agree an extension to specified deadline, local authorities will therefore need to consider the views of the applicant, and the likely impact on the overall time taken to reach a decision.</p>

<h2>Re-consultation after an application has been amended</h2>

<h3>Can an application be amended after it has been submitted?</h3>

<p>Paragraph deleted.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 025 Reference ID: 15-025-20190722</p>

<p>Revision date: 23 07 2019 See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20190606211054/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Re-consultation-after-amended" rel="external">previous version</a></p>

<h3>Will further consultation take place after an application is amended?</h3>

<p>An application can be amended after it has been submitted. Guidance on the procedures involved in doing so is set out in ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-an-application">making an application</a>’.</p>

<p>Where an application has been amended it is up to the local planning authority to decide whether further publicity and consultation is necessary in the interests of fairness. In deciding what further steps may be required local planning authorities should consider whether, without re-consultation, any of those who were entitled to be consulted on the application would be deprived of the opportunity to make any representations that they may have wanted to make on the application as amended.</p>

<p>Where the local planning authority decides that it is necessary to re-consult a body which is under a duty to provide a substantive response the timescales in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para011">paragraph 011</a> will apply.</p>

<h2>Is it possible for a statutory or non-statutory consultee to direct refusal of a planning application?</h2>

<p>A statutory or non-statutory consultee may recommend that a planning application be refused but cannot in most cases direct that this happens.</p>

<p>However, the effect of the Town and Country Planning (Development Affecting Trunk Roads) Direction 2018 is that if Highways England, having been consulted on a planning application under Schedule 4 of the Development Management Order 2015, makes a recommendation which the local planning authority does not intend to follow, the local planning authority must consult the Secretary of State and must determine the application in accordance with any Direction given within 21 days by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>In addition, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/580/article/6/made" rel="external">article 6 of the Town and Country Planning (Mayor of London) Order 2008</a> sets out a power for the Mayor of London to direct refusal of a planning application in certain instances. Several combined authorities also have similar powers.</p>

<h3>Can a local planning authority impose a pre-commencement planning condition required by a statutory consultee without the agreement of the applicant?</h3>

<p>The written agreement of the applicant is required for all pre-commencement conditions, except in the circumstances set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/566/made" rel="external">Town and Country Planning (Pre-commencement Conditions) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that an applicant refuses to accept a necessary pre-commencement condition proposed by a local planning authority, the authority can refuse planning permission. This will maintain appropriate protections for important matters such as heritage, the natural environment, green spaces, and measures to mitigate the risk of flooding.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 031 Reference ID: 15-031-20190722</p>

<p>Revision date: 23 07 2019 See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20190606211054/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#table-3-Non-statutory-consultees" rel="external">previous version</a></p>

<h3>Why were temporary publicity and physical inspection requirements for planning applications introduced?</h3>

<p>Temporary changes to the publicity and physical inspection requirements for certain planning applications were introduced through the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/505/contents/made" rel="external">Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure, Listed Buildings and Environmental Impact Assessment) (England) (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1398/contents/made" rel="external">Town and Country Planning (Local Planning, Development Management, Listed Buildings etc) (England) Regulations 2020</a> to support timely decision-making, and avoid delays to development as a result of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, while maintaining public participation in the decision-making process.</p>

<p>These temporary changes were intended to give local planning authorities (and in the case of certain applications for EIA development, applicants) greater flexibility in relation to the way they publicise the planning applications if they were not able to comply with a particular requirement because it was not reasonably practicable to do so for reasons connected to the effects of coronavirus, including restrictions on movement.</p>

<p>Paragraph: 035 Reference ID: 15-035-20201204</p>

<p>Revision date 04 12 2020  See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20201123164425/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#covid19" rel="external">previous version</a></p>

<h3>Which types of planning applications did the temporary changes apply to?</h3>

<p>The temporary changes applied to the following types of application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applications for planning permission made to local planning authorities (including an application for EIA development accompanied by an environmental statement)</li>
  <li>applications for listed building consent</li>
  <li>applications for variation or discharge of conditions attached to listed building consent</li>
  <li>applications for planning permission affecting the setting of a listed building or the character or appearance of a conservation area made to local planning authorities</li>
  <li>applications made by local planning authorities to the Secretary of State for listed building consent for the demolition, alteration or extension of a listed building</li>
  <li>applications for planning permission or a subsequent application for EIA development which has been made without an environmental statement, where the applicant proposes to submit such a statement</li>
  <li>submission of further information to supplement an environmental statement</li>
</ul>

<p>Paragraph: 036 Reference ID: 15-036-20200513</p>

<p>Revision date 13 05 2020</p>

<h3>When did the changes expire?</h3>

<p>The temporary changes in relation to the publicity requirements described below expired on 30 June 2021:</p>

<p>The temporary changes relating to the requirements to provide a physical address where documents may be inspected or copies obtained (as the case may be) expire on 31 December 2021.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a local planning authority making available for physical inspection their Planning Register which contains applications for planning permission at their principal office or an office in the relevant area</li>
  <li>a local planning authority making applications for listed building consent, for variation or discharge of conditions, for planning permission affecting the setting of a listed building etc or applications they make to the Secretary of State available for inspection at a physical address in the locality</li>
  <li>applicants submitting an environmental statement for EIA development making a reasonable number of copies available at an address in the locality, named in notices.</li>
  <li>the recipient of further information and evidence relating to an environmental statement also making copies of that information available at a physical address, named in notices.</li>
</ul>

<p>The expiry provisions were subject to savings provisions. If a publicity exercise starts before the expiry of the physical address changes and a notice does not name a physical address, that notice remains valid for the purpose of the publicity exercise.</p>
