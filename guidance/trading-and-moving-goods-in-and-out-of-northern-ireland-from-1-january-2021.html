<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, there will be no changes in how qualifying Northern Ireland goods move directly from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. There will be some changes for qualifying goods moved indirectly through Ireland.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This qualifying goods regime forms part of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-qualifying-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-the-rest-of-the-uk" class="govuk-link">phased approach to the implementation of ‘unfettered access’</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Bringing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain and from outside the EU</h3>

<p>The Northern Ireland Protocol explains that goods from Great Britain (not deemed to be at risk of leaving the UK customs territory) will not pay any tariffs. However, goods ‘at risk’ of entering the EU’s single market will pay EU tariffs.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you’ll need to make declarations and may need to pay tariffs when bringing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain or from outside the EU.</p>

<p>There are a number of options available to avoid paying tariffs when moving goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Before moving your goods, you should consider which of these options is most suitable for your business.</p>

<p>When bringing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, you’ll pay no duty if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claiming-preferential-rates-of-duty-between-the-uk-and-eu-from-1-january-2021">claim a preferential rate of duty</a> under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and EU</li>
  <li>authorised under the UK Trader Scheme and <a href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-declare-goods-you-bring-into-northern-ireland-not-at-risk-of-moving-to-the-eu-from-1-january-2021#when-goods-are-not-at-risk" class="govuk-link">declare that your goods are not ‘at risk’ of onward movement to the EU</a>
</li>
  <li>eligible to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-waiver-for-duty-on-goods-that-you-bring-to-northern-ireland-from-great-britain">claim a waiver</a> on the duty up to specified limits</li>
</ul>

<p>When bringing goods into Northern Ireland from outside the UK and the EU, you’ll pay the UK duty rate if your goods are not ‘at risk’ of onward movement to the EU.</p>

<h2>Before you move goods</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>If you plan to move goods between Northern Ireland and non-EU countries (including Great Britain), you’ll <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori#if-you-move-goods-to-or-from-northern-ireland">need an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number that starts with XI</a>.</p>

<h2>Making declarations</h2>
