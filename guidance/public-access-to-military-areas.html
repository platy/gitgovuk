<h2>Cape Wrath Training Area</h2>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>Cape Wrath Training Area is located near Durness, in Sutherland at the far northwest corner of the UK Mainland approximately 120 miles from Inverness.</p>

<h3>Site description</h3>

<p>Cape Wrath Training Area provides opportunities for a wide variety of field fire and dry training exercises across 25,000 acres of severe and isolated upland moorland.</p>

<p>It is the only range in Europe where land, sea and air training activities can be conducted simultaneously and where the Royal Air Force can train using live 1,000lb bombs.</p>

<p>The range forms part of an area that is often referred to as “the last great wilderness”, due to its remoteness.</p>

<p>Various parts of the training area have been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), an EU Special Area of Conservation (SAC), as well as a Special Protection Area (SPA).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Access restrictions</h3>

<p>When the ranges are used for live firing, red flags (day) or red lights (night) are displayed: access is prohibited.</p>
</div>

<h3>Access opportunities</h3>

<p>There are 2 main ways of accessing Cape Wrath Training Area:</p>

<h4>By ferry and minibus</h4>

<p>The main access to the range area is via the passenger ferry across the Kyle of Durness from Keoldale. This ferry runs sporadically from May to September. The frequency of the service is dependent on the tide and weather conditions. Two hours either side of low tide the service may stop altogether. The ferry may operate outside these months by prior arrangement.</p>

<p>On the Cape side of the Kyle, a minibus service operates between the ferry landing point and the Cape Wrath lighthouse along the public road. This service is privately operated and excursions from the ferry to the lighthouse and back take approximately 2 ½ hours.</p>

<p>The public road across the Cape runs for approximately 12 miles thus most people accessing the lighthouse via the ferry make use of this service at least one way. 10 miles of the road are within the Cape Wrath Training Area. The public road is closed during live firing periods. The ferry and minibus service are also curtailed during these periods.</p>

<h4>On foot</h4>

<p>The other main way to access Cape Wrath is to walk from Blairmore, in the south, via the Sandwood estate owned by John Muir Trust, to Cape Wrath Lighthouse. Much of this route is unmarked, over rough and open moorland, and is not recommended for inexperienced walkers.</p>

<p>Walkers are advised to check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/scotland-firing-times">firing times</a> before setting off on this route. This route forms the final section of the Cape Wrath Trail, a long-distance route from Fort William of just under 200 miles.</p>

The island area comprises a mixture of open grassland and reed beds. This variety of habitat, in conjunction with the surrounding wetlands, makes Thorney Island one of the best MOD sites for ornithology, with species including brent geese, oystercatchers, lapwings, curlews, skylarks and shelduck. Pilsey Island, to the south of Thorney Island, is an RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) reserve.</p>

<p>Dartmoor Training Area is located in West Devon, south of Okehampton.</p>

<h3>Site description</h3>

<p>Military training has taken place on Dartmoor since the early 1800s. It was used intensively for tactical exercises with live ammunition by the allies during the Second World War. Today the MOD uses (by freehold, lease, or licence) about 12,760 hectares of the National Park’s 94,400 hectares. The Dartmoor Training Area is used for light forces’ exercises, mostly for Royal Marines and other units based in the southwest.</p>

<h3>Access restrictions</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>When the ranges are used for live firing, red flags (day) or red lights (night) are displayed: access is prohibited.</p>
</div>

<h3>Access opportunities</h3>

<p>Three parts of Dartmoor training areas are used for live firing: Okehampton, Merrivale and Willsworthy.</p>

<p>When not in use for live firing, this land is used for dry training with blank ammunition and although the noise of training may be heard, no restrictions are placed on the public roaming over the open moor. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dartmoor-firing-programme">Dartmoor firing times</a> need to be checked and warning signals heeded when wishing to walk within these ranges. To assist public access, the guaranteed non live firing periods are shown on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dartmoor-guaranteed-public-access">Dartmoor guaranteed access page</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/living-and-working/access-and-land-management/military-on-dartmoor" rel="external">Dartmoor Training Area</a> site.</p>

<p>Please note that land over which MOD byelaws apply is excluded from the Countryside and Rights of Way Act. Consequently, the range danger areas are not depicted as public access land on Ordnance Survey maps.</p>

<p>The Dartmoor National Park Authority organises an extensive and varied programme of guided walks throughout the year. A large proportion of the guided walk starting points are accessible by public transport and walks are free if you show your valid local public transport travel ticket to the guide.</p>

<p>To supplement the Coastal Path, the MOD has opened a permissive path, which continues the route following the red and white range poles south above the beach to the MOD boundary. This provides the opportunity for a circular walk from Perranporth that takes in the beach, the dune ridge and the adjoining dune grassland around the Perran Sands Holiday Centre.</p>

<p>This walk can be extended to pass by the site of St Piran’s Oratory and the recently excavated St Piran’s Church, which lie just south of the MOD boundary.
