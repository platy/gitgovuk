<h2 id="before-the-day-of-your-hearing">Before the day of your hearing</h2>

<p>Courts are open for face to face hearings. We’ve introduced measures to make sure that judges, legal professionals, staff and all those attending hearings can maintain effective social distancing.  We may also hear certain hearings by telephone or video, or with certain parties joining in person with others on the telephone or video.</p>

<p>Your hearing notice will inform you whether your hearing is taking place in person, via video or telephone. If you are self-isolating and unable to attend in person, please contact the court or tribunal immediately so alternative arrangements can be considered.</p>

<p>Read our guide to help you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/keeping-court-and-tribunal-buildings-safe-secure-and-clean" class="govuk-link">prepare for your visit to a court or tribunal during the coronavirus outbreak</a>.</p>

<p>You should not come to any of our court and tribunal buildings if you have coronavirus symptoms, if you have tested positive for coronavirus, or if you have been instructed by the NHS to self-isolate. Please <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-court-tribunal" class="govuk-link">contact the court or tribunal</a> before you are due to attend so that they can make appropriate arrangements for your hearing.</p>

<p>Individuals must self-isolate when returning from a country that is not in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel corridor</a>.  While <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1045/regulation/2/made" class="govuk-link">public health legislation</a> allows those involved in legal proceedings to come out of this self-isolation when necessary, you must consult with the court or tribunal first who will consider and decide on appropriate arrangements.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://courttribunalfinder.service.gov.uk/search/" class="govuk-link">Contact your court or tribunal</a> immediately if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cannot travel because the venue is too far, or you cannot get to the venue</li>
  <li>need to change the date of your hearing; you’ll need to give a reason for the judge to consider. We’ll contact you as soon as possible to let you know if it’s possible</li>
  <li>need additional support or reasonable adjustments; for example, because of a disability, or you have concerns about security on the day of your hearing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coming-to-a-court-or-tribunal-to-and-from-areas-with-high-covid-alert-levels-or-local-restrictions-in-place">Coming to a court or tribunal to and from areas with high COVID alert levels or local restrictions in place</h2>

<p>The essential work of courts and tribunals continues. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-levels-what-you-need-to-know" class="govuk-link">Local COVID alert levels</a> in England and local restrictions in England, Wales and Scotland still allow people to travel for work when necessary. This includes all those required to attend a court or tribunal, including jurors, victims, witnesses, defendants and complainants. This means that you can travel to and from an area with a high COVID alert level.  You may find it helpful to bring your hearing letter with you.</p>

<p>While <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1045/regulation/2/made" class="govuk-link">public health legislation</a> allows those involved in legal proceedings to come out of self-isolation when necessary, you must consult with the court or tribunal first who will consider and decide on appropriate arrangements.</p>

<p>See more general advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-expect-coming-to-a-court-or-tribunal" class="govuk-link">what to expect going to a court or tribunal</a> on the day.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-day-of-your-hearing">On the day of your hearing</h2>

<h3 id="social-distancing-rules">Social distancing rules</h3>

<p>All our buildings are COVID-secure, with social distancing arrangements in place. In line with government guidelines, we have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/keeping-court-and-tribunal-buildings-safe-secure-and-clean#social-distancing-within-the-building" class="govuk-link">applied social distancing rules in our buildings</a>.</p>

<p>Where possible, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep a 2m distance from others; you must do this when queuing to get into the building and washroom, going through security and going in and out of courtrooms</li>
  <li>leave empty seats between you and other people in the waiting area</li>
</ul>

<p>Court staff will follow these rules when interacting with you.</p>

<h3 id="arrangements-in-court">Arrangements in court</h3>

<p>You can bring someone with you for support – such as a friend or family member.  Space in waiting areas and the public gallery will be limited while the court or tribunal observes social-distancing arrangements.  Some witnesses may additionally have specialist support – such as an Independent Domestic Violence Adviser (ISVA) or Independent Sexual Violence Adviser – available to support them on the day.</p>

<p>The rule of six does not apply to the court and tribunal setting.  Groups can be larger than six and from different households where individuals are fulfilling a legal obligation, such as attending court or jury service.  Individuals will need to observe social distancing arrangements that are in place.</p>

<h3 id="wear-a-face-covering">Wear a face covering</h3>

<p>Court and tribunal users must wear a face covering in all public and communal parts of our buildings in England and Wales. You can ask a member of staff for a face covering if you need one, though we request that you bring your own.</p>

<p>You do not need to wear a face covering if you have a practical reason (exemption) not to. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have disability or health issue that makes it difficult</li>
  <li>wearing one will cause you severe distress</li>
  <li>a deaf person you support needs to read your lips</li>
  <li>you are eating, drinking or taking medicine</li>
</ul>

<p>Children under the age of 11 (in England and Wales) do not need to wear a face covering.</p>

<p>If you have a reason why you cannot wear a face covering, you may find it helpful to wear a lanyard with an exemption card or to carry an exemption card with you. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">Exemption cards are available to download on GOV.UK</a>, or see our <span id="attachment_4620594" class="attachment-inline"><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/908308/HMCTS_Face_covering_exemption_-_for_homeprinting.pdf" class="govuk-link">HMCTS example exemption card</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">108KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">1 page</span>)</span>.</p>

<p>You may be asked to temporarily remove your face covering for identification purposes. If you are presenting evidence in the courtroom, the judge or magistrate may also ask you to take your face covering off temporarily.
If you need to communicate with someone who relies on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound, they may ask you to take your face covering off.</p>

<p>Those people using our buildings in Scotland may also wear face coverings, but they remain optional.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">government advice on face coverings (England)</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public" class="govuk-link">Face coverings: guidance for public (Wales)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="going-through-security">Going through security</h3>

<p>When you enter the building, our security officers will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give you instructions to help them search your bags at a 2m distance</li>
  <li>ask you to go through an archway detector</li>
</ul>

<p>If our security officers need to search you, they will use a hand-held detector to search you at a close distance. They will not touch you, and you’ll be facing your back to the officer.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/entering-court-or-tribunal-building" class="govuk-link">what things you can and cannot bring when going through security</a>.</p>

<h3 id="make-sure-you-bring-enough-food-and-bottled-water-with-you-for-your-visit">Make sure you bring enough food and bottled water with you for your visit</h3>

<p>We have closed our water fountains (these are the water dispensers that you drink water directly from) and we have removed water carafes and glasses from the court rooms. You’ll be able to take bottled water into the hearing room.</p>

<p>Water coolers/dispensers (where you fill cups and drinking bottles) and vending machines are still in use in some buildings. We’ll clean these frequently. You should wash your hands after use.
As we do not provide refreshments in all our buildings, you can bring your own food and drink in the waiting area.</p>

<h3 id="cleaning-measures">Cleaning measures</h3>

<p>We have introduced extra cleaning measures to make our buildings safer for you and our staff. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introducing cleaners to do deep and frequent cleanings throughout the day</li>
  <li>checking washrooms frequently to make sure they’re well-stocked</li>
  <li>closing buildings where there are safety concerns</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="let-us-know-if-something-is-not-right">Let us know if something is not right</h3>

<p>If you see anything we could improve or that does not comply with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/keeping-court-and-tribunal-buildings-safe-secure-and-clean" class="govuk-link">advice on social distancing and cleanliness in our buildings</a>, please let a member of staff know or use our <a rel="external" href="https://let-us-know.form.service.justice.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">“Let us know service”</a>.</p>
