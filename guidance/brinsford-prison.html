<p>All visitors will be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Visitors should dress appropriately. You may be turned away if you are wearing items like revealing clothing or clothing with offensive slogans or imagery.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Brinsford</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Brinsford.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms but these cannot receive incoming calls so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Brinsford using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You can also attach photos and receive replies.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Brinsford</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Brinsford are given a list of approved items that they  can order through a catalogue system. You can send them money for this.</p>

<p>Prisoners can also apply to have their own clothes sent to them. If you receive an approved clothing application, you can send in clothes. You should include a copy of the approved application in the parcel. Make sure to also include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
