<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This page brings together information leaseholders and other residents should be aware of on fire safety, and remediation of historic building safety defects – including who is responsible for paying for remediation works. It sets out the ways in which leaseholders are protected from historic costs through the Building Safety Act. These protections came into force on 21 July 2022. It also has useful links to information about related issues such as insurance and mortgages on properties in remediation schemes.</p>

<h2>How fire safety is managed in multi-occupancy residential buildings</h2>

<p>The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (the Fire Safety Order) regulates fire safety in all non-domestic premises including the common parts of multi-occupied residential buildings. The Fire Safety Order places duties on “Responsible Persons”, usually the owner or manager of a multi-occupied residential building, to ensure that the premises are safe.</p>

<p>The Fire Safety Act 2021 clarified that the structure, external walls, and flat entrance doors of multi-occupied residential buildings are common parts within the scope of the Fire Safety Order and should be considered as part of a building’s Fire Risk Assessment.</p>

<p>The Building Safety Act 2022 is introducing further amendments to the Fire Safety Order to strengthen its requirements. There is a new duty on the Responsible Person to ensure that those they appoint to assist them in completing an FRA have the competence to do so. It also requires Responsible Persons to share fire safety information with residents of multi-occupied residential buildings.</p>

<p>Below are the links to further information on how the Fire Safety Order and its regulations will help manage fire safety in your multi-occupied residential building.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-england-regulations-2022">Fire Safety (England) Regulations 2022 factsheet</a></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This factsheet provides information about the Fire Safety regulations to residents and other interested parties. It sets out the responsibilities of the Responsible Person and what will need to be presented to the local fire and rescue service to ensure a building is fire safe.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This factsheet provides information on the Amendments to the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 and how they will impact residents. The Fire Safety Order regulates fire safety in all non-domestic buildings and in the common parts of multi-occupied residential buildings. Under the Fire Safety Order, the responsible person must make a ‘suitable and sufficient’ assessment of the fire safety risks which exist and take general fire precautions to mitigate against these.</p>

<p>This factsheet includes the latest FAQs on Fire Risk Assessments (FRAs), what they are, and what residents may need to do. An FRA looks at the possible risk to people from fire and ensures that the chance of a fire happening in communal areas is minimised. It is a legal requirement for all blocks of flats.</p>

<h2>How government is protecting leaseholders from building safety remediation costs</h2>

<p>The government has introduced a set of laws referred to collectively as the ‘leaseholder protections’, which came into force on 28 June 2022. These laws grant qualifying leaseholders significant new protections from paying for historic building safety remediation costs.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-leaseholder-protections-guidance-for-leaseholders">Guidance on leaseholder protections</a></p>

<div class="example">
<p>This link provides a plain English explanation of the implications of the leaseholder protections in the Building Safety Act 2022, how leaseholders will be protected and how remediation is being funded. This guidance explains the real-world implications of these legal changes, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How leaseholders can tell if they are protected by the new laws</li>
  <li>How the changes in the law affect leases, including those where the terms of a lease would contradict the new protections</li>
  <li>The relevant protections where the building has a cladding defect that needs to be fixed</li>
  <li>The relevant legal protections where the building has a non-cladding defect that needs to be fixed</li>
  <li>How remediation costs will be paid for now that leaseholders are now protected</li>
  <li>The obligations placed onto the freeholder/owner, and what happens when these are not met.</li>
</ul>

This guidance provides an overview of how the contribution caps work and what interim measures such as waking watches also count towards these contributions.</p>

<h2>How remediation work is being delivered</h2>

<p>The government is on the side of leaseholders and residents. It is committed to ensuring that people are safe and feel safe in their homes, both now and in the future.</p>

<p>Developers have committed to remediate life critical fire safety works in buildings over 11 metres that they have played a role in developing or refurbishing over the last 30 years in England. Developers making this commitment have also agreed to reimburse any funding received from government remediation programmes in relation to buildings they had a role in developing or refurbishing.</p>

<p>The Building Safety Fund, a government programme, also protects leaseholders from the cost of addressing fire-safety risks caused by unsafe cladding systems on high-rise residential buildings (buildings over 17.7 metres). The BSF applies where eligible buildings do not have a funding solution, such as developer-led remediation, in place. A scheme for medium rise buildings (11-18 metres) is also being established.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

<h2>Mortgage lending</h2>

<p>Government has taken action on resolving lending challenges that prevent many leaseholders in flats from selling and moving on.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>On 15 July 2022, UK Finance, the Buildings Societies Association (BSA) and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) issued&nbsp;the above statement. This clarifies that the six largest mortgage lenders: Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, NatWest and Santander have confirmed that they will now lend on buildings that will be remediated by the developers that built them, or are in a government-funded remediation scheme, or a leaseholder is covered by the leaseholder is a qualifying leaseholder for the protections described above in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-government-is-protecting-leaseholders-from-building-safety-remediation-costs">‘How government is protecting leaseholders from building safety remediation costs’</a> section.</p>

<p>This link will direct you to the RICs frequently asked questions page for EWS1 forms. An EWS1 form is designed to check over residential properties such as blocks of flats and focuses on the external wall system (EWS) of a residential building, including cladding, insulation and fire brake systems. The requirement for an EWS1 form is determined by the lending policies of banks and building societies and is not a statutory or regulatory requirement. Where an EWS1 is not necessary a PAS9980 assessment (see below) may be required.</p>

<p>If you are looking for information about any other issues related to fire safety and remediation you may find the following links useful. Alternatively, you may benefit from seeking free initial advice via the Leasehold Advisory Service (LEASE), the specialist advisory body funded by the department to provide assistance to leaseholders.</p>
