<h2 id="residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Belgium</a>.</p>

<p>You must carry photographic ID at all times.</p>

<p>You must register at your local town hall (commune/gemeente) within 8 days of arriving in Belgium. You might be asked to bring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 passport-sized photos</li>
  <li>originals and copies of your passport</li>
  <li>the lease for your apartment or house</li>
  <li>documents proving you can support yourself in Belgium, such as your employment contract or proof of your pension</li>
  <li>proof of health insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be given further forms for you and/or your employer to complete and return.</p>

<p>The police will verify your address by making a house call. If you’re not at home when a police officer calls, the officer will leave a card giving you an appointment at your local police station.</p>

<p>Once the police have verified your address, you’ll get a statement of registration and you can apply for an electronic residence card, valid for 5 years, at a cost of around €20.</p>

<p>There are many types of residency cards in Belgium, the following are the most relevant for UK nationals resident in Belgium:</p>

<ul>
  <li>E card: for EU citizens resident in Belgium less than 5 years</li>
  <li>E+ card: for EU citizens resident in Belgium more than 5 years</li>
  <li>F card: for non-EU spouses of an EU citizen, resident in Belgium less than 5 years</li>
  <li>F+ card: for non-EU spouses of an EU citizen, resident in Belgium more than 5 years</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="residency-after-brexit">Residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the implementation period, you will receive a letter from your commune/gemeente explaining how to obtain a new residency card.</p>

<p>There will be no change in residency rules or registration procedures if you arrive in Belgium before the end of the implementation period on 31 December 2020. UK nationals legally resident in Belgium before the implementation period ends will be able to stay.</p>

<p>Read the Belgian government’s <a rel="external" href="https://dofi.ibz.be/sites/dvzoe/EN/Application-guides/Pages/Brexit-Deal.aspx" class="govuk-link">guidance on residency rights if there is a deal</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that residency is separate to nationality.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register with a healthcare insurer (mutuelle/ziekenfonds) to access the healthcare system if you are resident in Belgium. If you are working, both you and your employer will make contributions to your social security and healthcare system through the mutuelle/ziekenfonds. The amount you have to pay is set by the Belgian government.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on who can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-belgium/" class="govuk-link">access healthcare in Belgium and how to register.</a></p>

<p>When you visit a doctor or pharmacist, you need to pay and then send the receipt to your mutuelle/ziekenfonds. The amount you’ll be refunded depends on the health services covered by your insurance.</p>

<p>If you live in Belgium and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Belgium, you must not use your EHIC from the UK to access healthcare in Belgium.</p>

<p>When you travel from Belgium for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">read our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#brexit-update" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>If you are living in Belgium or move there permanently before 31 December 2020 you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Belgium as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<p>You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the end of the implementation period on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the Schengen area or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>We will update these pages with details of any changes to the rules as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-belgium" class="govuk-link">sign up for updates</a> to this guidance.</p>

You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h3 id="driving-after-brexit">Driving after Brexit</h3>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-belgium">Working in Belgium</h2>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in Belgium you have the right to work in Belgium. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>To apply for a job you may need to apply for a:</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-belgium-after-brexit">Studying in Belgium after Brexit</h3>

<p>If you have already been recognised by an EU country as holding valid professional qualifications, this will remain valid after Brexit.</p>

<p>If you have not had your professional qualifications recognised, you will have until the end of the implementation period on 31 December 2020 to submit an application under the current rules.</p>

<p>If you need to take action to secure the recognition of your academic or professional qualification in Belgium, <a rel="external" href="https://business.belgium.be/en/managing_your_business/qualifications_professionnelles" class="govuk-link">visit the Business Belgium website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Belgium to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Read guidance about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk" class="govuk-link">telling HMRC if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Belgium.</p>

<p>All residents must declare assets outside Belgium, including bank accounts, securities, rights, insurance, annuities and property. The declaration is separate to the annual tax return, and there are severe penalties and criminal charges if you do not comply.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> so that you protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU or EEA and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<p>Brexit will not change existing double-taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Belgium.</p>
