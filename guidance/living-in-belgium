<h2 id="residency">Residency</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Belgium</a>.</p>

<p>You must carry an ID at all times.</p>

<p>You must register at your local town hall (commune/gemeente) within 8 days of arriving in Belgium. You might be asked to bring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 passport-sized photos</li>
  <li>originals and copies of your passport</li>
  <li>the lease for your apartment or house</li>
  <li>documents proving you can support yourself in Belgium, such as your employment contract or proof of your pension</li>
  <li>proof of health insurance</li>
  <li>the required fee, which is usually €20</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be given further forms for you or/and your employer to complete and return.</p>

<p>The police will verify your address by making a house call. If you’re not at home when a police officer calls, the officer will leave a card giving you an appointment at your local police station.</p>

<p>Once the police have verified your address, you’ll get a statement of registration and you can apply for an electronic residence card, valid for 5 years.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, there will be no change in residency rules or registration procedures for British citizens arriving in Belgium till the end of December 2020.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, British citizens arriving in Belgium will be subject to the residency rules and registration procedures for third country nationals, with a few exceptions. We will update this page as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">You can apply for or renew your British passport online from Belgium.</a> If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-eu-exit">Passports and travel after EU Exit</h3>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is suitable for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be new travel rules.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission has proposed that British citizens would not need a visa for short stays in the Schengen area or elsewhere in the EU. You may be able to stay for up to 90 days in any EU country, within a 180 days period.</p>

<p>Please read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/entry-requirements">travel advice for Belgium on entry requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will be part of the next phase of negotiations.</p>

<p>Please read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium">travel advice for Belgium</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register with a health care insurer (mutuelle/ziekenfonds) to access the healthcare system. Both you and your employer must make contributions to your social security and health care system through the mutuelle/ziekenfonds. The amount you have to pay is set by the Belgian government.</p>

<p>When you visit a doctor or pharmacist, you need to pay and then send the receipt to your mutuelle/ziekenfonds. The amount you’ll be refunded depends on the health services covered by your insurance.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Belgium, you should not be using an European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Belgium.</p>

<p>You can read the NHS’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-belgium/">healthcare in Belgium</a>.</p>

<p>You can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/health">health advice for Belgium</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/belgium-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">find English-speaking doctors</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-eu-exit">Healthcare after EU Exit</h3>

<p>Please <a rel="external" href="https://www.belgium.be/en/brexit/i_am_private_citizen/british_citizens_belgium/health_and_social_security_entitlements">consult the Belgian site on health and social security entitlements</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal your current rights on access to healthcare will continue until the end of 2020.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Belgian Federal government has approved a bill that, contingent on reciprocity, will preserve current social security rights, including healthcare, for British citizens already resident in Belgium, unaffected until 31 December 2020. This bill will become law applicable to all branches of social security that are part of the federal competence in Belgium (pensions, unemployment benefits, healthcare, incapacity and invalidity benefits, benefits for occupational accidents and illness).</p>

<h2 id="working-in-belgium">Working in Belgium</h2>

<p>If you registered as a resident in Belgium whilst the UK was a member of the European Union, you have the right to work in Belgium whether the UK has left with a deal or without a deal. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK police certificate</a></li>
  <li>Belgian criminal records certificate (extrait de casier judiciaire/uittreksel uit het strafregister), which you can request at your local town hall (commune/gemeente)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the EU leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/belgium-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>Please also consult the Flemish, Wallonian and Brussels Capital guidance depending on where you live and where you want to set up business, as there are some temporary exemptions for British nationals arriving in Belgium after the UK leaves the EU but before 31 December 2020.</p>

<h2 id="studying-in-belgium">Studying in Belgium</h2>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, there will be no change for UK nationals studying in Belgium until the end of 2020.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Flemish government has said that those already in education and higher education can continue until the end of the academic year 2020/2021. From discussions with the governments of Wallonia and Brussels Capital, we know they have legislation in train to do the same. We will provide links to that legislation when it is available.</p>

<p>UK students in Belgium can also read the no deal guidance on:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Belgium to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. You can ask the relevant tax authority individual questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>You can read guidance about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">telling HMRC if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">the tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/belgium/index_en.htm">paying income tax in Belgium</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Belgium.</p>

<p>All residents must declare assets outside Belgium, including bank accounts, securities, rights, insurance, annuities and property. The declaration is separate to the annual tax return, and there are severe penalties and criminal charges for not doing this.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> so that you protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-eu-exit">Money and tax after EU Exit</h3>

<p>The UK’s double taxation agreement with Belgium will not change once the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in Belgium. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial service if there is no Brexit deal</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Belgium, you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">UK state pension</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension">new UK state pension</a>
</li>
  <li>your <a rel="external" href="https://www.sfpd.fgov.be/">Belgium pension</a> if you’ve worked in Belgium, through the Federal Pensions Service</li>
  <li>your <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/retire-abroad/state-pensions-abroad/index_en.htm">pension from working abroad</a>, if you have worked in other EU countries.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">‘life certificate’ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible - your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-eu-exit">Pensions after EU Exit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK state pension to those eligible after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Belgium, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Belgian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Belgium.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our guidance on which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">benefits you can claim if you live abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">check which benefits you can claim while you’re abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit cannot be paid to you.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time you’ve worked in the UK from HMRC</a> if you are asked for this.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for Belgian benefits. To find out if you are entitled to Belgian benefits and how to claim them, you can:</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-eu-exit">Benefits after EU Exit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Belgium, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Belgium contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Belgian Federal Government has approved a <a rel="external" href="https://www.belgium.be/en/brexit/i_am_private_citizen/british_citizens_belgium/health_and_social_security_entitlements">bill that will keep the social security situation of British citizens in Belgium unaffected until 31 December 2020</a>, to honour the principle of reciprocity between Belgium and the UK.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-belgium">Driving in Belgium</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Belgium, you should exchange your UK licence for a Belgian driving licence before the UK leaves the EU, as your UK licence may no longer be valid after the UK leaves the EU. You can still use your Belgian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Belgium, read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>

</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/safety-and-security">road travel in Belgium</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When driving in Belgium, you should always have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your driving licence</li>
  <li>your car papers</li>
  <li>your insurance paper</li>
  <li>your MOT or Control technique certificate</li>
  <li>your passport or ID and those of your passengers</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://mobilit.belgium.be/en/road_traffic/driving_licence/brexit">guidance on driving licences for residents and visitors</a> provided by the Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility.</p>

<h3 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h3>

<p>Contact your vehicle insurance provider to obtain a motor insurance Green Card. The Green Card for your vehicle covers your trailer. If your trailer is not attached or exceeds 500 kg you will need an additional Green Card for it.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/driving-abroad/validity-tourist/belgium/index_en.htm">guidance on car insurance validity</a> when travelling to Belgium.</p>

<h3 id="bringing-a-uk-registered-vehicle">Bringing a UK-registered vehicle</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>If you spend more than 6 months of the year in Belgium with your UK-registered car, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.belgium.be/fr/mobilite/vehicules/immatriculation/bureaux_de_la_div">register your vehicle with the Belgian authorities</a>. You can read the European Union’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/belgium/index_en.htm">car registration rules and taxes</a>. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h3 id="driving-after-eu-exit">Driving after EU Exit</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, driving licence rules will stay the same during the implementation period.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://mobilit.belgium.be/en/road_traffic/driving_licence/brexit">guidance on driving licences for residents and visitors</a> provided by the Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility.</p>

<p>Whilst the UK is a member of the EU, if you’re resident in Belgium, <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/elections-abroad/index_en.htm">you can vote and stand in Belgian local municipal and European parliamentary elections</a>. To do so, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register on the municipal register where you live</li>
  <li>formally declare your intention to vote and register on the local electoral roll</li>
  <li>confirm your status every 2 to 5 years to remain registered and be able to vote</li>

<h3 id="voting-after-eu-exit">Voting after EU Exit</h3>

<p>Once the UK leaves the EU, UK nationals will no longer be eligible to vote in European Parliament elections.</p>

<p>We are pursuing bilateral arrangements with individual Member States to secure the right to vote in local elections for UK nationals living in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK. UK nationals resident in Belgium for more than 5 years will continue to be able to vote in local elections after the UK leaves the EU.</p>
