<h2 id="residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Belgium</a>.</p>

<p>You must carry photographic ID at all times.</p>

<p>You must register at your local town hall (commune/gemeente) within 8 days of arriving in Belgium. You might be asked to bring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 passport-sized photos</li>
  <li>originals and copies of your passport</li>
  <li>the lease for your apartment or house</li>
  <li>documents proving you can support yourself in Belgium, such as your employment contract or proof of your pension</li>
  <li>proof of health insurance</li>
  <li>the required fee, which is usually â‚¬20</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be given further forms for you and/or your employer to complete and return.</p>

<p>The police will verify your address by making a house call. If youâ€™re not at home when a police officer calls, the officer will leave a card giving you an appointment at your local police station.</p>

<p>Once the police have verified your address, youâ€™ll get a statement of registration and you can apply for an electronic residence card, valid for 5 years.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, there will be no change in residency rules or registration procedures for British citizens arriving in Belgium until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, British citizens arriving in Belgium will be subject to the residency rules and registration procedures for third country nationals, with a few exceptions. We will update this page as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">You can apply for or renew your British passport online</a> from Belgium.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. During this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU.</a> You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180-day period. You should retain evidence of travel  (such as train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register with a healthcare insurer (mutuelle/ziekenfonds) to access the healthcare system if you are resident in Belgium. If you are working, both you and your employer will make contributions to your social security and healthcare system through the mutuelle/ziekenfonds. The amount you have to pay is set by the Belgian government.</p>

<p>Read the NHS guidance on who can <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-belgium/">access healthcare in Belgium and how to register.</a></p>

<p>When you visit a doctor or pharmacist, you need to pay and then send the receipt to your mutuelle/ziekenfonds. The amount youâ€™ll be refunded depends on the health services covered by your insurance.</p>

<p>If you live in Belgium and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Belgium, you must not use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Belgium.</p>

<p>When you travel from Belgium for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>

<p>If there is a deal your current rights on access to healthcare will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Belgium.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, the Belgian Federal government has approved a bill that, contingent on reciprocity, will preserve current social security rights, including healthcare, for British citizens already resident in Belgium until 31 December 2020. This bill will become law applicable to all branches of social security that are part of the federal competence in Belgium (pensions, unemployment benefits, healthcare, incapacity and invalidity benefits, benefits for occupational accidents and illness).</p>

<p>If you currently have your healthcare costs paid for by the UK government, we can help if you are asked to pay for treatment during the first 6 months after Brexit. To organise a payment, you must give your healthcare providerâ€™s details to the NHS Business Services Authorityâ€™s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-belgium/">NHS guidance on healthcare for UK nationals living in Belgium and how it may change after Brexit. </a></p>

<h2 id="working-in-belgium">Working in Belgium</h2>

<p>If you registered as a resident in Belgium whilst the UK was a member of the European Union, you have the right to work in Belgium whether the UK has left with a deal or without a deal. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>To apply for a job you may need to apply for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK police certificate</a></li>
  <li>Belgian criminal records certificate (extrait de casier judiciaire/uittreksel uit het strafregister), which you can request at your local town hall (commune/gemeente)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-in-belgium-after-brexit">Working in Belgium after Brexit</h2>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/belgium-providing-services-after-eu-exit/">guidance on providing services after Brexit</a> if you plan to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession.</p>

<p>Consult the Flemish, Wallonian and Brussels Capital guidance depending on where you live and where you want to set up business. There are some temporary exemptions for UK nationals arriving in Belgium after Brexit but before 31 December 2020.</p>

<h2 id="education-and-professional-qualifications">Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>If there is a deal, there will be no change for UK nationals studying in Belgium until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, the Flemish government has said that those already in education and higher education can continue until the end of the 2020/2021 academic year.   The governments of Wallonia and Brussels Capital are considering legislation. We will provide links to that legislation when it is available.</p>

<p>The European Commission has published <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/slides_professional-qualifications-ip-justice-consumers_en.pdf">guidance on professional qualifications.</a> If you have already been recognised by an EU country as holding valid professional qualifications, this will remain valid after Brexit. If you hold qualifications obtained in the UK before Brexit, you should obtain recognition in a EU27 Member State before Brexit.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Belgium to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Belgium.</p>

<p>All residents must declare assets outside Belgium, including bank accounts, securities, rights, insurance, annuities and property. The declaration is separate to the annual tax return, and there are severe penalties and criminal charges if you do not comply.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> so that you protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<p>If the end date on your form is after 31 October 2019, you should contact theâ€¯relevant EU, EEA or Swiss authorityâ€¯to confirm whether you need to start paying social security contributions in that country after 31 October, as well as UK National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-brexit">Money and tax after Brexit</h3>

<p>Brexit will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Belgium.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in Belgium.

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">â€˜life certificateâ€™ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible â€“ your payments may be suspended if you donâ€™t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-brexit">Pensions after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay a State Pension to those eligible in the EU after Brexit. Your UK State Pension will be uprated in April 2020, 2021 and 2022 if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland.</p>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Belgium, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Belgian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>Also, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions if thereâ€™s no deal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-brexit">Benefits after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK State Pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Belgium, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Belgium contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, the Belgian Federal Government has approved <a rel="external" href="https://www.belgium.be/en/brexit/i_am_private_citizen/british_citizens_belgium/health_and_social_security_entitlements">a bill that will keep the social security situation of British citizens in Belgium unaffected until 31 December 2020</a>, to honour the principle of reciprocity between Belgium and the UK.</p>
