<p>The COVID-19 testing for hospices was updated on 24 August to reflect <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/regular-asymptomatic-testing-paused-in-additional-settings">announced changes on pausing routine asymptomatic testing</a>, which will go live on 31 August. Services should not implement this new guidance until 31 August; until then <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20220811164603/https:/www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-hospices" rel="external">original guidance can be found in the National Archives</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>From 31 August 2022, in line with public health advice and as set out in the Living with COVID-19 strategy, routine asymptomatic testing in hospices will be paused. The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) is continuing to make symptomatic and rapid response coronavirus (COVID-19) testing available to all hospice staff in England. Hospice patients will continue to have access to symptomatic testing and testing on admission in England. Separate arrangements are in place for hospices in Scotland and Wales. This guidance will be kept under review.</p>

<p>All registered hospices have been contacted with details of how to apply for test kits for their staff and patients. Hospices will be responsible for ordering test kits for both ‘inpatient’ and ‘community-based’ settings.</p>

<h3>Webinars</h3>

<p>For more information you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/portal.jsp?ei=1416043&amp;tp_key=228ba3ce61" rel="external">watch our recorded webinars</a>.</p>

<h2>1. Summary: testing for hospices</h2>

<h3>1.1 Types of COVID-19 test</h3>

<p>Polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests are over 99% effective and pick up positive results at early and late stages of infection. Completed tests are sent to a lab for processing.</p>

<p>Rapid lateral flow (<abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr>) tests are effective at detecting virus in those with high levels of coronavirus in their system. Results are given within 30 minutes and kits do not need to be sent to labs for processing.</p>

<h3>1.2 About the service</h3>

<p>From 31 August 2022, asymptomatic staff testing and testing for visitors who provide close personal care to hospice patients will be paused.</p>

<p>Staff are no longer required to test unless they are symptomatic, or as part of a setting’s rapid response testing protocol.</p>

<p>Visitors to a setting are no longer required to test. This includes visitors who may have previously accessed testing as a result of providing personal care to a patient. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#visitortesting">section 1.5</a> for more information.</p>

<p>From 31 August 2022, this service now covers testing for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff and patients who show COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>rapid response testing, in the instance of an outbreak</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Staff symptomatic testing</h3>

<p>Anyone who has symptoms of a respiratory infection and a high temperature, or symptoms of a respiratory infection and does not feel well enough to work, is advised to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Staff in these circumstances should conduct an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test on the day they start to feel unwell (day 0).</p>

<p>Hospice staff who are concerned they may be experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 are able to access <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> tests from their employer (free tests are provided for symptomatic testing and staff should ensure they have some at home for this purpose). If this test result is negative, they should take another test 48 hours later, continuing to stay away from work during this 48-hour period. If the second test is also negative, they can return to work if they feel well enough to do so.</p>

<p>If either of the test results are positive, then they should follow the guidance for staff who test positive.</p>

<p>Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19#symptoms-of-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19">what constitutes a symptom of a respiratory infection</a> as well as what to do if a staff member is concerned they may be experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement/covid-19-supplement-to-the-infection-prevention-and-control-resource-for-adult-social-care">COVID-19 supplement to the infection prevention and control resource for adult social care</a>.</p>

<p>Further information on reading <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> results can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#LFDKIT">section 4</a> of this document.</p>

<p>Hospice settings will be able to order <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test kits for symptomatic testing based on the number of symptomatic staff and patients they have had over the past 6 weeks. Hospice settings will be able to make one symptomatic testing order every 42 days.</p>

<p>If the number of symptomatic staff increases within the 42 day period in a setting, a manual order of <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test kits can be requested through the 119 service.</p>

<h3>1.4 Patient testing</h3>

<h4>1.4.1 On admission</h4>

<p>Patients with a scheduled date of admission to a hospice as an inpatient from the community or a care setting will be eligible for a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test 72 hours before admission (if appropriate) and an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test on the day of admission.</p>

<p>If inpatients cannot be tested with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test (for example, unplanned or urgent admissions, or if they have tested positive in the last 90 days) then an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test on admission is sufficient.</p>

<p>Patients admitted to a hospice setting from an NHS hospital will be given a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test by the NHS hospital on discharge.</p>

<h4>1.4.2 Symptomatic</h4>

<p>Patients showing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19#symptoms-of-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19">symptoms of a respiratory infection</a> and a high temperature, or symptoms of a respiratory infection and do not feel well enough to take part in usual activities should be tested with one <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test on the day the symptoms show (day 0).</p>

<p>For guidance on how to manage patients who may be displaying symptoms of COVID-19, and how to manage those that test positive, follow the advice given in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement/covid-19-supplement-to-the-infection-prevention-and-control-resource-for-adult-social-care#ipc-considerations-for-people-receiving-care">COVID-19 supplement to the infection prevention and control resource for adult social care</a>.</p>

<p>Hospice settings will be able to order symptomatic test kits for patients when ordering symptomatic tests for staff. This process is explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="#staff-symptomatic-testing">section 1.3</a>. Hospice settings will be provided with 2 test kits per symptomatic patient.</p>

<h3>1.5 Visitor testing</h3>

<p>All visitors (including those who may be providing personal care to a hospice patient) are no longer required to test. However, it is advised that individuals who are symptomatic and/or feeling unwell should not visit, even if they provide a negative COVID-19 result from a test obtained privately, are fully vaccinated and have received their booster vaccination. Transmissible viruses such as flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and norovirus can be just as dangerous to hospice patients as COVID-19. If visitors have any symptoms that suggest they may have other transmissible viruses and infections, such as a cough, high temperature, diarrhoea or vomiting, they should avoid visiting, if possible, until at least 5 days after they feel better.</p>

<p>Visits at the very end of life, that is, the last few days or hours of life should continue to be supported where possible in all circumstances. Infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures, for example providing personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) and allowing visitors to go directly to the patient’s room without accessing any communal areas, will help reduce transmission.</p>

<h3>1.6 Rapid response testing for hospices in England</h3>

<p>If one or more positive cases (staff or patient) are identified in a hospice, the hospice will be able to access rapid response <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> tests for all staff. Hospice staff working in the setting over the rapid response period should conduct daily rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> testing every day they are working for 5 days from the day the positive case is identified. Staff not working during this period do not need to test.</p>

<p>Any staff member who tests positive should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19">stay at home and try and avoid contact with other people</a>. Staff should not return to work until they have had two consecutive negative test results.</p>

<p>In addition to this, if any positive case is found in a hospice (either staff or patient), the hospice manager should contact their local health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>) immediately, and follow the advice given.</p>

<p>Hospice settings will be able to order ‘outbreak kits’ as an option on the test kit ordering portal.</p>

<h3>1.7 Regular asymptomatic testing for hospices in Wales and Scotland</h3>

<p>Wales:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all staff once a week using a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>patients upon admission (if appropriate)</li>
</ul>

<p>Scotland: testing is delivered locally through the local NHS.</p>

<h3>1.8 Guidance for staff who test positive</h3>

<p>For staff who have tested positive, hospices are advised to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19">guidance for people with symptoms of a respiratory infection including COVID-19</a>. In addition to this, staff should not attend work until they have had two consecutive negative <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test results, they feel well, and do not have a high temperature.</p>

<p>The first <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test should be taken 5 days after day 0 (the day symptoms started and or/when they tested positive), the second test should be taken 24 hours after the first. If both <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test results are negative, they may return to work immediately after the second negative <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test result (if symptoms have resolved).</p>

<p>If a staff member’s <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test result remains positive after 10 days, they should continue to take daily <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> tests. They can return to work after a single negative <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test result.</p>

<p>The likelihood of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test after 14 days is considerably lower. If the staff member’s <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test is still positive on day 14, they can stop daily testing and return to work on day 15. A risk assessment should be carried out and consideration given to redeployment.</p>

<p>For staff who test positive between days 10 and 14 and who do not have a high temperature or feel unwell, managers can undertake a risk assessment with the view to them returning to work.</p>

<h3>1.9 Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h3>

<p>Advice on testing patients on admission who have tested positive with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test in the last 90 days can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#PatientTesting">patient testing section of this document</a>.</p>

<p>Every <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFD</abbr> test must be registered online once completed.</p>

<p>Complete the registration as soon as the test result is determined. You need the ID number on the test strip to register the result.</p>

<p>Register your result here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">Report a COVID-19 rapid lateral flow test result</a>.</p>

<p>When using the online form, there is the option to create a user account. When you create a user account, you link your email address to your personal details. After you register your first rapid lateral flow test using your user account, your personal details will be saved, and you will not have to re-enter them when you register in future.</p>

<p>Creating an account should take about 2 minutes and will save about 5 minutes each time you register a test in the future.</p>

<p>Individuals or visitors reporting rapid lateral flow test results can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">sign in to an NHS account to report tests quicker</a> and also use the digital read service.</p>

<p>To register a test:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enter who you are reporting for.</li>
  <li>Select whether you would like to sign in or create an account or continue without an account.</li>
  <li>Follow the step-by-step instructions for creating an account (if required).</li>
  <li>Enter why you took the test (select testing for ‘a social care service’).</li>
  <li>Enter your role.</li>
  <li>Select ‘I work in an adult social care service’.</li>
  <li>Enter your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Select the appropriate country for where you live.</li>
  <li>Select the date of the test.</li>
  <li>Enter the test kit ID number (which can be found via the QR code).</li>
  <li>Add in the result of the test.</li>
</ol>
