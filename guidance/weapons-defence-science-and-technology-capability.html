<p>The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>) works with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> armed forces to understand and anticipate their needs for future weaponry and initiate projects that will deliver the right concepts and technology. Alongside industry, academia and international partners, we ensure the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> can meet the ‘asymmetric hard power challenge’ described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mod-science-and-technology-strategy-2020">Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) Science and Technology Strategy 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Weapons research has been identified and funded as a priority in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy">Integrated Review</a>, to support the modernisation of the armed forces and invest in advanced and next-generation technologies, such as advanced high-speed missiles and directed energy weapons.</p>

<p>Our work ranges from carrying out fundamental research and supporting the maturation of technology, to conducting technology and capability demonstrations and providing direct support to <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s equipment programmes.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Illustration of a laser being fired from a warship" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145607/DEW_on_T23_frigate_960x640.png"></div>
<figcaption><p>Computer-generated image illustrating the use of a directed energy weapon on a Type 23 Frigate. Crown Copyright.</p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>Accelerating science from concept to in-service</h2>

<p>We speed up and mature technical innovations, working with partners to develop ‘demonstrators’ (working prototypes) that quickly get the latest research into the hands of end users for testing in the field.</p>

<p>As part of Team Hersa, we are working with Defence Equipment and Support (<abbr title="Defence Equipment and Suppor">DE&amp;S</abbr>), other parts of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and industry partners to accelerate research in laser and radio frequency (<abbr title="radio frequency">RF</abbr>) directed energy weapons, and bring new technologies into service with the armed forces as soon as possible.</p>

<p>These next-generation technologies can give frontline personnel more flexibility, reduce the risk of collateral damage and be more cost effective than current systems. It builds on the work carried out by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dragonfire-laser-directed-energy-weapons">DragonFire</a> consortium.</p>

<p>As a result of this work, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/725m-investment-for-laser-and-radio-frequency-weapons">awarded contracts worth around £72.5 million to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> industry to produce advanced laser and radio frequency demonstrators</a>. They will be hosted on a Royal Navy Type 23 frigate, a British Army Wolfhound armoured vehicle and a MAN SV truck, enabling service personnel to trial the latest technology in real-world situations.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Illustration of a radio frequency field coming out of the back of an army truck." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145627/RF_directed_energy_weapons_960x640.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>Computer-generated image illustrating the use of radio frequency directed energy weapons, on a MAN SV truck. Crown Copyright.</p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>Investment to overcome complex challenges</h2>

<p>We bring together cutting-edge technologies developed by scientists and engineers in industry and academia, alongside our own expertise, to find ways to revolutionise the future battlefield and support modernisation initiatives such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.army.mod.uk/news-and-events/events/future-soldier/" rel="external">Future Soldier</a>.</p>

<p>For example, <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> is developing high speed and hypersonic weapon concepts. Hypersonic and high speed systems have the potential to enable weapons to travel further distances or be deployed before an adversary has time to react, giving armed forces a wider range of possible targets and keeping launch platforms safer.</p>

<p>As well as looking at our own use of these systems, we also need to protect our armed forces from potential adversaries using this type of weapon.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> is working with the military, industry, academia and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dstl-awards-a-new-contract-for-anglo-french-technology-partnership">close international partners</a> to develop a number of concepts and prototypes that can be tested and help the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> make decisions about what future capability is needed. This is one of our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dstl-research-and-funding-priorities#weapons">current priorities for weapons research and funding</a> following the Integrated Review.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Illustration of a high speed missile" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145628/High_speed_weapons_960x640.jpg"></div></figure>

<h2>Modernising systems</h2>

<p>We develop next-generation offensive capability and improved protection for our armed forces, upgrading current technology such as the British Army’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dstl-unveils-requirements-for-future-anti-armour-capabilities-project">anti-armour capabilities</a>, and looking ahead to meet future potential threats.</p>

<p>Working with industry partners, <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> has delivered a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forces.net/news/dstl-unveil-next-generation-fils-assault-rifle" rel="external">next-generation prototype assault rifle</a> with increased range, integrated data and power and a radically improved surveillance and target acquisition system. It’s the first assault rifle that can communicate with other weapons systems and uncrewed aerial vehicles (<abbr title="uncrewed aerial vehicles">UAVs</abbr>). The prototype will continue to be developed, including exploring the idea of integrating artificial intelligence (<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>) to detect targets.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Man kneeling and firing a rifle." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145630/Future_Individual_Lethality_System_FILS_960x640.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>The Future Individual Lethality System (FILS) prototype assault rifle.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> also played an instrumental part throughout the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dstl-plays-pivotal-role-in-defence-missile-development">research and development of the new SPEAR3 surface-attack missile</a>, from piloting new ways of working with industry to the technical assurance of the 7-year £550 million contract. The team provided operational analysis and scientific know-how during assessment and, throughout the weapon development phase, offered assurance that the missile provides adequate lethality whilst minimising collateral damage.</p>

<h2>Communication and co-operation to solve military challenges</h2>

<p>We are investigating how inter-missile communication can be used to enable systems to work together and make missions more likely to succeed.</p>

<p>Introducing co-operative behaviour and sharing information between missiles will improve the performance of current systems. They will be more flexible and able to react to a changing threat or situation as it emerges.</p>

<p>Through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/35-million-investment-for-smarter-missile-systems">Co-operative Strike Weapons Technology Demonstrator (<abbr title="Co-operative Strike Weapons Technology Demonstrator">CSWTD</abbr>)</a>, <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> scientists are working with our industry partner to assess different military tactics and scenarios. We plan to engage further with industry and academia to deliver the foundations for future co-operative missile hardware and software, and help the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> armed forces understand how they can be used in real operational scenarios.</p>

<p>This is a joint piece of work with France’s <abbr title="Direction générale de l'armement">DGA</abbr> through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cwitp.com/index.php" rel="external">Complex Weapons Innovation Technology Partnership (<abbr title="Complex Weapons Innovation Technology Partnership">CWITP</abbr>)</a>, which funds proposals from industry and academia to develop new technologies for generation-after-next guided weapons systems.</p>
