<p>The traditional delivery model of off-the-job training means apprentices attend college or a training provider one day a week and spend four days with the employer.</p>

<p>This is an example of what works well for a lot of employers but is not the only option. For some sectors it can help to adapt how training is delivered to better meet their needs.</p>

<h2>Flexible training</h2>

<p>Sectors which have non typical working patterns, such as shift work, or project-based employment, may need to adapt how or when training is delivered to better meet their needs.</p>

<p>Some employers in these sectors will work with their training providers to agree a different delivery model – such as blocks of training.</p>

<p>Front loaded apprenticeships are an example of this, where a block of training is delivered at the start of the apprenticeship to help the apprentice gain key knowledge and skills early on.</p>

<p>This intensive delivery at the beginning of the apprenticeship can help apprentices get up to speed quickly before they enter the workplace. It is particularly common in sectors such as construction or health and social care, where it is helpful to have covered training on elements such as health and safety.</p>

<p>Front loaded training is also useful for young people brand new to their role, or industry.</p>

<h2>Accelerated Apprenticeships</h2>

<p>It is not only how the training is delivered that is flexible.</p>

<p>Apprentices who have some prior knowledge or skills before starting their apprenticeship can have this recognised as prior learning, meaning training on the elements they are already familiar with can be removed from their training plan and do not need to be repeated.</p>

<p>This means the apprentice should be able to complete their programme quicker, offering benefits to the apprentice and employer.</p>

<p>Where an apprenticeship is reduced in duration, by at least three months or more, this becomes an accelerated apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Those likely to be able to accelerate their apprenticeships include existing employees using apprenticeships to upskill into more senior roles, and those who have completed another related qualification, for example a T-Level or Skills Bootcamp.</p>

<p>This is because they are likely to already have some knowledge and skills relevant to their apprenticeship which can be recognised as prior learning.</p>

<h2>Apprenticeships that work for you</h2>

<p>If you are interested in finding out more about how your apprenticeships can be delivered more flexibly – the first step is to speak to your training provider.</p>

<p>Your training provider will be able to support you with setting up, or adapting, a programme that works for you.</p>

<p>You can also discuss how training is delivered with the apprentice, as part of the initial assessment process, at the beginning of the apprenticeship.</p>
