<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>You should follow the advice of the Hungarian Government and your local authority. You can also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary">Hungary travel advice</a> for our latest guidance.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Hungary see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sign up for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-hungary">email alerts on living in Hungary</a>
</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Attend a citizen outreach meeting</h3>

<p>The British Embassy regularly holds events across Hungary for UK nationals. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/information-and-events-for-british-citizens-in-hungary">Attend one of our citizen outreach meetings</a> to keep up to date on working and living in Hungary.</p>

<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Hungary before 1 January 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>. You must apply for a new residence status by 31 December 2021 to secure your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must carry your ID or passport at all times – a copy of your ID or passport won’t be accepted.</p>

<h3>Residency</h3>

<p>If you were legally resident in Hungary before 1 January 2021, you must <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://enterhungary.gov.hu/eh/">apply for a new Hungarian National Permanent Residence Permit</a>. You need this permit to secure your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>You must submit your application for the new permit by 31 December 2021. You need to apply even if you have an existing residency document. Your family members can also apply if necessary.</p>

<p>Most people will only need to show their current residency document and passport to apply. If you did not get a residency document under the old EU rules, you can show you were in Hungary before 1 January by submitting documents such as a work contract or a house rental agreement.</p>

<p>Until you receive your new National Permanent Residence Permit, your previous residency documents remain valid.</p>

<p>You can find more information about the process on the <a href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1627:information-on-brexit-for-citizens-of-the-united-kingdom-and-their-third-country-national-family-members&amp;lang=en" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Hungarian immigration authority website</a>, known as the National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing.</p>

<p><a href="https://enterhungary.gov.hu/eh/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">You can apply online for the National Permanent Residence Permit through the Enter Hungary portal</a>. As part of the online process, you will be asked to make an in-person appointment within 15 days to submit your biometric data for the new permit.</p>

<p>You may also apply in person at your <a href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">local branch of the National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing</a>.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=1630&amp;Itemid=2062&amp;lang=en">National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing’s guidance on how to apply online</a>.</p>

<p>You can find general background information on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://brexit.kormany.hu/information-for-uk-nationals-and-their-family-members">Hungarian government’s central website</a> about the UK’s departure from the EU.</p>

<p>If you move to a different town in Hungary, you must register your address again at the local Government Office (Kormányablak).</p>

<h3>Moving to Hungary</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Hungary</a> and read the Hungarian government’s guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://konzuliszolgalat.kormany.hu/how-to-apply-for-visa" rel="external">applying for visas</a>.</p>

<p>Read the Hungarian government’s <a href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on residency permits for third country nationals</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Hungary. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Hungary, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Hungary.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Hungary.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Hungary, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Driving in Hungary</h2>

<p>You can use your UK licence for one year from the date you move to Hungary. After one year, you must exchange it for a Hungarian licence. You do not have to take a driving test or exam to exchange your licence.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/driving-licence/driving-licence-renewal-exchange/hungary/index_en.htm" rel="external">driving licence renewal and exchange</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary/safety-and-security">driving rules in Hungary</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When driving, you should always have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your driving licence</li>
  <li>your car papers</li>
  <li>your insurance paper</li>
  <li>your MOT certificate</li>
  <li>your passport or ID and those of your passengers</li>
  <li>a high-visibility jacket</li>
  <li>a red warning triangle</li>
  <li>first aid kit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Hungary</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/hungary/index_en.htm">European Union’s guidance on car registration and taxes in Hungary</a>. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h3>Driving in the UK with a Hungarian licence</h3>

<p>You can use your Hungarian licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test. We will update these pages if there are any changes to the rules, as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must be registered for healthcare as a resident in Hungary and hold a TAJ card. You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.neak.gov.hu/felso_menu/lakossagnak/ellatas_magyarorszagon/jogosultsag_az_ellatasra/ellatasra_jogosultsag_igazolasa/taj_kartya" class="govuk-link">apply for a TAJ card</a> at your local Government Office (Kormányablak).</p>

<p>If you are employed in Hungary, state health insurance is normally arranged through your employer. Insurance contributions will be deducted from your wages. If you’re self-employed, you can arrange to make <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.neak.gov.hu/felso_menu/lakossagnak/ellatas_magyarorszagon/jogosultsag_az_ellatasra/az_egsszsegbiztositas_szolgaltatasaira_jogosultak/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulekfizetes/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulek.html#Ki%20k%C3%B6teles%20eg%C3%A9szs%C3%A9g%C3%BCgyi%20szolg%C3%A1ltat%C3%A1si%20j%C3%A1rul%C3%A9" rel="external">voluntary contributions</a> (in Hungarian) through the National Tax and Customs Administration Office.</p>

<p>If you’re seconded to Hungary by your company, there are special rules regarding health insurance. You should contact your company’s HR department.</p>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-hungary">guidance on healthcare in Hungary</a> and make sure you’re correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Hungary temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-hungary#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Hungary before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same from if you’re either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Hungary and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-hungary#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on using an S1 form in Hungary</a> to ensure you’re correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Hungary, you must not use your UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for healthcare in Hungary.</p>

<p>If you were living in Hungary before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Hungary</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">checking your prescriptions are legal in Hungary</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Working in Hungary</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Hungary before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for a <a href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>If you are planning to come to Hungary to work, you may need a work permit. Read the <a href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=816&amp;lang=en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Hungarian government’s guidance on permits</a>.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Hungary and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country, before 1 January 2021 you may need a permit to prove that you are a frontier worker. You must also apply for the new residency document in Hungary.</p>

<p>If you live in the UK or another EU or EFTA country and regularly commuted to work in Hungary before 1 January 2021 you need a permit. You must apply for the permit by 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="http://bevandorlas.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=1314&amp;Itemid=1853&amp;lang=en" class="govuk-link">National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing guidance for UK nationals</a>, which includes information on the frontier worker permit.</p>

<h2>Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Hungarian nationals, as long as you were legally resident in Hungary before 1 January 2021. You must apply for a residence document in Hungary.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-students-in-the-eu-continuing-your-studies" class="govuk-link">continuing your studies in the EU</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-hungary#studying-in-hungary" class="govuk-link">healthcare for students in Hungary</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to Hungary to study</h3>

<p>If you are planning to study in Hungary, make sure you meet all visa requirements before you arrive. Contact the relevant Higher Education provider in Hungary to check what fees you may have to pay.</p>

<p>For more information read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-european-union-after-brexit">studying in the European Union</a>.</p>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>You may need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in Hungary. When doing this, you will be subject to the third country regulations.</p>

<p>Read the Hungarian government’s <a href="https://brexit.kormany.hu/conditions-of-employment-recognition-of-professional-qualifications" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on how to request recognition of your qualifications</a>.</p>

<p>If your qualification was officially recognised by the relevant regulator in Hungary before 1 January 2021, make sure you understand the terms of your recognition decision by checking with that regulator.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Hungary to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Hungary have not changed following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.</p>

<p>Read guidance on:</p>

<p>In order to pay income tax in Hungary you need to get an income tax card (Adóigazolvány) with your tax number (Adóazonosító) from your local <a href="http://en.nav.gov.hu/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">National Tax and Customs office</a>.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Hungary. Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hungary-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">English-speaking lawyer in Hungary</a>.</p>

<h3>Banking</h3>

<p>Whether UK banks can provide services to customers living in the EEA is a matter of local law and regulation. Your bank or finance provider should contact you if they need to make any changes to your product or the way they provide it. If you have any concerns about whether you might be affected, contact your provider or seek independent financial advice.</p>

<p>Read the Money and Pension Service <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/brexit-banking-insurance-finance" class="govuk-link">guidance on banking, insurance and financial services changes</a> for more information on cross-border banking.</p>

<h3>Declaration of assets</h3>

<p>All residents must declare assets outside Hungary, including bank accounts, securities, rights, insurance, annuities and property. The declaration is separate to the annual tax return, and there are severe penalties and criminal charges for non-compliance.</p>

<h2>Pensions</h2>
