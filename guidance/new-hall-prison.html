<h2>Book and plan your visit to New Hall</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>All visits to New Hall must be booked 48 hours in advance.</p>

<p>To book a visit to someone you must be on their visitor list and have <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-new-hall">the required ID</a>.</p>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit.</p>

<p>There may be a limit to the number of visits a person can have.</p>

<p>If the prisoner is on remand they can have an unlimited number of visits.</p>

<p>If the prisoner has been convicted (they have been sentenced or are awaiting sentencing) they can have 1 visit every 2 weeks and sometimes more depending on what privileges they’ve earned.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact New Hall</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

<h3>Entering New Hall</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>You will need to leave any valuables, including phones and watches, in a locker before entering the visitor area.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at New Hall</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at New Hall.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>
<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>You may not be able to speak with someone at New Hall during their first few days. This is because it can take time to approve who they can be in touch with.</p>

<p>Women have phones in their rooms but they will always need to call you rather than you call them. They can make phone calls between 6am and 10pm.</p>

<p>Prisoners can only phone you if you are named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in New Hall using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at New Hall.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>Include the person’s name and prison number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact New Hall</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Women in New Hall have to apply for approved items to be sent to them. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact New Hall</a> for more information on what is allowed.</p>

<p>Family and friends of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
