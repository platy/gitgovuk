<h2>Book and plan your visit to Kirklevington Grange</h2>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Kirklevington Grange</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Kirklevington Grange.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this and can call until 10pm.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Before you can send any items, the prisoner must apply and get approval. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Kirklevington Grange</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>
