  </li>

<p>If your UK-based family member is your (or an extended family member’s) spouse, civil partner, fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner the relationship must have started before 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>Other family members will be considered where there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h3>If you have a family member from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland</h3>

<p>You might also be eligible for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/family-permit">EU Settlement Scheme Family Permit</a> if you are the family member of someone who is living in the UK with settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme who is from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland.</p>

<p>You can choose which scheme you apply for but please do not apply to both the Ukraine Family Scheme and the EU Settlement Scheme Family Permit.</p>

<p>You must be outside of the UK to apply for an EU Settlement Scheme Family Permit.</p>

<p>Regardless of which scheme you apply to, if you’re eligible you’ll be able to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme once you’re in the UK.</p>

<h2>How long you can stay</h2>

<p>Your can stay in the UK for up to 3 years.</p>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>It is free to apply to the Ukraine Family Scheme.</p>

<p>You do not need to pay the immigration health surcharge or biometric enrolment fee for this scheme.</p>

<h2>Apply from outside the UK</h2>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply.visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/apply-visa-type/ukraine-scheme-ooc" rel="external">apply online</a> for the Ukraine Family Scheme if you are outside the UK.</p>

<p>This application is also an application for a biometric immigration document.</p>

<h3>If you hold a valid Ukrainian international passport or an expired Ukrainian international passport with a formal extension stamp issued by the Ukrainian government</h3>

<p>If you hold a valid Ukrainian international passport or an expired Ukrainian international passport with a formal extension stamp issued by the Ukrainian government, you will need to complete an application online, but you do not need to attend an appointment at a visa application centre (VAC) to give your biometric information.</p>

<h4>Uploading your documents</h4>

<p>You must upload a copy of the photograph page of your valid or expired Ukrainian international passport.</p>

<p>If you are applying with an expired Ukrainian international passport you must upload a copy of the page where the formal extension stamp issued by the Ukrainian government is shown.</p>

<p>If you have them, you should also provide any documents that show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your relationship to your UK-based family member</li>
  <li>you were residing in Ukraine on or immediately before 1 January 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>You can upload your documents using our commercial partner (TLS) document update app. You can download the app from the TLS website when you make your application.</p>

<p>If you need support to upload images of your documents, you can still book an appointment at a VAC.</p>

<h4>Official permission letter</h4>

<p>Once your application has been processed you will receive an official permission letter from UK Visas &amp; Immigration (UKVI) confirming that you can travel to the UK.</p>

<p>The permission letter will allow you to board a plane or other form of transport to the UK.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You should not travel to the UK until you have received an official permission letter.</p>
</div>

<h4>At the UK border</h4>

<p>Border Force, airlines and carriers will be informed that customers with valid Ukrainian passports who have been accepted under the Ukraine Family Scheme will be issued with a letter confirming they have permission to travel to the UK without a UK visa in their passport.</p>

<p>When you arrive in the UK, you will need to show your permission letter to Border Force officers who will endorse your passport with a 6-month entry stamp.</p>

<p>The 6-month entry stamp is evidence of your right to work, study and claim benefits in the UK.</p>

<h4>Extending your stay in the UK</h4>

<p>You will need to submit your biometrics within 6 months of arriving in the UK to extend your stay for up to 3 years and be issued with a biometric residence permit (BRP) as evidence of your immigration status.</p>

<p>You can start the process to provide your biometric information by completing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply.visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/ukraine-scheme" rel="external">online form</a>.</p>

<p>Once we have received your details, we will tell you how to provide your biometric information.</p>

<p>This might be by providing us with a digitised facial image using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-uk-immigration-id-check-app">UK Immigration: ID Check</a> app or by visiting one of our application centres in the UK to provide a facial photograph and your fingerprints.</p>

<p>You do not need to do this as soon as you reach the UK, but you do need to make sure that you have provided your biometrics before the 6 months ends.</p>

<h3>If you do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport</h3>

<p>If you do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport you will need to book and attend an appointment at a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre">visa application centre</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a Ukrainian domestic passport or ID card, you will need to book and attend an appointment at a visa application centre.</p>

<h4>Visa application centres</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You do not need to book an appointment at a VAC to provide your biometric information if you hold a valid Ukrainian international passport.</p>
</div>

<p>You will need to have your photograph and fingerprints taken at a VAC as part of your application. Children under the age of 5 who do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport will not have their fingerprints taken but will still need to book and attend a VAC appointment and have a digital photograph taken.</p>

<h4>Visa application centre availability</h4>

<p>VACs in Ukraine are currently closed. You can apply at a VAC in any country if you are able to travel safely.</p>

<p>There is a temporary VAC for people applying for the Ukraine Family Scheme in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/rze_en/address" rel="external">Rzeszow, Poland</a>. You’ll need to complete your online application and book an appointment before attending the Rzeszow VAC - walk-in appointments are no longer accepted.</p>

<p>VACs are currently operating throughout Europe including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/bud_en/address" rel="external">Budapest, Hungary</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/kiv_en/address" rel="external">Chisinau, Moldova</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/waw_en/address" rel="external">Warsaw, Poland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/bbu_en/address" rel="external">Bucharest, Romania</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/par_en/address" rel="external">Paris, France</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>How long it takes</h3>

<p>You will need to await a decision from UKVI on your application before travelling.</p>

<p>We are prioritising Ukraine Family Scheme applications and aim to make a decision as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>You will be contacted when a decision has been made with more guidance on the travel process.</p>

<p>If you are granted permission under the Ukraine Family Scheme you will receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an official letter of permission (if you hold a valid Ukrainian international passport)</li>
  <li>a visa (if you attended a VAC to give your biometrics)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please do not attend the VAC to collect your visa until you have been contacted.</p>

<h3>Contact UKVI</h3>

<p>You can call the free 24/7 helpline on +44 808 164 8810 if you are outside the UK for help with any questions about the scheme.</p>

<h2>Apply from inside the UK</h2>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply.visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/ukraine-scheme" rel="external">apply online</a> for the Ukraine Family Scheme if you are in the UK.</p>

<p>You will then book and attend an appointment at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ukvcas">UK Visa and Citizenship Application Services (UKVCAS)</a> service point.</p>

<h3>UKVCAS service points</h3>

<p>You will need to give your fingerprints and a photograph (biometric information) at a UKVCAS service point - this is to get a biometric residence permit.</p>

<p>Children under the age of 5 will not have their fingerprints taken but will still need to attend the UKVCAS service point and have a digital photograph taken.</p>

<p>Some services at UKVCAS service points have a fee. You do not need to use these services, such as document scanning, to complete your application and you should not pay for them in advance.</p>

<p>If you need to use of any of these services at a UKVCAS service point during your appointment, you will not need to pay a fee for them.</p>

<h3>How long it takes</h3>
