<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>To apply to the Ukraine Family Scheme you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be applying to join or accompany your UK-based family member</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be Ukrainian, or the family member of a Ukrainian national who is applying to the scheme to join a UK-based immediate family member</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have been living in Ukraine on or immediately before 1 January 2022 (even if you have now left Ukraine)</p>

</ul>

<p>You can apply if you’ve already arrived in the UK and meet the requirements above.</p>

<p>If you’re a Ukrainian national who had temporary permission to stay in the UK on or before 18 March 2022, you can apply to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-stay-in-the-uk-under-the-ukraine-extension-scheme">Ukraine Extension Scheme</a> instead. Your partner and children can also apply if they’re already in the UK as your dependants.</p>

<p>If you previously had permission to stay in the UK but it has expired since 1 January 2022, you’re also eligible to apply to the Ukraine Extension Scheme.</p>

<p>Your application will be subject to security checks.</p>

  <li>
    <p>someone from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland who has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/what-settled-and-presettled-status-means">pre-settled status</a> under the EU Settlement Scheme and started living in the UK before 1 January 2021</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone with refugee status or humanitarian protection in the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your UK-based family member must be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your immediate family member</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your extended family member</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the spouse or civil partner, unmarried partner, child, parent, or fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner of your extended family member</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should provide a copy of an official document that confirms your family relationships if you are able to - for example, a marriage or birth certificate.</p>

<p>You can still apply if you are unable to provide these documents. You should explain why you are unable to provide them when you apply - for example, if you had to leave all your documents behind when you left.</p>

<h3>Immediate family members</h3>

<p>An immediate family member is your or your UK-based family member’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>spouse or civil partner</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unmarried partner (you must have been living together in a relationship for at least 2 years)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>child who is under 18</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>parent (if you are under 18)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extended family members</h3>

<p>An extended family member is your UK-based family member’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>parent (if you are over 18)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>child who is over 18</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grandparent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grandchild or your partner’s grandchild</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>brother or sister</p>

<p>If your UK-based family member is your (or an extended family member’s) spouse, civil partner, fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner, the relationship must have started before 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>Other family members will be considered where there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h3>If you have a family member from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland</h3>

<p>You might also be eligible for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/family-permit">EU Settlement Scheme Family Permit</a> if you are the family member of someone who is living in the UK with settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme who is from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland. You must be outside of the UK to apply for an EU Settlement Scheme Family Permit.</p>

<p>You can choose which application you make but please do not apply to both the Ukraine Family Scheme and for an EU Settlement Scheme Family Permit as it may cause a delay in getting your decision.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you apply for to enter the UK, if you’re eligible you’ll be able to apply to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a> once you’re in the UK.</p>

<h2>How long you can stay</h2>

<p>You can stay in the UK for up to 3 years.</p>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>It is free to apply to the Ukraine Family Scheme.</p>

<p>You do not need to pay the immigration health surcharge   or biometric enrolment fee for this scheme.</p>

<h2>Apply from outside the UK</h2>

<p>You must apply to the Ukraine Family Scheme online if you are outside the UK.</p>

<p><a class="gem-c-button govuk-button govuk-button--start" draggable="false" href="https://apply-to-visit-or-stay-in-the-uk.homeoffice.gov.uk/sort/start/ukraine_scheme_out_uk" role="button"> Start now <svg class="govuk-button__start-icon govuk-!-display-none-print" focusable="false" height="19" viewBox="0 0 33 40" width="17.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h13l20 20-20 20H0l20-20z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></a></p>

<h2>Prove your identity</h2>

<h3>If you have a valid Ukrainian international passport</h3>

<p>You can use the ‘UK Immigration: ID check’ app to prove your identity if you have a valid Ukrainian international passport. You do not need to attend a visa application centre to give your biometric information.</p>

<h3>Using the ‘UK Immigration: ID check’ app</h3>

<p>The ‘UK Immigration: ID check’ app checks your identity and verifies that the passport you’re using belongs to you. You’ll be told when to download the app once you begin your application online at GOV.UK - you can download the app at any time, but it will not work before this point.</p>

<p>You’ll use the app to scan your passport or take a photo if you can’t use the scanner.</p>

<p>There is detailed information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-uk-immigration-id-check-app-for-ukraine-nationals">how to use the app</a> if you need help.</p>

<h3>If you can’t use the app</h3>

<p>If you can’t use the app, you don’t need to attend a visa application centre to give your biometric information. Instead, you must give your biometric information within 6 months of arriving in the UK.</p>

<h3>If you have an expired Ukrainian international passport with a formal extension stamp</h3>

<p>You can’t use the ‘UK Immigration: ID check’ app If your passport has expired even if it has a formal extension stamp issued by the Ukrainian government. You don’t need to attend a visa application centre to give your biometric information. Instead, you must give your biometric information within 6 months of arriving in the UK.</p>

<p>During your application you must upload copies of both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the photograph page of your expired passport</li>
  <li>the page of your expired passport with the formal extension stamp</li>
</ul>

<p>You can upload these documents using our commercial partner document upload app. This will be either TLS or VFS depending on which country you are applying in. You can download the app from the TLS or VFS website when you make your application.</p>

<p>If you need support to upload copies of your documents, you can still book an appointment at a visa application centre.</p>

<h3>If you don’t have a valid Ukrainian international passport, or an expired Ukrainian international passport with a formal extension stamp</h3>

<p>If you do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport, or an expired Ukrainian international passport with a formal extension stamp issued by the Ukrainian government, you will need to book and attend an appointment at a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre">visa application centre</a> (VAC). This also applies to child applicants.</p>

<p>During the online application process, you’ll be asked to upload copies of any identity documents you may have such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Ukrainian national identity card</li>
  <li>a combination of official documents – for example, a photo driving licence and birth certificate</li>
  <li>an emergency certificate issued by a Ukrainian authority since March 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not mandatory to provide these documents, but it may help support your application if you are able to.</p>

<p>You can upload your documents using our commercial partner document upload app. This will be either TLS or VFS depending on which country you are applying in. You can download the app from the TLS or VFS website when you make your application.</p>

<h3>Visa application centres</h3>

<p>You will need to have your photograph and fingerprints taken at a visa application centre (VAC) as part of your application. Children under the age of 5 who do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport will not have their fingerprints taken but will still need to book and attend a VAC appointment and have a digital photograph taken.</p>

<p>VACs in Ukraine are currently closed. You can apply at a VAC in any other country if you are able to travel safely.</p>

<p>There is a temporary VAC for people applying to the Ukraine Family Scheme in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/rze_en/address" rel="external">Rzeszow, Poland</a>. You’ll need to complete your online application and book an appointment before attending the Rzeszow VAC - walk-in appointments are no longer accepted.</p>

<p>VACs are currently operating throughout Europe including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/bud_en/address" rel="external">Budapest, Hungary</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/kiv_en/address" rel="external">Chisinau, Moldova</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/waw_en/address" rel="external">Warsaw, Poland</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/bbu_en/address" rel="external">Bucharest, Romania</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/par_en/address" rel="external">Paris, France</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Provide evidence that you’re eligible for the scheme</h2>

<p>If you have them, you should also provide any documents that show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your relationship to your UK-based family member</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you were residing in Ukraine on or immediately before 1 January 2022</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other evidence requested as part of the application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can upload your documents using our commercial partner document upload app. This will be either TLS or VFS depending on which country you are applying in. You can download the app from the TLS or VFS website when you make your application.</p>

<p>If you need support to upload images of your documents, you can book an appointment at a visa application centre.</p>

<p>You can still apply if you are unable to provide these documents. You should explain why you are unable to provide them when you apply - for example, if you had to leave all your documents behind when you left.</p>

<h2>After you’ve applied</h2>

<p>You will need to await a decision from UK Visas and Immigration on your application before travelling to the UK.</p>

<p>If you attended a visa application centre, you will need to return to collect your visa before you travel to the UK.</p>

<p>We are prioritising Ukraine Family Scheme applications and aim to make a decision as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>You will be contacted when a decision has been made with more guidance on the travel process.</p>

<p>Your decision letter will tell you if you need to collect a biometric residence permit when you arrive in the UK, or if you need to give your biometric information first.</p>

<h3>If you attended a visa application centre as part of your application</h3>

<p>Once your application has been processed, you’ll be given a visa.</p>

<p>This visa will allow you to board a plane or other form of transport to the UK.</p>

<p>Do not go to the visa application centre to collect your visa until you have been contacted.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to pick up your biometric residence permit once you’re in the UK. Your biometric residence permit can be used to confirm your status and rights in the UK.</p>

<h3>If you did not attend a visa application centre as part of your application</h3>

<p>Once your application has been processed you will receive an official permission letter from UK Visas &amp; Immigration confirming that you can travel to the UK.</p>

<p>The permission letter will allow you to board a plane or other form of transport to the UK.</p>

<p>You should not travel to the UK until you have received an official permission letter.</p>

<p>If you applied using the ‘UK Immigration: ID check’ app, you’ll be able to pick up your biometric residence permit once you’re in the UK.</p>

<p>If you didn’t use the ‘UK Immigration: ID check’ app you’ll need to submit your biometrics within 6 months of arriving in the UK to extend your stay for up to 3 years and be given a biometric residence permit. You will be told how to do this in your decision letter.</p>

<h2>Extending your stay in the UK</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You do not need to apply to extend your visa if you were able to use the ‘UK immigration: ID check’ app or if you attended a visa application centre as part of your application to come to the UK</p>
</div>

<p>You need to apply to give your biometrics within 6 months of arriving in the UK if you received a stamp in your passport when you entered the UK.</p>

<p>You will then be able to stay in the UK for up to 3 years.</p>

<p>You do not need to do this as soon as you reach the UK, but you do need to make sure that you have applied to give your biometrics before the 6 months ends. You will be told how to do this in your decision letter.</p>

<h3>Apply to extend your stay in the UK</h3>

<p>You can start the application to give your biometrics by completing the&nbsp;online form.</p>

<p><a class="gem-c-button govuk-button govuk-button--start" draggable="false" href="https://apply.visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/ukraine-scheme-brp" role="button"> Start now <svg class="govuk-button__start-icon govuk-!-display-none-print" focusable="false" height="19" viewBox="0 0 33 40" width="17.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h13l20 20-20 20H0l20-20z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></a></p>

<p>You will then book and attend an appointment at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ukvcas">UK Visa and Citizenship Application Services (UKVCAS)</a> service point.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to pick up your biometric residence permit once this process is complete.</p>

<h3>UK Visa and Citizenship Application Service (UKVCAS) service points</h3>

<p>You will need to give your fingerprints and a photograph (biometric information) at a UKVCAS service point - this is to get a biometric residence permit.</p>

<p>Children under the age of 5 will not have their fingerprints taken but will still need to attend the UKVCAS service point and have a digital photograph taken.</p>

<p>Some services at UKVCAS service points have a fee. You do not need to use these services, such as document scanning, to complete your application.</p>

<p>If you want to use of any of these services at a UKVCAS service point during your appointment, you will not need to pay a fee for them and you should not pay for them in advance.</p>

<h2>Apply from inside the UK</h2>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply.visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/ukraine-scheme" rel="external">apply online</a> to the Ukraine Family Scheme if you are in the UK.</p>

<p>You will then book and attend an appointment at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ukvcas">UK Visa and Citizenship Application Services (UKVCAS)</a> service point.</p>
