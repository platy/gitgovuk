<p>Safety and security information must be provided for all export movements out of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), unless they are going to Northern Ireland or are otherwise exempt.</p>

<p>There is a requirement to submit export information for some movements out of Northern Ireland, unless they are going to the EU.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-qualifying-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-the-rest-of-the-uk">moving qualifying goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>An exit summary declaration is not a common requirement because most goods being exported will be covered by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-full-export-declaration">making a full export declaration</a>, which includes safety and security data.</p>

<p>Exit summary declarations are submitted through the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system or the Customs Declaration Service, in the same way as export declarations for goods exported from Great Britain.</p>

<p>For goods exported from Northern Ireland, declarations are submitted on the Customs Declaration Service.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>When moving goods to and from countries outside the UK, you should check the customs requirements and safety and security procedures with the relevant customs authorities of that country.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who must submit</h2>

<p>The operator of the active means of transport, (for example, the vessel, aircraft, train or road vehicle) has the legal responsibility to make sure the UK customs authority is provided with pre-departure safety and security information. This could be a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>haulier for accompanied movements</li>
  <li>carrier for unaccompanied movements</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to use a customs intermediary to fill this requirement on your behalf.</p>

<h2>When an exit summary declaration is required</h2>

<p>An exit summary declaration is required when goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have remained in temporary storage for more than 14 days</li>
  <li>have remained in temporary storage for less than 14 days, but the import safety and security declaration details are unknown, or the destination or consignee has changed</li>
  <li>are moved under transit and there is no full export declaration, using either a:
    <ul>
      <li>transit accompanying document (<abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr>)</li>
      <li>transit security accompanying document (<abbr title="transit security accompanying document">TSAD</abbr>)</li>
      <li>transports internationaux routiers (<abbr title="transports internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr>) carnet document</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>When an exit summary declaration is not required</h3>

<p>You do not need to submit safety and security export declarations for goods moving:</p>

<ul>
  <li>from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>under common transit procedures from Great Britain to the Republic of Ireland, where the goods are destined for Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>Some exports do not need a declaration, including those that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>empty pallets, containers or vehicles, including those moved under a transport contract</li>
  <li>outbound inter-port transhipments, meaning goods that are transhipped and then leave through a different port, provided they are put into transit within 14 days of arrival and are moved under a single transport contract — the import safety and security declaration, or entry summary (ENS) declaration, must still be available and accurate</li>
  <li>electrical energy</li>
  <li>goods leaving by pipeline</li>
  <li>goods contained in a travellers’ personal baggage</li>
  <li>goods covered by ATA or CPD carnets</li>
</ul>

<p>A transport contract, or contract of carriage (such as a&nbsp;<abbr title="Convention relative au contrat de transport international de marchandises par route">CMR</abbr>, bill of lading or air waybill) is an agreement between a&nbsp;carrier and shipper of the consignment, setting out each party’s duties and rights.</p>

<p>You must have an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori">Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number</a>.</p>

<h2>When to submit</h2>

<p>You or your representative must submit your exit summary declaration and obtain clearance from customs in advance, before you are allowed to leave Great Britain.</p>

<p>The way goods are transported affects how far in advance the safety and security information must be provided before leaving UK customs control.</p>

</table>

<p>Due to commercial practicalities, you may be required to present your goods to customs earlier.</p>

<p>You can amend safety and security declarations after the initial submission if certain information changes (such as the ferry company used or time of arrival), up until the point of customs clearance.</p>

<h2>How to submit</h2>

<h3>Insert exit summary declarations</h3>

<p>If using <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, submit using the insert exit summary (IEXS) declaration type when you are exporting from Great Britain, by any mode of transport:</p>

<ul>
  <li>through an inventory linked location</li>
  <li>other than roll on roll off (<abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr>), through a non-inventory linked location</li>
</ul>

<p>To submit an exit summary declaration in the&nbsp;<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>&nbsp;system, you’ll need to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transaction code ‘IEXS’</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr>&nbsp;10 00 046</li>
</ul>

<p>If using the Customs Declaration Service, you’ll need to submit a C21e dataset on the system. The procedure code is split into 2 data elements (<abbr title="data element">DE</abbr>) in the Customs Declaration Service, these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="data element">DE</abbr>&nbsp;1/10</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="data element">DE</abbr>&nbsp;1/11</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several 1/10 codes that can be used dependant on the procedure being used. You should use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0012 for export of union goods</li>
  <li>0014 for re-export of non-union goods</li>
  <li>0017 for movements of goods from the UK to another Member State or territory</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="data element">DE</abbr>&nbsp;1/11 code is ‘17X’ for safety and security declarations.</p>

<p>You must read the inventory tariff to make sure that the correct codes are being applied in the declarations. The dataset for a safety and security declaration must include all data elements where note 56 is specified in the C21e dataset.</p>

<p>You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-trade-tariff-volume-3-for-cds--2">UK Trade Tariff: volume 3 for <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr></a> about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-23-exports-declaration-category-data-sets">C21e dataset available in Appendix 23c</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-inventory-exports-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes"><abbr title="data element">DE</abbr> 1/10 information available in Appendix 1B</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds"><abbr title="data element">DE</abbr> 1/11 ‘17X’ information available in Appendix 2</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>‘Arrived’ exit summary declarations</h3>

<p>Submit an ‘arrived’ exit summary declaration using the Export Full Declaration type in&nbsp;<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>&nbsp;if you are exporting from Great Britain to the EU or countries outside the EU by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr>&nbsp;through a port which is not inventory linked</li>
  <li>any mode of transport through Dover, Holyhead or Eurotunnel</li>
</ul>

<p>Some locations do not have the physical space for customs checks to be carried out and are operating with inland border facilities. For these locations, an ‘arrived’ exit summary declaration is needed.</p>

<p>An ‘arrived’ declaration is processed instantly, and you will be told of the outcome.</p>

<p>The shipment should not be moved to the border location until permission to progress is received or you are asked to do so.</p>

<p>To submit an ‘arrived’ exit summary declaration in the&nbsp;<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>&nbsp;system, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the Export Full Declaration (EFD)</li>
  <li>enter the&nbsp;<abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr>&nbsp;10 00 056</li>
  <li>declare declaration type (Box 1) as ‘EXA’</li>
</ul>

<h2>After you’ve submitted</h2>

<h3>Insert exit summary declarations</h3>

<p>Once your exit summary declaration is accepted, you’ll be issued with a movement reference number and a&nbsp;<abbr title="declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr>&nbsp;(if you have not created one yourself).</p>

<p>If you are departing through a location which has chosen to use the Goods Vehicle Movement Service, you may choose to include the exit summary declaration&nbsp;<abbr title="declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr>&nbsp;in your goods movement reference. This is an optional extra step and there will be no consequences for any vehicles moving without this.</p>

<p>The exit summary declaration will need to be presented to the customs office of export in the UK and gain permission to progress before the goods can leave the UK.</p>

<p>All export declarations must be ‘arrived’ in the UK on&nbsp;<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>&nbsp;or the Customs Declaration Service.</p>

<p>Input of the electronic arrival message completes presentation of the shipment so that they may be cleared for the export procedure.</p>

<p>Shipments must not depart, or be loaded to depart, without permission to progress granted from customs.</p>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-arrival-and-departure-messages-are-correct">how to complete export arrival messages</a>.</p>

<h3>‘Arrived’ exit summary declarations</h3>

<p>Once your exit summary declaration is accepted, you’ll be issued with a movement reference number and a&nbsp;<abbr title="declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr>&nbsp;(if you have not created one yourself).</p>

<p>If you are departing through a location which has chosen to use the Goods Vehicle Movement Service, you may choose to include any safety and security declaration reference numbers in your goods movement reference. This is an optional extra step and there will be no consequences for any vehicles moving without this.</p>

<p>The declarant will be notified by&nbsp;<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>&nbsp;if permission to progress has been given or if further checks are required. You should not move to the border location until permission to progress is received, or you are asked to do so.</p>

<p>Once permission to progress has been received, you may proceed to the port of exit and the goods may be shipped.</p>

<p>All exit summary declarations will automatically be assumed as departed on&nbsp;<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, so there is no need to submit the departure notification for exit summary declarations.</p>
