<h2>Forthcoming scheduled closures</h2>

<h3>Planned tests of the Thames Barrier 2022</h3>

<p>The Barrier is operated once a month for maintenance and test purposes. Details of the next planned closures are listed below.</p>

<p>Please note these times may change as a result of a particular experiment or test that engineers need to carry out or because of the weather. The closure and reopening of the gates may start up to an hour before the listed times. Occasionally closures may be cancelled at short notice due to the Thames Barrier being closed in that month for flood defence purposes or navigational reasons. If you plan to come and watch a test closure, please call us the day before to check it is going ahead.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thursday 19 May 2022, 09:40am to 12:10pm</li>
  <li>Thursday 16 June 2022, 08:55am to 11:25am</li>
  <li>Monday 18 July 2022, 11am to 1:30pm</li>
  <li>Monday 15 August 2022, 10:10am to 12:40pm</li>
  <li>Saturday 24 September 09:45am to Sunday 01:45am*</li>
</ul>

<p>*Annual closure</p>

<p>For further information please call us on 0208 305 4161 or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:thamesbarrierenquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk">thamesbarrierenquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Forecasting closures</h2>

<p>The Environment Agency receives information on potential tidal surges from weather satellites, oil rigs, weather ships and coastal stations. They can forecast dangerous conditions up to 36 hours in advance. The barrier will close just after low tide, or about 4 hours before the peak of the incoming tide surge reaches the barrier.</p>

<p>Information comes from a range of mathematical computer models that forecast expected sea and river levels. This is supplemented by data from the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/" rel="external">Met Office</a> and real-time information provided by the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ntslf.org/data/uk-network-real-time" rel="external">UK National Tidegauge Network</a>. This hydrological and meteorological data is fed into the control room every minute from a wide network of tide and river pressure and wind gauges.</p>

<p>The decision to close, or not, is based on a combination of 3 major factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the height of the tide (usually a spring tide) measured at the Thames Estuary</li>
  <li>the height of the tidal surge, which naturally accompanies each tide</li>
  <li>the river flow entering the tidal Thames, measured as it passes over Teddington Weir</li>
</ul>

<p>Find up to date data for river and sea levels at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/station/7386" rel="external">Thames Estuary</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/station/7268?direction=d" rel="external">Teddington Weir</a>.</p>

<p>The barrier has no individual trigger level for closure. The closing process is guided by a mathematical matrix that considers the river flow, tide and surge at the time. The final decision for closure lies with the Thames Barrier Duty Controller.</p>

<h2>How the Thames Barrier works</h2>

<p>The Thames Barrier spans 520 metres across the River Thames near Woolwich, and it protects 125 square kilometres of central London from flooding caused by tidal surges. It has 10 steel gates that can be raised into position across the River Thames. When raised, the main gates stand as high as a 5 storey building and as wide as the opening of Tower Bridge. Each main gate weighs 3,300 tonnes.</p>

<p>The barrier is closed under storm surge conditions to protect London from flooding from the sea. It may also be closed during periods of high flow over Teddington Weir to reduce the risk of river flooding in some areas of west London including Richmond and Twickenham.</p>

<p>The Thames Barrier will then remain closed over high water until the water level downstream of the Thames Barrier has reduced to the same level as upstream. This is a managed process to provide for different circumstances, and takes about 5 hours. The Thames Barrier is then opened, allowing the water upstream to flow out to sea with the outward bound tide.</p>

<p>You can watch a video that shows how the Thames Barrier works:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp4Y1HrRBD0&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="external">a video of how the Thames Barrier works</a></p>

<h2>Thames Barrier closures</h2>

<p>The Thames Barrier has been closed 205 times since it became operational in 1982 (correct as of February 2022). Of these closures, 114 were to protect against tidal flooding and 91 were to protect against combined tidal/fluvial flooding.</p>

<h2>The future of the Thames Barrier</h2>

<p>The Thames Estuary 2100 plan sets out how flood risk will be managed in the Thames estuary to the end of the century and beyond. It also recommends what actions the Environment Agency and others will need to take in the short term (the next 25 years), medium term (the following 15 years) and long term (to the end of the century).</p>

<p>The plan is based on current guidance on climate change, but is adaptable to changes in predictions for sea level rise and climate change over the century.</p>
