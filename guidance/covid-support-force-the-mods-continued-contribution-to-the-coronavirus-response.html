<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3>COVID Support Force</h3>

<p>Since 18 March 2020, the MOD has responded to 399 COVID-19 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://medium.com/voices-of-the-armed-forces/military-aid-to-civil-authorities-maca-a-force-for-good-31ddb1cc1aca" rel="external">Military Aid to Civilian Authority (MACA)</a> requests. You can see the story so far, including what activities the military have undertaken on the previous <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-support-force-the-mods-contribution-to-the-coronavirus-response" class="govuk-link">COVID Support Force page</a>.</p>

<p>As of 21 May 2021, there were around 405 military personnel committed to assist with 19 open COVID-19 MACA requests. This number is kept under constant review and military personnel will be available to support where needed. There are around 5,000 personnel on standby who can be called upon for COVID-19 tasks.</p>
</div>

<h2>Vaccine Support</h2>

<p>Defence have and continue to support efforts to vaccinate people across the UK. Defence have deployed 12 military planners to assist <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England’s Vaccine Task Force based in Skipton House and previously stood up 42 teams of 6 people in England as part of the Vaccine Quick Reaction Force.</p>

<p>Earlier this year in Wales, around 190 service personnel supported Wales’ Health Boards to establish and operate vaccination centres and in Scotland, 90 medics and management staff supported the vaccine programme including 24 logistic support staff, mainly from the Edinburgh-based 3rd Battalion The Rifles who assisted health boards run vaccination centres in Grampian, Dumfries and Galloway, Borders and Lothian.</p>

<p>Since April, 100 defence medics have been supporting Department of Health Northern Ireland with the vaccine rollout. Defence have also helped to deliver thousands of vaccine doses to overseas territories, including to Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands and Ascension Island.</p>

<h2>Support to hospitals</h2>

<p>Hundreds of defence medics deployed to hospitals across the UK to work in intensive care units and other patient facing roles, providing vital care alongside health professionals, to help relieve pressure on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Services. The defence medics joined the 1,600 personnel embedded within the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> on a long term basis.</p>

<p>In addition, thousands of general duties personnel supported in non-clinical roles, including porter duties, to help free up <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff for clinical roles.</p>

<h2>Assisting with the National Testing Effort</h2>

<p>The UK Armed Forces have been supported the government’s efforts to increase national testing capacity and support local authorities to get tests to those who need them. Defence have supported testing programmes in Birmingham, Nottingham, Merthyr Tydfil, Liverpool, Kent, Manchester and in Scotland.</p>

<p>75 military personnel are currently deployed to support community testing in Bolton.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Armed Forces personnel deployed in Derbyshire are assisting with community testing. " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/112563/Pic_3.png"></div>

<p>The military also supported the Department for Education to roll out testing to schools and colleges in England in January. The majority of personnel were in local response teams, providing virtual support and phone advice to institutions needing guidance on the testing process. Teams were also on standby to deploy at short notice to provide in-person support.</p>

<p>Our scientists based at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) have been supporting and working with Public Health England to increase testing capacity nationwide, up to 7000 tests per day can be processed at the Porton Down site.</p>

<h2>Other support</h2>

<p>Military personnel supported ambulance trusts including Welsh Ambulance Service <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust, with 94 medics and drivers. In the North West, around 120 personnel supported the North West Ambulance Service across Liverpool, Greater Manchester, Cumbria and Lancashire and around 90 Armed Forces personnel supported the South East Coast Ambulance Service and the East of England Ambulance Service Trust.</p>
