<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3>COVID Support Force</h3>

<p>Since 18 March 2020, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has responded to 300 COVID-19 <a href="https://medium.com/voices-of-the-armed-forces/military-aid-to-civil-authorities-maca-a-force-for-good-31ddb1cc1aca" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Military Aid to Civilian Authority (<abbr title="Military Aid to Civilian Authority">MACA</abbr>)</a> requests. You can see the story so far, including what activities the military have undertaken on the previous <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-support-force-the-mods-contribution-to-the-coronavirus-response">COVID Support Force page</a>.</p>

<p>As of 22 January 2021, there were around 5,000 military personnel committed to assist with 66 open COVID-19 <abbr title="Military Aid to Civilian Authority">MACA</abbr> requests. This number is kept under constant review and military personnel will be available to support where needed. There are also around 14,000 personnel on standby as part of the Winter Preparedness Package who can be called upon for COVID-19 tasks.</p>
</div>

<h2>Vaccine Support</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> is well prepared to deliver the vaccine and keep pace with supplies as they increase over the coming weeks. Defence are supporting <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> efforts to vaccinate all priority groups and through the <abbr title="Military Aid to Civilian Authority">MACA</abbr> process, Defence has provided 133 personnel into the Vaccine Quick Reaction Force (<abbr title="Quick Reaction Force">QRF</abbr>) to support the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> if requested. The <abbr title="Quick Reaction Force">QRF</abbr> is made up of medically trained personnel who can vaccinate people when needed. Personnel will be engaged only when required and requested by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> in a ‘surge’ capacity. The <abbr title="Quick Reaction Force">QRF</abbr> has 21 teams, 3 for each of the 7 <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> regions. Each region has a Medical Support Officer (<abbr title="Medical Support Officer">MSO</abbr>) to interlink help manage the three teams.</p>

<p>20 of the 21 Vaccine Quick Reaction Force teams have now been deployed in support of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>. These mobile teams have deployed to help administer vaccines wherever requested, including Ashton Gate in Bristol and Southend University in Essex.  The number of teams available to provide short notice vaccine support to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> has now increased to 42 in order to ensure further support can be immediately provided if required by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> as it continues to accelerate the vaccine rollout.</p>

<p>In Wales, more than 90 service personnel are supporting Wales’ Health Boards to establish and operate vaccination centres. For the first time since the vaccine has been rolled out, trained defence medics are supporting the administering of the vaccine. In Scotland, 88 soldiers from the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards are building 80 new vaccine centres for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Scotland.</p>

<p>Additionally, <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> has deployed 28 military planners to assist the Vaccine Task Force in Skipton and a further 200 personnel working across the UK to support organisational and logistical components of the Vaccine Deployment Programme. Defence have also helped to deliver vaccines to overseas territories, including around 10,000 doses to Gibraltar.</p>

"></div>

<h2>Support to hospitals</h2>

<p>Hundreds of defence medics have deployed to hospitals across the UK to work in intensive care units and other patient facing roles, providing vital care alongside <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and Health and Social Care Northern Ireland professionals, to help relieve pressure on <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> colleagues wherever they are needed most. 800 medics will join the 1,600 already embedded within the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, in a number of locations where support has been requested, including 110 defence medics deploying to support the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and over 400 defence medics supporting hospitals in London, the Midlands and South West regions.</p>

<p>Over 600 general duties personnel are supporting these deployments in non-clinical roles including porter duties to help free up more <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff for the front line. The majority of the 800 defence medics are trained as Combat Medical Technicians, who in their day job deploy on overseas operations and exercises as medics, work in defence medical centres and provide medical training to fellow Service Personnel. The standing up of hundreds of defence medics is being achieved without drawing on those personnel who are already working in <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> trusts and with minimal impact to defence activities, including training and supporting the recovery of military personnel.</p>

<h2>Assisting with the National Testing Effort</h2>

<p>The UK Armed Forces have been supporting the government’s efforts to increase national testing capacity and support local authorities to get tests to those who need them. In Birmingham, 110 military personnel worked with Birmingham City Council on a Drop and Collect testing initiative, delivering and picking up tests from homes across the city. In Nottingham, military personnel supported the coordination of a volunteer network who helped to deliver the Drop and Collect self-test initiative.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107376/birmstestpic1.png" alt="Armed Forces assisted in delivering and collecting tests from homes in Birmingham. MOD Crown Copyright."></div>
<figcaption><p>Armed Forces assisted in delivering and collecting tests from homes in Birmingham. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown Copyright.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The military have also supported testing in schools, with over 4,400 tests carried out by 50 military personnel across three schools in October. This was carried out as part of a Public Health England trial to evaluate the effectiveness of rapid antigen tests in a school environment. Around 90 personnel supported testing in 6 schools across the country in December.</p>

<p>Armed Forces personnel are supporting the Department for Education and Department for Health and Social Care to roll out testing to schools and colleges with around 500 personnel supporting this task. The majority of personnel are in local response teams, providing virtual support and phone advice to institutions needing guidance on the testing process and set-up of the testing facilities. Teams are also on standby to deploy at short notice to provide in-person support.</p>

<p>Our scientists based at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">DSTL</abbr>) have been supporting and working with Public Health England to increase testing capacity nationwide. As part of wider testing capability at Porton Down, up to 7000 tests per day can be processed.</p>

<p>In support of Department for Health and Social Care and Liverpool City Council 2,000 specially trained Armed Forces personnel were deployed to Liverpool to operate around 50 asymptomatic testing sites. The military also supported the logistics and planning, and a small team of bio-medical scientists trained civilian personnel to conduct the tests. Around 900 personnel supported testing in the wider Liverpool City region.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/108138/govuk_APOWMID-OFFICIAL-20201105-067-001.jpg" alt="Armed Forces personnel on deployment to Liverpool to test residents and workers.

<p>The military were deployed to support mass testing in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. Around 170 RAF personnel supported Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Wales, Welsh Government and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to deliver mass testing to the town. The personnel helped to run around 14 testing sites around the town and carried out around 11,000 lateral flow tests to help identify asymptomatic cases and break chains of transmission. Military personnel also supported testing in Medway, Kent where 150 personnel helped to operate 5 testing sites.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="RAF personnel deployed to Merthyr Tydfil are supporting whole town testing for all residents, workers and students in the area." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/109732/MT_image.jpg"></div>

<p>Hundreds of military personnel are supporting COVID-19 testing for hauliers in Kent travelling to France. Using Lateral Flow Devices, personnel from 36 Engineer Regiment, 1 Irish Guards, the Royal Welsh, the Welsh Guards and 3rd Battalion Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment supported the Department for Transport and Department for Health and Social Care to help alleviate the backlog of vehicles. Carrying out over 44,000 tests since 23 December, Armed Forces personnel have worked around the clock to keep freight moving. Around 320 personnel remain on task, assisting with testing and supporting traffic management.</p>

<h2>Planning Support for Local Authorities</h2>

<p>The UK Armed Forces have deployed dozens of military planners across the UK. Working with Local Resilience Forums and Partnerships and alongside the Emergency Co-ordination Centres in Scotland and Wales, they are providing additional expert resource to support local communities and businesses and to roll out tracing systems. Military personnel deployed to civil authorities are also helping to free up council resource so Local Authorities can focus on critical areas including enforcing restrictions.</p>

<p>In Liverpool and Halton, 3 Environmental Health Officers (<abbr title="Environmental Health Officers">EHO</abbr>) are supporting the Merseyside Local Resilience Forum and Halton Borough Council. The military <abbr title="Environmental Health Officers">EHO</abbr> are trained extensively in outbreak management and they can interpret the information gathered by the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Track and Trace call handlers to identify and map trends, clusters and sources of infection. This information will then allow Local Authorities to follow up in specific areas and conduct any enforcement that may be required. Military EHOs are also supporting authorities in Greater Manchester and Cumbria.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107413/Planner_image_cropped.jpg" alt="Armed Forces are supporting civil authorities in a range of roles including planning and logistics. MOD Crown Copyright."></div>
<figcaption><p>Armed Forces are supporting civil authorities in a range of roles including planning and logistics. <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Crown Copyright.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>In Lancashire, 6 planners are supporting the Local Resilience Forum, focusing on supporting communities and businesses who are under Tier 3 restrictions, and rolling out the tracing programme. The planners are working with local districts to support vulnerable groups, ensuring robust plans are in place to give people access to vital supplies and medicines. The planners are also working with districts on support to businesses and the rollout of the COVID-19 marshals.</p>

<p>In addition, our scientists, based at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">DSTL</abbr>) have been deployed directly into government departments, local resilience teams and military headquarters, to provide instant assistance, insights and advice to planners and decision makers.</p>

<h2>Other support</h2>

<p>77th Brigade previously support Cabinet Office’s Rapid Response Unit with monitoring and detecting disinformation and misinformation. Instances identified were passed to the Cabinet Office for action. The Brigade is no longer involved in these tasks which came to an end in the summer.</p>

<p>The 77th Brigade are not currently supporting in the Cabinet Office with any projects that would involve interactions with British Citizens who might be posting disinformation nor misinformation and any capabilities are not being directed at the UK population. 77th Brigade do not, and have never, conducted any kind of action against British citizens.</p>

<p>Ninety-four military personnel, including medics and drivers, are embedded with the Welsh Ambulance Service <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust to support them by driving Ambulances as they care for the most vulnerable during the nation’s response to the pandemic. This is the second time the Armed Forces have supported the Trust this year having previously worked with them in April.</p>
