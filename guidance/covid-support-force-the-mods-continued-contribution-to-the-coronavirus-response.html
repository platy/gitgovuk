<h2>Latest News</h2>

<h3>COVID Support Force</h3>

<p>Since 18 March 2020, the MOD has responded to 443 COVID-19 <a href="https://medium.com/voices-of-the-armed-forces/military-aid-to-civil-authorities-maca-a-force-for-good-31ddb1cc1aca" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Military Aid to Civilian Authority (MACA)</a> requests.</p>

<p>As of 17 December 2021, there were around 1,350 military personnel committed to assist with 11 open COVID-19 MACA requests. This number is kept under constant review and military personnel will be available to support on tasks which meet the MACA principles. There are around 7,100 personnel on standby who can be called upon for UK resilience tasks.</p>
</div>

<h2>Vaccine Support</h2>

<p>The Armed Forces continue to support efforts to vaccinate people across the UK. There are currently over 950 personnel available to support the vaccine efforts in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p>Over 650 personnel are supporting <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England with the Covid-19 booster vaccine programme, including 50 planners and over 600 vaccinators available to administer vaccines across the country.</p>

<p>In Scotland, 221 personnel are available to support Scottish Government to accelerate the vaccine programme. 121 personnel have been on task since early October and an extra 100 personnel have been made available this week. 98 personnel are deploying to support all seven Health Boards in Wales to support the Welsh Government to deliver the vaccination rollout.</p>

<p>During the first phases of the vaccine rollout in early 2021, around 200 personnel deployed as vaccinators in Scotland. Defence provided around 190 personnel to support Wales’ Health Boards to establish and operate vaccine centres. Defence medics deployed to Northern Ireland to support the vaccine rollout and <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> also helped to deliver thousands of vaccine doses to overseas territories including Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands, as well as supporting the vaccine programme in England.</p>

<h2>Support to hospitals</h2>

<p>In early 2021, hundreds of defence medics deployed to hospitals across the UK to help relieve pressure on health care services including 115 personnel who deployed to Northern Ireland to support hospitals in Belfast. The defence medics joined the 1,600 personnel embedded within the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> on a long-term basis.</p>

<h2>Assisting with the National Testing Effort</h2>

<p>Armed Forces have supported the UK’s Covid-19 testing efforts including programmes in Birmingham, Nottingham, Merthyr Tydfil, Liverpool, Kent, Manchester and Scotland to help identify and break chains of transmission.</p>

<h2>Other support</h2>

<p>Military personnel continue to assist ambulance trusts including the Scottish Ambulance Service and Welsh Ambulance Service <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust. Defence have previously provided support to ambulance services in England.</p>

<p>129 personnel are currently on task in Wales, driving ambulances under non-blue light conditions. In Scotland, where support to the ambulance service has been extended until the end of March, 96 personnel remain on task.</p>
