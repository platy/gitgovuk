<h3>Entering Aylesbury</h3>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID for all visitors</a>.</p>

<p>Visitors, including children, will walk through a metal detector. You will also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Aylesbury has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes. You cannot wear large coats, gloves or scarves, hooded tops, revealing clothing such as low-cut tops, shorts, or short dresses, offensive slogans, sports team clothing, ripped clothing, watches, or headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons. In addition, you cannot wear flip-flop style shoes (all shoes should have at least an ankle strap).</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Aylesbury. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker (£1 coin refundable) or with security. Pushchairs and car seats must be left in the visitors centre.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<p>The visitors centre is run by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonadvice.org.uk/hmp-yoi-aylesbury" rel="external">Prison Advice and Care Trust (PACT)</a> and is located to the right of the main gate.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<p>Family days are currently available; by invitation only.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Aylesbury</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Aylesbury.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners have phones in their cells to make outgoing calls so they will be able to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Aylesbury using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You can request a reply and attach photos for a small additional fee.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p>Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">how secure video calls work</a></p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number (or date of birth) on the envelope. You must also write your own name and address on the back of the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Aylesbury</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>Clothes for attending court can be sent in without applying in advance. They must be clearly marked as ‘court clothes’ and not contain any other items.</p>

<p>Prisoners on ‘enhanced privileges’ can apply to have one clothing parcel sent to them each year. Prisoners can apply for their parcel in the month before their birthday; all parcels must come direct from the approved suppliers. All unapproved parcels will be returned to the sender at the prisoners expense.</p>

<p>Prisoners can buy items from approved suppliers through a catalogue system.</p>
