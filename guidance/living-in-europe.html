<p>This guidance is for UK nationals who moved to European countries before 1 January 2021.</p>
</div>

<p>This information is a guide only. You should obtain definitive information from authorities in the country where you live. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) is not liable for any inaccuracies in this information.</p>

<p>For general information about living in a European country go to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/overseas-living-in-guides#eu,-eea/efta-countries-and-switzerland">living in guide</a> for the country you live in and sign up for email alerts for that country.</p>

<h2>UK nationals in EU countries</h2>

<h3>Your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement</h3>

<p>If you were lawfully resident in an EU country before 1 January 2021, your rights are protected by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration">Withdrawal Agreement</a>. You continue to have broadly the same rights to live, work, study and access benefits and services as you had before Brexit.</p>

<p>Read:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdrawal-agreement-explainer-for-part-2-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement explainer</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Residence documents and status</h3>

<p>You and your family may need to apply for a new residence status to secure your rights if you were living in an EU country before 1 January 2021. If the country where you live does not require you to apply for a new residence status, you can still request a new residence document if you want one.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members can join you in the country where you are living. This applies to spouses, registered partners or durable partners, dependent children and grandchildren, and dependent parents and grandparents, including those of your spouse or registered partner. Your relationship with them must have begun by 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you have, or if you legally adopt, children in the future, and you have custody of them, your children will have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h3>Passports and travel</h3>

<p>When you travel, especially within the EU, you should carry your residence document or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of status under the Withdrawal Agreement, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, you should carry evidence that you have applied. This could be your certificate of application or certificate of registration.  If you cannot prove that you are a resident, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU.</p>

<p>Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you do not need any extra months on your passport to enter or exit EU countries.</p>

<h3>Healthcare</h3>

<p>You retain your rights to healthcare in the EU country you live in, as long as you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/relations-united-kingdom/eu-uk-withdrawal-agreement/citizens-rights_en" rel="external">remain covered by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.

<h3>Working in Europe</h3>

<p>If you live in an EU or <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> country and were regularly commuting to work in other EU or <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> countries before 1 January 2021, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/frontier-workers-in-eu-and-efta-countries">guidance for frontier workers</a>. </p>

<h3>Studying in the EU</h3>
