<h2>2. Types of insolvency</h2>

<h3>2.1 What is insolvency</h3>

<p>Insolvency occurs when individuals or businesses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not have enough assets to cover their debts</li>
  <li>cannot pay their debts when they become due</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> refers to the official receiver, or to the insolvency practitioner appointed over an insolvent businessâ€™s affairs, as the â€˜office holderâ€™.</p>

<p>Office holders are liable to account for VAT in the normal way following their appointment.</p>

<h3>2.2 What types of insolvency there are</h3>

<p>There are various types of insolvency procedure into which a VAT-registered business may enter.</p>

<p>Insolvencies are defined in law. In this notice we have grouped them into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>formal insolvencies</li>
  <li>business rescue procedures</li>
  <li>those receiverships which we do not treat procedurally as insolvencies</li>
</ul>

<p>When appropriate, the date that establishes our claim in the insolvency (the relevant date) appears after the definition.</p>

<h3>2.3 Formal insolvencies</h3>

<h4>2.3.1 Administrative receivership</h4>

<p>An administrative receiver may be appointed to manage the affairs of a company by a secured creditor who holds a debenture agreement containing floating (or fixed and floating) charges over the whole (or substantially the whole) of a companyâ€™s assets.</p>

<p>Upon the appointment of the administrative receiver, the floating charges will crystallise.</p>

<p>The administrative receiver must treat the business assets covered by the charges in such a way as to recover the money due to the secured creditor. If the administrative receiver deems it to be in the best interests of the secured creditor, the business will continue to trade.</p>

<p>We take the date of the receiverâ€™s appointment as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Bankruptcy</h4>

<p>A bankrupt is an individual against whom the court has made a bankruptcy order.</p>

<p>The court can declare a person bankrupt on petition from the individual, one or more of their creditors, or the supervisor of an individual voluntary arrangement. The order indicates that the person is unable to pay their debts and, subject to certain exceptions, deprives them of their property, which can then be sold in order to pay their creditors.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> takes the date of the bankruptcy order as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 Sequestration</h4>

<p>This is the bankruptcy process of an individual, or partnership (firm) in Scotland.</p>

<p>If the debtor presents the petition for sequestration, then we treat the date on which sequestration is awarded as the relevant date.</p>

<p>The court issues a citation, or warrant, to order the debtor to appear before the court within 14 days to state their case as to why sequestration should not be awarded, if the petition for sequestration is presented by a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creditor</li>
  <li>trustee acting under a trust deed</li>
</ul>

<p>If the debtor fails to appear, sequestration is awarded.</p>

<p>In such cases, we take the date of the original â€˜warrant to citeâ€™ as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.3.4 Creditorsâ€™ voluntary liquidation</h4>

<p>A creditorsâ€™ voluntary liquidation usually relates to an insolvent company and is commenced by a resolution of the shareholders.</p>

<p>A creditorsâ€™ meeting is called so that the creditors of the company may, if they wish, appoint another insolvency practitioner in place of the shareholdersâ€™ appointee.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> takes the date of the extraordinary resolution as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.3.5 Members voluntary liquidation</h4>

<p>The directors of a company, or the majority of its directors, make a declaration of solvency. In the declaration, the directors state their opinion that the company will be able to settle its debts in full, plus interest, within a period not exceeding 12 months of its being placed in liquidation. The declaration must be made within the 5 weeks immediately preceding the date of the passing of the resolution for winding-up.</p>

<p>Liquidation takes place when the resolution is passed.</p>

<p>We take the date of the resolution as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.3.6 Compulsory winding-up</h4>

<p>The court orders a compulsory winding-up as the result of the presentation of a petition by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the company</li>
  <li>its creditors</li>
  <li>its directors</li>
  <li>one or more of its shareholders</li>
  <li>the Secretary of State</li>
</ul>

<p>We take the date of the winding-up order as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.3.7 Partnership winding-up</h4>

<p>The court orders a compulsory winding-up as a result of the presentation of a petition by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the members of the partnership</li>
  <li>a creditor</li>
</ul>

<p>We take the date of the winding-up order as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.3.8 Provisional liquidation</h4>

<p>The court may appoint a provisional liquidator after the presentation of a petition for a winding-up in order to protect the assets of a company before a winding-up order is made.</p>

<p>When a provisional liquidator has been appointed, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> does not treat the case as insolvency until a winding-up order is made and a â€˜permanentâ€™ liquidator appointed.</p>

<p>We take the date of the appointment of the provisional liquidator as the relevant date and issue the insolvency claim to the permanent liquidator.</p>

<h3>2.4 Business rescue procedures</h3>

<h4>2.4.1 Company administration</h4>

<p>The court may appoint an administrator following an application by either the company, its directors or one or more of its creditors. In addition, an administrator may be appointed out of court by the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>company or its directors</li>
  <li>holder of a qualifying floating charge</li>
</ul>

<p>The administrator must perform their functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>firstly, to rescue the company</li>
  <li>secondly, if that is not practicable, to achieve a better result for the companyâ€™s creditors as a whole than would be achieved in a winding-up</li>
  <li>thirdly, if the second option is not practicable, to do their best for the secured and preferential creditors without unnecessarily harming the interests of the creditors as a whole</li>
</ul>

<p>We take the date of the administration order as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.4.2 Partnership administration order</h4>

<p>The court appoints an administrator following an application by the members of the partnership or by a creditor, which is intended to allow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the partnership, or part of it, to survive in a restructured form</li>
  <li>for the approval of a partnership voluntary arrangement</li>
  <li>for a better realisation of the companyâ€™s assets than would be obtained from winding-up the partnership</li>
</ul>

<p>We take the date of the partnership administration order as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.4.3 County court administration order</h4>

<p>The court:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes an order for regular payments to be made over a period of time in settlement of debts</li>
  <li>administers the scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme is only available to individuals.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> takes the date of the administration order as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.4.4 Deceased personsâ€™ administration order</h4>

<p>An order made for the administration of a deceased personâ€™s estate.</p>

<p>We take the date of the administration order as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.4.5 Deed of arrangement</h4>

<p>This is a method by which an individual can arrange terms with creditors.</p>

<p>We take the date of execution of the deed as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.4.6 Scheme of arrangement</h4>

<p>A term normally used to describe a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or members or any class of them, which may involve a scheme for the reconstruction of the company.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> takes the date of the creditorsâ€™ meeting confirmed by the court order as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.4.7 Scottish trust deeds</h4>

<p>A debtor grants a deed in favour of the trustee that transfers their assets to the trustee for the benefit of creditors.</p>

<p>We take the date the deed is signed as the relevant date.</p>

<h4>2.4.8 Voluntary arrangements</h4>

<p>A voluntary arrangement provides an alternative to bankruptcy or liquidation without the attached restrictions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The debtor makes proposals through a licensed insolvency practitioner, which are presented to a meeting of creditors. Creditors must be given 14 clear days notice of such a meeting. The proposals will usually entail delayed or reduced payment of debts, and should be advantageous to both the debtor and the creditors.</li>
  <li>A supervisor will be appointed to monitor the arrangement for its duration. The trader usually continues to be responsible for the business activities unless, in the case of a company, the proposal provided for either an administrator or liquidator to continue trading the company for some or all of the arrangementâ€™s duration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Company and partnership voluntary arrangements are similar. A moratorium may be sought preventing certain recovery actions in order to grant a breathing space for the business.</p>

<p>We take the date of the creditorsâ€™ meeting when the voluntary arrangement was approved as the relevant date.</p>

<h3>2.5 Procedures not treated as insolvencies</h3>

<h4>2.5.1 Agricultural charge receivership</h4>

<p>A secured creditor can appoint a receiver under the Agricultural Credits Act 1928 over the assets of a farm estate.</p>

<h4>2.5.2 Fixed charge receivership</h4>

<p>A receiver, or receiver and manager, is appointed by a secured creditor who holds a fixed charge over the specific assets of a business. The assets will be used for the benefit of the secured creditor.</p>

<h4>2.5.3 Law of Property Act receivership</h4>

<p>A lender, such as a bank, can appoint a receiver over a mortgaged property under the Law of Property Act 1925 to recover money advanced.</p>

<p>The receiver will usually try to arrange for the property to be sold or will be responsible for collecting rents for the mortgagee. The business may continue to trade independently of the receiverâ€™s appointment.</p>

<h4>2.5.4 Court appointed receivership</h4>

<p>The court is able to appoint a receiver to collect property over which they are appointed. No property is invested in such a receiver, but his appointment acts as an injunction restraining other parties from realising assets, which the receiver has been appointed to receive.</p>

<p>Do not contact the VAT helpline unless you have a general VAT query. You do not need to contact the VAT helpline to notify <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> of these appointments. Law of Property Act or fixed charge receivers who wish to enquire if thereâ€™s an option to tax on a particular property should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-and-option-to-tax">Option to Tax service</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Claims</h2>

<h3>4.1 Calculation of claims</h3>

<p>Once notified that a VAT-registered business has become insolvent, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will calculate our claim based on the amount outstanding at the date on which the business became insolvent. You can obtain a more detailed breakdown of the claim from the issuing office.</p>

<h3>4.2 Relevant date</h3>

<p>The relevant date is the date which establishes our claim in the insolvency. The claim will include VAT up to the day before the relevant date.</p>

<p>When the business continues to trade, the office holder will have responsibility for the VAT affairs of the business from the relevant date onwards. Exceptions to this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bankrupts continuing to trade</li>
  <li>voluntary arrangements</li>
  <li>deeds and schemes of arrangement</li>
  <li>county court administration orders</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.3 Amended claims</h3>

<p>We will issue an amended claim if there are any adjustments made to the insolvent traderâ€™s pre-appointment VAT account which affect our original claim.</p>

<p>The amended claim liability will supersede the original claim notification.</p>

<h3>4.4 Tax assessments</h3>

<p>If a VAT Return has not been submitted for any VAT accounting periods falling prior to the relevant date, the tax liability for the periods may be assessed by means of a computer calculated assessment.</p>

<p>We may withdraw this type of assessment once an acceptable VAT Return has been submitted. If you require a duplicate return you should contact the appropriate <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> insolvency team for the insolvency type concerned using the contact details contained at <a class="govuk-link" href="#further-information-and-advice">paragraph 1.4</a>. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> reserves the right to verify the accuracy of any returns received.</p>

<p>Assessments relate to individual prescribed accounting periods. Theyâ€™re normally issued as the result of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under or over declarations of VAT discovered during an inspection of the VAT records</li>
  <li>the best available means in the absence of records</li>
  <li>a declaration by the trader</li>
</ul>

<p>Each assessment line corrects the liability previously declared or assessed for the relevant accounting period.</p>

<p>Error correction notifications (formerly known as voluntary disclosures) by the registered trader, or by the insolvency practitioner, of amounts which have been under or over declared follow the same pattern.</p>

<p>Subject to time limits <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has the right to assess the tax liability for any period when a return has not been submitted or if thereâ€™s evidence that tax is due.</p>

<h3>4.5 Penalties</h3>

<p>Part of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>â€™s claim may consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>default surcharge</li>
  <li>default interest</li>
  <li>penalty interest</li>
  <li>a civil penalty</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.5.1 Default surcharge</h4>

<p>This is a penalty calculated as a percentage of the VAT due for the tax period covered by the return which remains unpaid by the due date. Surcharge can increase on every subsequent default up to a maximum of 15%.</p>

<p>You can find further information on default surcharge in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70050-default-surcharge">Default surcharge (Notice 700/50)</a>.</p>

<h4>4.5.2 Default interest</h4>

<p>This may be charged on assessments or voluntary disclosures for VAT under declarations or over claims. The interest will be calculated as a percentage of the under declaration or over claim. Itâ€™s charged from the day after the due date of the return which understates the VAT due, to the date the assessment or voluntary disclosure is paid. If VAT is overpaid by us following a repayment claim, interest is charged from 7 days after the date we authorised your repayment, until the date the assessment to recover the over payment is paid.</p>

<p>You can find further information on default interest for VAT in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70043-default-interest">Default interest (Notice 700/43)</a>.</p>

<p>Interest is also chargeable on assessments and voluntary disclosures for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>air passenger duty</li>
  <li>Insurance Premium Tax</li>
  <li>Landfill Tax</li>
  <li>Climate Change Levy</li>
  <li>Aggregates Levy</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.5.3 Civil penalties or criminal penalties</h4>

<p>Civil penalties can be raised for a variety of reasons including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>late notification of a liability to be registered</li>
  <li>inaccuracies on taxpayerâ€™s returns or documents</li>
  <li>breaches of regulations</li>
  <li>dishonesty</li>
</ul>

<p>Criminal penalties can also be raised if a criminal offence is committed. These penalties will be raised by the courts and will not be included in our insolvency claim.</p>

<h3>4.6 Penalty interest</h3>

<p>Penalty interest can also be charged for late payment of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Landfill Tax</li>
  <li>Climate Change Levy</li>
  <li>Aggregates Levy returns</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s also chargeable on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tax or levy assessments</li>
  <li>penalties</li>
  <li>interest</li>
  <li>penalty interest in relation to:
    <ul>
      <li>Landfill Tax</li>
      <li>Climate Change Levy</li>
      <li>Aggregates Levy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>4.7 Proof of debt</h3>

<p>In bankruptcies and compulsory liquidations the office holder can request a proof of debt from the Insolvency Claims Handling Unit. You can find their address in <a class="govuk-link" href="#further-information-and-advice">paragraph 1.4</a>.</p>

<h2>5. Returns</h2>

<h3>5.1 The VAT Return</h3>

<p>The great majority of businesses must file their returns online and pay any VAT due electronically. The only exceptions to this are businesses subject to an insolvency procedure and businesses run by practicing members of a religious society, whose beliefs prevent them from using computers.</p>

<h3>5.2 Pre-insolvency returns</h3>

<p>The insolvent business has responsibility for submitting pre-insolvency returns. But, the office holder may submit a return for any pre-relevant period for which the trader has not rendered a return.</p>

<p>Leave the return unsigned, but add the legend, â€˜completed from the books and records of the company or traderâ€™.</p>

<p>The final pre-insolvency return covering the period up to the relevant date will be issued automatically to the office holder. This return will not be subject to default surcharge.</p>

<h3>5.3 Split period returns</h3>

<p>When the relevant date falls within a prescribed VAT accounting period for which no tax liability has been declared, VAT returns will be issued covering the immediate pre and post appointment accounting periods.</p>

<p>VAT returns issued for the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>outstanding pre-appointment period run from the beginning of the prescribed accounting period to the day immediately prior to the date of appointment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>first post-appointment VAT accounting period run from the date of appointment to the end of the next prescribed accounting period</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>5.4 Post-insolvency returns</h3>

<p>Returns will be issued automatically to the office holder on a monthly or quarterly basis as appropriate.</p>

<p>The office holder has legal responsibility for completing and submitting post-insolvency returns and accounting for any tax due, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>voluntary arrangements</li>
  <li>deeds and schemes of arrangement</li>
  <li>county court administration orders</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.5 Application of penalties</h3>

<h4>5.5.1 Penalties due under VAT Act 1994</h4>

<p>VAT default surcharge, VAT civil penalties and VAT default interest are not normally applied to post-insolvency VAT returns, except in the case of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>administrations</li>
  <li>partnership administration orders</li>
  <li>deceased personsâ€™ administration orders</li>
  <li>deeds and schemes of arrangement</li>
  <li>Scottish trust deeds</li>
  <li>county court administration orders</li>
  <li>voluntary arrangements</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.5.2 Inaccuracy penalties due under Schedule 24 FA 2007</h4>

<p>Inaccuracy penalties due under this act are applied both before and after insolvency VAT returns and relevant documents in all cases. Factsheet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compliance-checks-penalties-for-inaccuracies-in-returns-or-documents-ccfs7a">CC/FS7a</a> provides details of the penalty for the inaccuracies regime.</p>

<h3>5.6 Repayments</h3>

<p>Returns submitted showing a repayment due to the business will be repaid in the name of the insolvent business, care of the office holder.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> should make the repayment within 30 days of receipt of the return, subject to verification of the declaration. Repayments will be delayed if:</p>

<ul>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> may make repayments for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>businesses in voluntary arrangements</li>
  <li>deeds and schemes of arrangement</li>

</ul>

<p>Repayments will be sent to the address of the registered business unless the trader has given written permission for the payment to be sent to the office holder.</p>

<h3>5.7 Repayment supplement</h3>

<p>Repayment supplement is a form of compensation paid in certain circumstances when we do not authorise payment of a legitimate claim within 30 net days of the receipt of the VAT Return.</p>

<p>Normally, the 30 day repayment supplement clock will start on the day that we get a return. However, if we get your return before the end of the accounting period, the clock will not start until the end of the period. This is because youâ€™re not entitled to any input tax claimed on the return until the end of an accounting period.</p>

<p>All VAT repayment claims are subject to potential verification enquiries in order for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to be satisfied of their validity.</p>

<p>In the case of VAT repayment claims for pre-appointment periods, weâ€™ll conduct set-off enquiries to establish if there are any pre-appointment debts owed by the insolvent taxpayer to the Crown against which the VAT repayment claim may be set-off (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#crown-set-off">paragraph 13.1</a> dealing with â€˜Crown set-offâ€™).</p>

<p>The time taken to conduct such enquiries will be in addition to, and not count for the purpose of the 30 day repayment supplement clock. The office holder may still request repayment supplement if they believe there to have been an unreasonable delay in dealing with the VAT repayment claim.</p>

<p>You can find further information about repayment supplement in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70058-treatment-of-vat-repayment-returns-and-supplements">Treatment of VAT repayment returns and VAT repayment supplement (Notice 700/58)</a>.</p>

<h3>5.8 Compliance</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has the right to check the accuracy of all returns submitted and to require that the books and records of the business be made available for inspection. In certain circumstances, when it can be shown that an office holder has consistently not complied with regulations, a report may be made to the appropriate licensing authority.</p>

<h2>6. Cancel your VAT registration</h2>

<h3>6.1 What is VAT registration cancellation</h3>

<p>VAT registration cancellation is the process by which a VAT-registered business is removed from the VAT register and the VAT registration number cancelled.</p>

<h3>6.2 When VAT registration cancellation applies</h3>

<p>A registered person who satisfies <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> that theyâ€™ve ceased to make (or ceased to intend to make) taxable supplies is entitled to cancel their VAT registration from the date they ceased to make (or intend to make) taxable supplies, or from such later date that might be agreed with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Further information about cancelling your VAT registration can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70011-cancelling-your-registration">Cancelling your registration (Notice 700/11)</a>.</p>

<p>â€˜Taxable suppliesâ€™ in this context includes sales of assets. You should therefore not apply to cancel your VAT registration immediately upon your appointment over a business, even if that business has ceased to trade, as the VAT arising from asset sales will still need to be included on a post-appointment VAT Return. The sale of assets must be evidenced by a legally valid VAT invoice and, for a VAT invoice to be legally valid, the business must be VAT registered at the point that the invoice is issued.</p>

<h3>6.3 How to cancel your VAT registration</h3>

<p>You should apply to cancel the VAT registration of the business concerned by completing a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-application-to-cancel-your-vat-registration-vat7">VAT 7</a>. The completed form should be sent to the address shown at the bottom of the form.</p>

<h3>6.4 VAT group registrations</h3>

<p>When a VAT group is being cancelled, forms <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-application-for-vat-group-treatment-vat50">VAT 50</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-application-for-vat-group-treatment-company-details-vat51">VAT 51</a> must be used for this purpose rather than a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-application-to-cancel-your-vat-registration-vat7">VAT 7</a>.</p>

<h3>6.5 Cancel your registration online</h3>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=/business-account/vat/deregister" rel="external">cancel your registration online</a> and make other changes by using the online service provided by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. You can ask an agent to do this for you. As the VAT-registered person, you will still be responsible for the accuracy of the information.</p>

<h3>7.6 Verification of claims</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will select some claims for verification. This may be carried out by the local VAT office that will make arrangements to visit you within 30 working days from the date the VAT 426 processing team receives your claim.

<ul>
  <li>members voluntary liquidations</li>
  <li>administrations</li>

<p>Telephone number: 03000 583 936</p>

<p>The criteria for reclaiming input tax on a form VAT 427 is the same as that for a form VAT 426 as outlined at <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-you-can-and-cannot-claim-on-the-form-VAT-426">paragraph 7.4</a>.</p>

<h3>7.8 Output tax</h3>

<p>VAT on taxable stocks and assets remaining at the date of insolvency must be accounted for on post-appointment returns including the final return form â€” VAT 193.</p>

<p>VAT must not be charged post VAT registration cancellation, since a cancelled VAT registered business cannot legally issue a VAT invoice. The VAT registration will therefore be kept open until all trading has ceased and asset realisation is complete (though insolvent businesses that continue to trade may cancel their VAT registration voluntarily on turnover grounds if they can satisfy the conditions laid out in paragraph 3.2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70011-cancelling-your-registration">Cancelling your registration (Notice 700/11)</a>).</p>

<h2>9. Bankrupt continues to trade</h2>

<h3>9.1 Whoâ€™s responsible</h3>

<p>When trading continues after bankruptcy, the bankrupt retains responsibility for the submission and payment of VAT returns covering post-bankruptcy periods. It is therefore important that the trustee informs the Enforcement and Insolvency Services Newcastle (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#further-information-and-advice">paragraph 1.4</a>) if the bankrupt continues to trade beyond the date of bankruptcy.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will establish the pre-bankruptcy position to allow us to lodge a claim, make a repayment to the office holder, or operate <a class="govuk-link" href="#crown-set-off">Crown set-off</a> as appropriate.</p>

<h3>9.2 Accounting for tax in your period of office</h3>

<p>If you have tax to account for in respect of your period of office, you must not include this tax on the businessâ€™ post-bankruptcy returns. Weâ€™ll issue forms to you on request to allow you to account for the tax. Completed forms should be returned to the Enforcement and Insolvency Services Newcastle.</p>

<h2>10. Bad debt relief</h2>

<h3>10.1 What bad debt relief is</h3>

<p>If you have made supplies of goods or services to a customer and you have not been paid for them, you may be able to claim relief from VAT on the debts you have incurred as long as you can meet all the statutory requirements of the bad debt relief scheme. Youâ€™ll find further information about the scheme in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70018-relief-from-vat-on-bad-debts">Relief from VAT on bad debt (Notice 700/18)</a>.</p>

<h3>10.2 Claiming bad debt relief</h3>

<p>Bad debt relief claims made for insolvent traders can be made on VAT returns in cases when the VAT registration remains open. When the VAT registration has been cancelled, use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-insolvent-traders-claim-for-input-tax-after-deregistration-vat426">form VAT 426</a>.</p>

<p>A letter scheduling the bad debt relief claim details, together with copies of the relevant invoices, must be submitted for approval.</p>

<h4>Extra-statutory concession relieving office holders from input tax clawback provisions</h4>

<p>An extra-statutory concession has applied from 26 November 1996 which relieves office holders or insolvent traders from the need to repay <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> input tax when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supplies were made to the insolvent trader prior to the relevant date</li>
  <li>no payment has been made</li>
  <li>notification that bad debt relief has been claimed by the supplier is received on or after the insolvency date</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. Cash accounting</h2>

<h3>11.1 What cash accounting is</h3>

<p>The Cash Accounting Scheme allows VAT-registered businesses with a turnover limit up to Â£1,350,000, to account for VAT on the basis of payments received and made rather than on tax invoices issued and received.</p>

<p>Details of how the scheme operates can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-731-cash-accounting">Cash accounting (Notice 731)</a>.</p>

<h3>11.2 How insolvency affects cash accounting</h3>

<p>The office holder is responsible for the Cash Accounting Scheme adjustment described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#post-insolvency-cash-accounting-adjustment">paragraph 11.3</a>. The office holder responsible for the business may use the scheme in the post relevant period if the insolvent business was eligible to use the scheme pre-insolvency and continues to be eligible to do so. This may be appropriate in cases when trading has continued after the relevant date.</p>

<h3>11.3 Post-insolvency cash accounting adjustment</h3>

<p>The cash accounting regulations were amended with effect from 3 July 1997.</p>

<p>For insolvencies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>prior to 3 July 1997 â€” The office holder will be required to account for tax on all supplies made or received in the 6 months immediately prior to the relevant date which have not already been accounted for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on or after 3 July 1997 â€” Tax must be accounted for, within 2 months of the relevant date, on all supplies made and received up to the date of the insolvency which has not previously been accounted for.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For businesses in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>administration</li>
  <li>voluntary arrangements</li>
  <li>deeds and schemes of arrangement</li>
  <li>county court administration orders</li>
</ul>

<p>When the relevant date falls:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on or after 1 January 1998 â€” tax must be accounted for on all supplies made and received up to the date of the insolvency</li>
  <li>prior to 1 January 1998 â€” no adjustment at the relevant date is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>This tax should be entered on to the VAT Return for the period immediately preceding the relevant date, and is treated as a liability arising before the insolvency.</p>

<h2>12. Credit notes</h2>

<h3>12.1 Information about credit notes</h3>

<p>General guidance on credit notes can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-700-the-vat-guide">The VAT guide (Notice 700)</a>.</p>

<h3>12.2 Time limit</h3>

<p>When a credit note evidencing a decrease in consideration is received or issued by an office holder after the relevant date, adjustments of VAT resulting from such credit notes will relate to the VAT accounting period in which the decrease in consideration took place.</p>

<h3>12.3 Pre-insolvency supplies</h3>

<p>If you issue a credit note evidencing a decrease in consideration for supplies made in a pre-insolvency VAT period, the effect is to reduce the output tax due in that period and thus to reduce our claim in the insolvency.</p>

<p>If you receive such a credit note which relates to supplies made in a pre-insolvency VAT period, the effect is to reduce the input tax which can be claimed in that period and so to increase our claim in the insolvency.</p>

<p>Since the adjustment of VAT arising from the credit note applies in the VAT accounting period in which the supply increase or decrease in consideration took place, the VAT Return for the period in question will often already have been submitted once the credit note comes to light. In that event, the credit note adjustment should be declared either by letter or by means of a voluntary disclosure to the relevant office. Provide details of the VAT element and the date of the original supply. If you have not yet rendered a VAT Return for the period concerned and youâ€™re intending to do so, the return must include the credit note adjustment.</p>

<h4>12.3.1 Voluntary arrangement</h4>

<p>In the case of a company voluntary arrangement the adjustment should be made on the normal basis, that is, in the period the adjustment takes effect in the business accounts of either the taxable person issuing the credit note or the customer receiving one.</p>

<h4>12.3.2 Scottish trust deeds</h4>

<p>For Scottish trust deeds credit notes should be treated on the normal basis outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#voluntary-arrangement">paragraph 12.3.1</a>.</p>

<h4>12.3.3 Other insolvencies</h4>

<p>Credit notes for all other types of insolvency should be accounted for on the normal basis outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#voluntary-arrangement">paragraph 12.3.1</a>.</p>

<h2>13. Crown set-off</h2>

<h3>13.1 What a Crown set-off is</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is entitled to set-off any pre-insolvency credits against pre-insolvency debt owed by the debtor in respect of other duties administered by us. We can offer any remaining credits arising from insolvent tradersâ€™ VAT repayment claims accruing before the relevant date to other government departments. This will allow other government departments to reduce or satisfy their claims against the same insolvent trader.</p>

<p>The credits may arise from VAT repayment claims, credits for Insurance Premium Tax, Landfill Tax or Air Passenger Duty. Weâ€™ll undertake such set-off whenever it is cost-effective for us to do so, this will usually mean that set-off enquiries will not be initiated for credits below Â£250. The balance of any credit remaining following such set-off will be repaid automatically to the insolvent estate, care of the office holder, or to the trader if the business is in a voluntary arrangement, deed or scheme of arrangement or county court administration order. Crown set-off will take place after either all pre-relevant returns have been received or assessments raised and set-off, or both.</p>

<p>Crown set-off will not apply if the credit is secured by a valid fixed charge on book or other debts.</p>

<h3>13.2 Set-off and preferential debts</h3>

<p>When <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> owes a pre-insolvency credit to a debtor and seeks to set this off against pre-insolvency debts owed by the debtor, which are both preferential and non-preferential (sometimes called â€˜unsecured debtsâ€™), this is undertaken differently depending on the UK jurisdiction of the insolvency.</p>

<p>For insolvencies under the law of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the amount due from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to the debtor must be set-off rateâ€‹ably against the non-preferential debt and the preferential debt, in proportion to the respective amounts of those debts.</p>

<p>In insolvencies under the law of Scotland, set-off operates differently. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will set-off any sums due to the debtor against <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> non-preferential debt first, then any remainder against <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>â€™s preferential debt.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-as-a-preferential-creditor">preferential debts</a>.</p>

<h2>14. Taking Control of Goods or distraint</h2>

<h3>14.1 What Taking Control of Goods or distraint are</h3>

<p>Distraint (attachment in Scotland) is a commonly used method of recovery by taking possession of a debtorâ€™s goods and selling them, usually at public auction, after which the proceeds are set against the debt and costs. Distraint does not require the sanction of a court order. Distraint will no longer be used in England and Wales with effect from 6 April 2014 when the relevant legislation will be repealed but will continue to be used in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Taking Control of Goods (TCoG) replaced distraint in England and Wales from 6 April 2014. Taking Control of Goods is the process under which a debtorâ€™s goods are seized and sold in settlement of outstanding costs, tax and interest. The relevant legislation is in Part 3 (â€˜enforcement by taking control of goodsâ€™) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCEA07) and supporting regulations. This is Ministry of Justice legislation binding on the whole bailiff industry in England and Wales.</p>

<h3>14.2 Bankruptcies and compulsory winding-up</h3>

<p>Once a bankruptcy order or compulsory winding-up order has been made, any incomplete â€˜taking controlâ€™ (England and Wales) distraint (Northern Ireland) action (that is, the goods seized have not been sold), may be completed by us with the authority of the trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator, or the trustee or liquidator may insist on the goods being released to him to sell subject to an undertaking provided by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>If taking control or distraint has been completed by sale within the 3 months immediately preceding the date of a bankruptcy or winding-up order, the proceeds of taking control or distraint may be surrendered to the trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator if the trustee or liquidator is unable to pay the preferential creditors in full from other realisations. The trustee or liquidator must satisfy <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> that such a shortfall regarding preferential creditors exists.</p>

<p>When taking control or distraint is completed by sale more than 3 months before the making of the bankruptcy or winding-up order <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is entitled to retain the sale proceeds.</p>

<p>In Scotland, attachment will not be taken against a sequestrated trader for the duration of the sequestration.</p>

<h3>14.3 Creditorsâ€™ voluntary winding-up, membersâ€™ voluntary winding-up, administrative receivership, voluntary arrangements and company administrations</h3>

<p>If taking control or distraint has been completed (goods in possession of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, either physically or under a Controlled Goods Agreement (England and Wales) or walking possession (Northern Ireland) before the appointment of a liquidator, administrative receiver or administrator, then the distraint or attachment remains valid and will be maintained and may be completed (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sale-of-controlled-distrained-goods">paragraph 14.3.3</a>).</p>

<h4>14.3.1 Voluntary arrangements</h4>

<p>Taking control or distraint action will normally be suspended once an interim order has been made, a moratorium granted or proposals for a voluntary arrangement have been received and a creditors meeting arranged unless there are exceptional circumstances which justify not suspending, for example evidence of fraud or lack of probity.</p>

<p>When a controlled goods agreement or walking possession has been entered into, our support for a proposal is likely to be on terms such that the element of our claim equivalent to either the value of that claim or the agreed valuation of the controlled goods (whichever is lower) shall be a priority claim in the arrangement. When the proposals are rejected at the creditorsâ€™ meeting <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will proceed to complete the seizure by sale.</p>

<h4>14.3.2 Administrations</h4>

<p>Once an administrator has been appointed, taking control or distraint may not be instituted or continued against the company or the property of the company except either with the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consent of the administrator</li>
  <li>leave of the court</li>
</ul>

<p>Although, in view of the special rights taking control or distraint gives us over the seized goods, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will generally try to reach a financial settlement with the administrator without the need to seek court directions. The process of â€˜binding goodsâ€™ under TCEA07 by issuing an enforcement notice considerably strengthens <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>â€™s position in this respect.</p>

<h4>14.3.3 Sale of controlled or distrained goods</h4>

<p>In many cases weâ€™ll agree to the office holder selling the seized goods if it is likely to be to our benefit and, or to the creditors in general. This is subject to the office holder providing us with a written undertaking to remit the proceeds of the sale of the seized goods directly to us.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to remove and sell controlled or distrained goods at any time.</p>

<p>Any money we receive for the sale of controlled or distrained goods will be set against costs and then against the earliest pre-insolvency liability, with our claim amended accordingly.</p>

<h3>14.4 Floating charges</h3>

<p>When a floating charge crystallises on the appointment of an administrative receiver or some other event specified in the debenture, control or distraint will still be maintained and completed if <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has already seized goods which are subject to the floating charge. We may choose to let the administrative receiver sell the goods, subject to an undertaking, and pass the proceeds to us (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sale-of-controlled-distrained-goods">paragraph 14.3.3</a>).</p>

<h2>15. Partial exemption</h2>

<h3>15.1 When is a business partly exempt</h3>

<p>If a business is registered for VAT and incurs input tax relating to exempt supplies, that business is partly exempt. This means that it may not be able to claim all the input tax it incurs and that it will normally have to use a partial exemption method to work out how much input tax can be claimed.</p>

<p>You can find further information about partial exemption and methods of calculation in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-706-partial-exemption">Partial exemption (Notice 706)</a>.</p>

<p>Partial exemption requirements apply to all VAT traders including those which are insolvent or in receivership or administration. As office holder you must comply with these requirements in respect of any returns you complete for pre or post relevant VAT periods.</p>

<p>An insolvent business may seek approval from its local VAT office for a change of method to calculate its entitlement to input tax recovery, given the change in circumstances. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will apply its normal policy, as set out in paragraph 6.11 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-706-partial-exemption">Partial exemption (Notice 706)</a>, to when any new method can apply from with the exception that the method cannot be applied to any pre-insolvency returns.</p>

<h3>15.2 Annual adjustments for insolvent businesses that are partly exempt</h3>

<p>When a business is already partly exempt it may seek approval from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to end its current tax year at the relevant date and to make its annual adjustment in the VAT period ending with the relevant date. Such applications should be clearly marked â€˜VAT partial exemption queryâ€™ and sent to the VAT Written Enquiries Team:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>
 

<br>BT VAT
<br>HM Revenue and Customs
<br>BX9 1WR
<br>United Kingdom
<br>
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> does not allow approval for a change, the annual adjustment is to be made in accordance with the normal rules set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-706-partial-exemption">Partial exemption (Notice 706)</a>.</p>

<h3>15.3 Insolvent traders and the Capital Goods Scheme (<abbr title="Capital Goods Scheme">CGS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If the insolvent business had assets covered by the <abbr title="Capital Goods Scheme">CGS</abbr> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-7062-capital-goods-scheme">Capital Goods Scheme (Notice 706/2)</a>) then those assets pass to the office holder on insolvency. If the use of the assets changes whilst under the office holderâ€™s control then adjustments may arise, which must be declared on returns due from the office holder.</p>

<p>The office holder will need to establish the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what assets covered by the <abbr title="Capital Goods Scheme">CGS</abbr> are held</li>
  <li>when they came into use in the business</li>
  <li>how much input tax was initially incurred and deducted on them</li>
</ul>

<h4>15.3.1 Asset still used within the business</h4>

<p>Any adjustments are likely to be modest as they will only address the time of use by the office holder and the difference between their use and that originally made by the business prior to insolvency.</p>

<p>If the office holder brings the company out of insolvency or sells its assets as a transfer of a business as a going concern then any <abbr title="Capital Goods Scheme">CGS</abbr> items will pass on to the new owners at that point.</p>

<h4>15.3.2 Assets no longer used within the business but held for eventual sale</h4>

<p>If the original use was taxable and the sale will be exempt then there may be substantial adjustments due. As the sale will be made by and under the direction of the office holder adjustments must be declared by them on returns that they submit. If the asset is a building then it may be possible to prevent the sale from being exempt by opting to tax (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-742a-opting-to-tax-land-and-buildings">Opting to tax land and buildings ( Notice 742A)</a>), although this may restrict what buyers may be interested.</p>

<p>If the original use of the assets was partly exempt, and if the sale is to be taxable, then adjustments in the office holderâ€™s favour may arise.</p>

<p>If the business cancels their VAT registration without a sale of the asset taking place then an adjustment may arise at that time.</p>

<h3>15.4 Insolvent tradersâ€™ circumstances which may be affected by partial exemption</h3>

<h4>15.4.1 Insolvent business formerly fully taxable or treated as fully taxable continuing to trade</h4>

<p>When a business remains fully taxable or continues to be treated as fully taxable, the input tax on the office holderâ€™s fees, and all other overheads, will be recoverable. When the business carries on trading and becomes partly exempt, it will have to apply a partial exemption method in the normal way. Recovery of input tax, including that on the office holderâ€™s fees, could be subject to restriction in accordance with the partial exemption method used.</p>

<h4>15.4.2 Insolvent business formerly partly exempt continuing to trade</h4>

<p>When the business remains partly exempt, recovery of input tax, including that on the office holderâ€™s fees, could be subject to restriction in accordance with the partial exemption method in place in the normal way. You should request a change of method from your local VAT office if, due to changing circumstances, the method in place no longer produces a fair and reasonable attribution of input tax to taxable supplies.</p>

<h4>15.4.3 Insolvent business which was fully taxable, or formerly treated as fully taxable, ceases to trade but remains registered pending sale of assets</h4>

<p>When the business has ceased to trade, the principal activity will be the sale of assets. If the assets which are sold are exempt, the business may become partly exempt. Any input tax relating to the sale of the exempt assets would then need to be restricted according to a method. But the office holderâ€™s fees should be treated as an overhead to the business prior to insolvency and, since that was fully taxable, theyâ€™re fully recoverable subject to the separation of any third party costs.</p>

<h4>15.4.4 Insolvent business, which was partly exempt, ceases to trade, but remains registered pending sales of assets</h4>

<p>When the business has ceased to trade, the principal activity will be the sale of assets. Recovery of input tax is subject to restriction in accordance with the partial exemption method which is in place in the normal way. But the office holderâ€™s fees should be treated as an overhead of the business prior to insolvency and, since that was partly exempt, they will be subject to restriction. The business should continue to use the method in place in the normal way. A change of method should be requested from the local VAT office if, in the light of changing circumstances, the method in place no longer produces a fair and reasonable attribution of input tax to taxable supplies.</p>

<h4>15.4.5 Insolvent business that have cancelled their VAT registration</h4>

<p>VAT is only recoverable on services which, although supplied after the registration was cancelled, relate to former taxable supplies made by the business.</p>

<h2>16. Partnerships</h2>

<h3>16.1 How we deal with partnerships</h3>

<p>When a partnership becomes insolvent, we may pursue any of the partners for any liability due.</p>

<h3>16.2 All partners insolvent</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will lodge one claim with the insolvency practitioner in the name of the partnership. This claim should stand in the joint estate and separate estates of all the insolvent partners. We should therefore be included in any dividend declared in any of the insolvent estates.</p>

<h3>16.3 One or more partners remain solvent</h3>

<p>Responsibility for rendering and paying returns remains with the solvent partner(s).</p>

<p>We may lodge a claim with the office holder of the estate of the insolvent partner for any debts accrued up to the date of insolvency.</p>

<p>If you have tax to account for on the administration of the insolvent estate you must not account for it on the solvent partnerâ€™s return. We will issue forms to you on request to allow you to account for the tax direct to us.</p>

<h3>16.4 Partnership wound up but individual partners remain solvent</h3>

<p>The office holder will be treated as the taxable person with effect from the date of the winding-up. They will be responsible for rendering and paying any tax due on returns for the period after the date of winding-up.</p>

<p>A claim will be lodged with the office holder in the name of the insolvent partnership for any liabilities due to us up to the date of winding-up.</p>

<h3>16.5 Insolvent partners with different relevant dates</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will lodge individual claims in the individual estates of the partners calculated from their respective relevant dates.</p>

<h2>17. Law of Property Act</h2>

<h3>17.1 Receivers appointed under the Law of Property Act 1925</h3>

<p>When a receiver is appointed under the Law of Property Act, the receiver is unable to register separately for VAT as theyâ€™re appointed under a legal charge and are deemed to be the agent of the VAT-registered business. This business retains responsibility for its own VAT registration, and all taxable supplies made and expenditure incurred by either it or the receiver must be accounted for on the VAT Return for the businessâ€™ registration.</p>

<h3>17.2 Option to tax</h3>

<p>You should ask the VAT office which controlled the business to confirm if an option to tax has been taken out on the land or building. You will need to supply a valid VAT registration number to obtain this information and if the business has opted to tax, any supplies of the land or building will normally be standard rated. You can find further information in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-742a-opting-to-tax-land-and-buildings">Opting to tax land and buildings(Notice 742A)</a>.</p>

<h3>17.3 Accounting for VAT</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> considers that:</p>

<p>Law of Property Act (LPA) receivers making third party payments to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> in respect of the management of specific properties are discharging their obligations under the Law of Property Act. This obligation is limited to accounting only for the net amount that would be due from the borrower. It is therefore acceptable for receivers to calculate that net amount by reference to any VAT credit that the borrower is entitled to claim in connection with the supply. But as the payment made on account by these receivers is simply made on behalf of a borrower, the borrower is still obliged to submit a VAT Return stating their liability, including the credit for any input tax. In VAT account terms, the borrower must then pay the amount owed, taking into account anything already paid by the receiver.</p>

<p>The Law of Property Act receiver should account for the net tax calculated by means of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-statement-of-vat-on-goods-sold-in-satisfaction-of-a-debt-vat833">form VAT 833</a>.</p>

<p>The Law of Property Act receiverâ€™s duty in relation to VAT is limited to accounting for tax received. It is not part of the receiverâ€™s obligations under the Law of Property Act to obtain repayments of VAT in connection with the property, nor does he have any legal right, under either the Law of Property Act or VAT legislation, to make such a claim. Thus, while <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> accepts that the receiver can reduce the amount of VAT to be accounted for by setting off any VAT credit that the borrower is entitled to claim in respect of that supply, if this results in a repayment claim then it is the responsibility of the borrower to claim on their VAT Return.</p>

<p>If assets are sold, then the VAT due must be accounted for and paid to us using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-statement-of-vat-on-goods-sold-in-satisfaction-of-a-debt-vat833">form VAT 833</a>. The businessâ€™ VAT registration number should be used on sales invoices and quoted on form VAT 833. Payment may be made electronically, with the exception of card payments via online or phone payment service and online direct debit. Use the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>electronic payment to the CITI MISC Account, sort code: 08 32 00, account number: 12000903</li>
  <li>reference to quote CAT2 V833 and then the VAT registration number</li>
</ul>

<p>Law of Property Act receivers cannot make a separate claim for the input tax which should properly be claimed via the traderâ€™s VAT Return.</p>

<h2>18. Transfer of a Business as a Going Concern (<abbr title="Transfer of a Business as a Going Concern">TOGC</abbr>)</h2>

<h3>18.1 The implications of a <abbr title="Transfer of a Business as a Going Concern">TOGC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>There may be a <abbr title="Transfer of a Business as a Going Concern">TOGC</abbr> if the assets of the business are transferred to a different legal entity when they continue to be used in the same type of business as that of the transferor.</p>

<h3>18.2 How office holders may apply for a <abbr title="Transfer of a Business as a Going Concern">TOGC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>An office holder may treat the transfer of the assets of a business as not being a supply when the business is transferred as a going concern and the transfer can meet the criteria set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-7009-transfer-of-business-as-a-going-concern">Transfer of a business as a going concern(Notice 700/9)</a>.</p>

<h2>19. Retention of insolvent traderâ€™s records</h2>

<h3>19.1 How to keep books, papers and records</h3>

<p>The liquidator may destroy the books, papers and records, including the VAT records, of the insolvent company 1 year after the date of dissolution of the company.</p>

<p>A concession has been granted to official receivers to allow them, on request and with our approval, to destroy the books and records of a company after 6 months.</p>

<p>Normal rules for retention of records apply to other insolvencies.</p>

<h2>20. VAT Group registrations</h2>

<h3>20.1 What a VAT group registration is</h3>

<p>A VAT group registration allows 2 or more companies or limited liability partnerships, known as â€˜bodies corporateâ€™, to account for VAT under a single registration number.</p>

<h3>20.2 How VAT group registration works</h3>

<p>The group is registered in the name of the representative member, who is responsible for completing and rendering the single return on behalf of the group. Whilst the representative member is responsible for paying the VAT or receiving any repayment due, all the group members are jointly and severally liable for VAT debts incurred during the period of their membership.</p>

<h3>20.3 The criteria for VAT group membership</h3>

<p>Only corporate bodies established, or with a fixed establishment, in the UK can be members of a VAT group.  Such corporate bodies must also satisfy the control condition.</p>

<h3>20.4 The control condition</h3>

<p>The control condition is that all members of the group are controlled either by one member of the group or a single other â€˜personâ€™ who is not one of the members of the group. That person can be a body corporate, an individual or a partnership. That person is known as the controlling body.</p>

<h3>20.5 Where to find out more about VAT group registrations</h3>

<p>Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-7002-group-and-divisional-registration">Notice 700/2: group and divisional registration</a>.</p>

<h3>20.6 The impact of insolvency on existing VAT groups</h3>

<h4>20.6.1 Insolvency of the controlling body</h4>

<p>When an insolvency practitioner is appointed over the controlling body and the controlling body is a member of the VAT group, they will also assume control of all of the group members within the VAT group. The impact on the VAT group will depend on if the insolvency practitioner decides to retain control over of the group.</p>

<p>In most circumstances, the controlling body is also the representative member and the following principles will apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the insolvency practitioner wishes not to retain control of the group, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will remove the solvent members which then have the option of registering separately or forming another group, as appropriate, leaving only the insolvent members in the group</li>
  <li>the insolvency practitioner can choose to retain control and keep the solvent members within the VAT group, in which case the insolvency practitioner must inform <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> of their decision immediately.  If the insolvency practitioner does choose to keep the solvent members in the VAT group then the post-appointment VAT returns must encompass the whole group</li>
</ul>

<h4>20.6.2 Insolvency of a group member</h4>

<p>If the insolvency practitioner has been appointed over any VAT group member other than the controlling body, it must be removed from the VAT group with effect from the date they are appointed. This is because the insolvent member is now controlled by the insolvency practitioner and not by the controlling body of the group, that is, it no longer meets the criteria for VAT group membership.</p>

<p>If appropriate, the group member should be registered for VAT separately. If the insolvent group member being removed is the representative member, it will be the responsibility of the VAT group to nominate a new representative member and inform <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> accordingly.</p>

<h2>22. Funded pension schemes</h2>

<p>When a company is being wound up, VAT is deductible on supplies under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/23/section/94" rel="external">Section 94 of the VAT Act 1994</a> if the company:</p>

<ul>
  <li>still exists as a legal entity</li>
  <li>is still receiving supplies for which itâ€™s liable for VAT</li>
</ul>

<p>This includes VAT on costs incurred in winding up the companyâ€™s occupational pension scheme.</p>

<p>The company can reclaim the balance of the VAT deductible on these supplies for the relevant period if this is more than the tax the company owes to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> for that period. Claims are made through its insolvency practitioner.</p>
