<h2>Book and plan your visit to Downview</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Downview you must:</p>

<ul>

  <li>book your visit in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-downview">the required ID</a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit.</p>

<p>There may be a limit to the number of visits a person can have. You can check this with Downview.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Downview</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

<p>There is a visitors car park, including spaces for Blue Badge holders.</p>

<h3>Entering Downview</h3>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may be sniffed by a security dog. You will also have to go through a metal scanner unless you have a doctor’s note.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into the prison. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There is a visitors centre run by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonadvice.org.uk/hmp-downview" rel="external">Prison Advice and Care Trust</a> charity. Family and friends can relax, buy refreshments and get advice and support from the staff.</p>

<p>It is open from 12:15pm to 4:30pm on visiting days.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<p>Downview holds regular family days which give prisoners more time to spend with family and loved ones in a relaxed setting. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Downview</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Downview</h2>

<p>You may not be able to speak with someone at Downview during their first few days. This is because it can take time to approve who they can be in touch with.</p>

<p>Women do not have phones in their rooms so they will always need to call you rather than you call them.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Downview using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Downview.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Downview</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>

<p>Prisoners are given a list of approved items that can be sent to them as gifts. These can be ordered online from Amazon or Argos and sent directly to Downview or they can be sent from home.</p>

<p>There are limits on the number of parcels a prisoner can receive, which may vary by prisoner. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Downview</a> for details.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
