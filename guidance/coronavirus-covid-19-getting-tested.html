<p>You can get a swab test to check if you currently have coronavirus. This is part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes">5-pillar strategy for coronavirus testing</a>. Testing is most effective within 3 days of symptoms developing.</p>

<h2>Who can be tested</h2>

<p>Anyone with <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms" rel="external" class="govuk-link">symptoms</a> can get a coronavirus test, whatever their age.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">Get a coronavirus test as soon as you have symptoms</a></p>
</div>

<p>You may be offered a test if you do not have symptoms. For example, if you work in a hospital or care home, if you attend a university or school, or if there is community testing where you live.</p>

<h2>Register a home test kit</h2>

<p>This advice applies to home swab test kits that are sent to a lab for processing (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests).</p>

<p>Once you’ve taken your sample, you must register it via the link below so that we can send your results to you:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/register-home-test">Register a home test kit</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Record a rapid swab test result</h2>

<p>If you had a rapid swab test (lateral flow test), you should get your result within 2 hours.</p>

<h4>You must report a positive result to the NHS.</h4>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">report your result online</a> or by telephone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>England, Wales and Northern Ireland: 119 (free from mobiles and landlines)</li>
  <li>Scotland: 0300 303 2713 (charged at your standard network rate)</li>
</ul>

<p>We also ask that you report negative and invalid results: this helps the NHS to monitor the spread of the virus and support communities across the UK.</p>

<p>You do not need to report the results of tests that are processed at our labs (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests).</p>

<h2>If you are about to go to hospital</h2>

<p>You may need to get tested if you’re due to have surgery or a procedure.</p>

<p>The hospital will arrange this for you. Contact your hospital department if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>Employer referral for essential workers</h2>

<p>Employers can refer essential workers for testing if they are self-isolating because either they or members of their household have coronavirus symptoms.</p>

<p>They can do this by uploading the names and contact details of self-isolating essential workers to the secure employer referral portal.</p>

<p>Referred essential workers will then receive a text message with a unique invitation code to <a rel="external" href="https://test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/register/validate-code" class="govuk-link">book a test for themselves</a> (if symptomatic) or their symptomatic household members at a regional testing site.</p>

<p>To get a login to the employer referral portal, employers of essential workers should email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:portalservicedesk@dhsc.gov.uk">portalservicedesk@dhsc.gov.uk</a> with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>organisation name</li>
  <li>nature of the organisation’s business</li>
  <li>region</li>
  <li>names (where possible) and email addresses of the 2 users who will load essential worker contact details</li>
</ul>

<p>Once employer details have been verified, 2 login credentials will be provided for the employer referral portal.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#essential-workers" class="govuk-link">list of essential workers</a> below.</p>

<h2>The testing process</h2>

<p>The first step of taking a test for coronavirus usually involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves (self-administered) or by someone else (assisted).</p>

<p>The different ways you can get tested are covered below.</p>

<h3>Test sites</h3>

<p>We’ve established a network of drive-through and walk-through test sites for people with coronavirus symptoms. Test sites are open 7 days a week. If you have symptoms you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">book a test at a site near you online</a> or by calling 119.</p>

<p>Around 1 in 3 people with coronavirus do not have any symptoms. There are sites being set up where people without symptoms can take rapid tests. Contact your local council, employer or place of study to find out more.</p>

<h3>Home tests</h3>

<p>Home test kits can be delivered to your door so you can test yourself and your family without leaving your home.</p>

<h3>Home swab test kits that are sent to a lab for processing (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests)</h3>

<p>Most people get their result the next day but it can take up to 3 days. Anyone with symptoms can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a test online</a> or by calling 119.</p>

<p>Watch how to take the test in this video: <a rel="external" href="https://youtu.be/8lo6g-TYZ-c" class="govuk-link">How to take a coronavirus self-test swab</a></p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/testing-for-coronavirus-at-home">instructions on testing for coronavirus at home in accessible formats</a>.</p>

<h3>Rapid tests that give a result within 2 hours (Lateral Flow Antigen Tests)</h3>

<p>You may be given a rapid test kit by your workplace, university or school. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvaBZskxS7tzQYlVg7lwH5uxAD9UrSzGJ" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Watch a video on how to take a rapid test</a>, read the result and report your result online.</p>

<h3>Getting your results</h3>

<p>How and when you get your results depends on the type of coronavirus test you are taking. Follow the instructions that come with your kit carefully to ensure you take the right steps for the kit you’re using.</p>

<h3>Get a test if you’re visiting a care home</h3>

<p>If you’re visiting someone at a care home, you may be offered a rapid coronavirus test when you arrive. The care home you are visiting will provide you with the test kit. The test can tell if you’re infectious or not within 2 hours.</p>

<p>You’ll also be asked to put on protective clothing (PPE) as an additional step to help protect vulnerable residents. The degree of contact you can have with a care home resident will also depend on the care home’s own regulations and on national restrictions.</p>

<p>Watch a video on what to expect when visiting a care home resident: <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_1OMTytQZI">How to prepare for your care home visit</a></p>

<p>See guidance below on <a class="govuk-link" href="#care-home">testing for care home residents and workers</a>.</p>

<h3>Mobile testing units</h3>

<p>Mobile testing units travel around the UK to increase access to coronavirus testing. They respond to need, travelling to test essential workers at sites including care homes, police stations and prisons.</p>

<p>New units are being brought into operation each day.</p>

<h3>Satellite centres</h3>

<p>NHS capability is being increased by providing test kits directly to ‘satellite’ centres at places like hospitals that have a particularly urgent or significant need.</p>

<h3>NHS facilities</h3>

<p>Testing within an NHS facility such as a hospital is available for patients and some NHS workers.</p>

<p>Across all these testing methods, there is a network of couriers who collect the completed samples and deliver them safely to one of our laboratories. The swab samples are analysed at our labs and the result is communicated back to the individual.</p>

<p>We aim to return test results within 48 hours of a swab being taken, or within 72 hours for a home test.</p>

<h2>Care homes</h2>

<h3>England</h3>

<p>In England, all registered adult care homes can apply for coronavirus tests.</p>

<p>You should contact your local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team">health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>)</a> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you suspect your care home has a new coronavirus outbreak (one or more suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19)</li>
  <li>it has been 28 days or longer since your last case and you have new cases</li>
</ul>

<p>Your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will provide advice and arrange the first tests. See a <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949665/Care_Home_Testing_Guidance_visual_v291220-1.pdf">graphic summarising testing for care home staff and residents</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">175KB</span>, <span lang="en" class="page-length">6 pages</span>)</span>.</p>

<p>For testing in other situations, you should apply for testing kits following the instructions below.</p>

<h3>Scotland</h3>

<p>In a care home where there is one or more confirmed case of coronavirus, the local health board must offer testing to all staff and residents regardless of symptoms as part of enhanced outbreak investigations. Testing will be organised by local health board testing teams, using local and NHS Scotland laboratory capacity.</p>

<p>In a care home with no positive cases for 2 weeks or more, the local health board must offer testing to all staff on a weekly basis. Please follow the instructions below to access this routine testing of staff in your care home.</p>

<h3>Wales</h3>

<p>Existing arrangements include testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all residents and staff of care homes with ongoing cases of COVID-19 and any home reporting a new outbreak</li>
  <li>larger care homes registered for 50 or more beds</li>
  <li>all people being discharged from hospital to live in care homes regardless of whether or not they were admitted to hospital with COVID-19</li>
  <li>all people who are being transferred between care homes and for new admissions from the community</li>
</ul>

<p>This policy has been supplemented by a large-scale testing programme covering all residents and staff across care homes in Wales that have not reported an outbreak or any cases of coronavirus in the last 28 days. It’s being followed up through a weekly rolling programme to test care home staff.</p>

<p>Wales’ policy for testing in care homes will continue to be reviewed and adapted as the scientific evidence changes</p>

<h3>Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>A regular programme of COVID-19 testing for all care home residents and staff is in place across Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>All asymptomatic residents will be tested for COVID-19 every 28 days with all asymptomatic staff testing every 14 days.</p>

<p>This applies to all care homes that have no suspected or confirmed outbreak.</p>

<p>If homes have single cases or potential clusters of cases in residents and/or staff, the person in charge of the facility should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>contact the GP of each affected individual case to arrange clinical assessment&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the Public Health Agency (PHA) duty room on 0300 555 0119 or by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pha.dutyroom@hscni.net">pha.dutyroom@hscni.net</a> to complete a clinical risk assessment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to test care home residents and workers</h3>

<p>You can apply for coronavirus testing kits to test the residents and/or staff of your care home. You can apply whether or not any of your residents or staff have coronavirus symptoms.</p>

</div>

<h3>Regular testing in care homes (England)</h3>

<p>On 6 July, we started rolling out regular testing (retesting) for care homes in England. Retesting involves care homes testing staff weekly and residents every 28 days.</p>

<p>Applications for retesting are now open for care homes caring for the over-65s and those with dementia. The remaining adult care homes will be able to register for retesting from 31 August.</p>

<p>Any specialist care homes that have not yet registered for their initial whole care home tests should still apply on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-care-home" class="govuk-link">care home portal</a> to receive their initial whole care home tests.</p>

<p>Care homes will need to re-register on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-care-home" class="govuk-link">care home portal</a> to apply for retesting. Applications for retesting are now open for care homes caring for the over-65s and those with dementia.</p>

<p>See a <span class="attachment-inline"><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949665/Care_Home_Testing_Guidance_visual_v291220-1.pdf" class="govuk-link">graphic summarising testing for care home staff and residents</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">175KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">6 pages</span>)</span>.</p>

<h3>Workers with symptoms</h3>

<p>Care home workers with symptoms should be self-isolating and can access testing through the <a class="govuk-link" href="#self-referral">self-referral</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#employer-referral">employer referral</a> portals, above.</p>

<h3>Information about testing kits</h3>

<p>There are 2 types of test kits delivered to care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test kits known as Kingfisher kits</li>
  <li>lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test kits</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits should be used to test staff members weekly and residents every 28 days.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests should be used to test staff on their first day back to work following a period of leave that has resulted in someone missing their weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. In this case staff should be tested before they begin their shift.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are also used to test visitors and visiting professionals. See the full guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-lateral-flow-testing-of-visitors-in-care-homes">coronavirus (COVID-19) lateral flow testing of visitors in care homes</a>.</p>

<p>All of these kits are throat and nose swab tests and will tell a person whether they had coronavirus at the time the test took place. They cannot tell a person if they have had coronavirus in the past.</p>

<p>Watch a video on how to administer nasal and throat swabs for residents:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1l0jcv37WzI" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Coronavirus test tutorial for care homes with Dr Sarah Jarvis</a></p>

<p>Carers and nurses who will be swabbing residents in care homes should complete the online care home swabbing competency assessment before carrying out swabbing.</p>

<p>Individuals can register at <a rel="external" href="https://www.genqa.org/carehomes" class="govuk-link">www.genqa.org/carehomes</a> or care home managers can create an organisational account by contacting <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@genqa.org">info@genqa.org</a>.</p>

<p>Carers and nurses who will be conducting <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing on care home staff need to complete the NHS Test and Trace online training. Each home will receive an email with details giving them access to the training portal. Once access if granted, all testing staff are required to watch the training videos and complete the online assessment before they test. Please call 119 if you have not received an email with access details.</p>

<h3>Book your courier collection</h3>

<p>A courier will collect your used testing kits. These will be taken to a lab for processing.</p>

<p><a href="https://test-kit-collection.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Book your courier collection</a> by 7pm at least a day before carrying out testing.</p>

<p>Carry out testing on the day of collection.</p>
