<p>You can get a swab test to check if you currently have COVID-19. This is part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes">5-pillar strategy for COVID-19 testing</a>. Testing is most effective within 3 days of symptoms developing.</p>

<h2>Who can be tested</h2>

<p>Anyone with <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms">symptoms</a> can get a COVID-19 test, whatever their age.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a href="http://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">Get a COVID-19 test as soon as you have symptoms</a></p>
</div>

<p>If you do not have symptoms, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask your employer or place of study if they provide tests</li>
  <li><a href="https://maps.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">find where to collect test kits or get a test at a test site</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests" class="govuk-link">order rapid lateral flow home test kits online</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" rel="external">regular rapid tests if you do not have symptoms on NHS.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Find out about testing in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/test-and-protect/coronavirus-covid-19-get-a-test-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/symptom-free-covid-19-community-testing">Wales</a> or <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-and-contact-tracing" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h2>Register a home test kit</h2>

<p>This advice applies to home swab test kits that are sent to a lab for processing (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests).</p>

<p>Once you’ve taken your sample, you must register it via the link below so that we can send your results to you:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a rel="external" href="https://test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/register-home-test" class="govuk-link">Register a home test kit</a></p>
</div>

<h2>Record a rapid lateral flow test result</h2>

<p>If you had a rapid lateral flow test, you should get your result in 30 minutes after taking the test.</p>

<h4>You must report a positive result to the NHS.</h4>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">report your result online</a> or by calling 119 (free from mobiles and landlines).</p>

<p>We also ask that you report negative and invalid results: this helps the NHS to monitor the spread of the virus and support communities across the UK.</p>

<p>You do not need to report the results of tests that are processed at our labs (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests).</p>

<h2>If you’re about to go to hospital</h2>

<p>You may need to get tested if you’re due to have surgery or a procedure.</p>

<p>The hospital will arrange this for you. Contact your hospital department if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>Testing for essential workers with symptoms</h2>

<p>If you’re an essential worker and have symptoms of COVID-19, you’re prioritised to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a test for COVID-19 through the self-referral portal</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/essential-workers-prioritised-for-covid-19-testing" class="govuk-link">list of essential workers prioritised for COVID-19 testing</a>.</p>

<p>Employers should direct essential workers to the self-referral portal to get a prioritised test as the employer referral portal is now closed.</p>

<h2>The testing process</h2>

<p>The first step of taking a test for COVID-19 usually involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves (self-administered) or by someone else (assisted).</p>

<p>The different ways you can get tested are covered below.</p>

<h3>Test sites</h3>

<p>We’ve established a network of drive-through and walk-through test sites for people with COVID-19 symptoms. Test sites are open 7 days a week. If you have symptoms you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">book a test at a site near you online</a> or by calling 119.</p>

<p>Around 1 in 3 people with COVID-19 do not have any symptoms. Anyone can now get regular rapid lateral flow tests without having symptoms. You can go to a rapid lateral flow test site to get a rapid test.</p>

<p>Find out about <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/">regular rapid tests if you do not have symptoms on NHS.UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Home tests</h3>

<p>Home test kits can be delivered to your door so you can test yourself and your family without leaving your home.</p>

<h3>Instructions in alternative formats</h3>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/testing-for-coronavirus-at-home">instructions on testing for COVID-19 at home in accessible formats</a>.</p>

<p>Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) can send you braille, audio or large print instructions. After ordering a home test you can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/coronavirus-updates/test-kit-instructions/request?utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=promo&amp;utm_campaign=home-testing" class="govuk-link">send a request online</a></li>
  <li>call 0303 123 9999 (Monday to Friday 8am to 8pm, Saturday 9am to 1pm)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get help to register and take the test</h3>

<p>You can have a live video call with specially trained NHS Test and Trace staff to help you register and take a home COVID-19 test. Download the free <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id905177575?mt=8">Be My Eyes app&nbsp;for IOS</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bemyeyes.bemyeyes" rel="external">for Android</a>&nbsp;and go to the ‘specialised help’ section.</p>

<h3>Home swab test kits that are sent to a lab for processing (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests)</h3>

<p>Most people get their result the next day but it can take up to 3 days. Anyone with symptoms can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a test online</a> or by calling 119.</p>

<p>Watch how to take the test in this video: <a rel="external" href="https://youtu.be/8lo6g-TYZ-c" class="govuk-link">How to take a coronavirus self-test swab</a></p>

<h3>Rapid tests that give a result in 30 minutes (lateral flow tests)</h3>

<p>Find out about <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/">regular rapid tests if you do not have symptoms on NHS.UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting your results</h3>

<p>How and when you get your results depends on the type of COVID-19 test you’re taking. Follow the instructions that come with your kit carefully to ensure you take the right steps for the kit you’re using.</p>

<h3>Get a test if you’re visiting a care home</h3>

<p>If you’re visiting someone at a care home, you may be offered a rapid COVID-19 test when you arrive. The care home you’re visiting will provide you with the test kit. The test can tell if you’re infectious or not within 2 hours.</p>

<p>You’ll also be asked to put on protective clothing (PPE) as an additional step to help protect vulnerable residents. The degree of contact you can have with a care home resident will also depend on the care home’s own regulations and on national restrictions.</p>

<p>Watch a video on what to expect when visiting a care home resident: <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_1OMTytQZI">How to prepare for your care home visit</a></p>

<p>See guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">visiting arrangements in care homes</a>.</p>

<h3>Mobile testing units</h3>

<p>Mobile testing units travel around the UK to increase access to COVID-19 testing. They respond to need, travelling to test essential workers at sites including care homes, police stations and prisons.</p>

<p>New units are being brought into operation each day.</p>

<h3>Satellite centres</h3>

<p>NHS capability is being increased by providing test kits directly to ‘satellite’ centres at places like hospitals that have a particularly urgent or significant need.</p>

<h3>NHS facilities</h3>

<p>Testing within an NHS facility such as a hospital is available for patients and some NHS workers.</p>

<p>Across all these testing methods, there is a network of couriers who collect the completed samples and deliver them safely to one of our laboratories. The swab samples are analysed at our labs and the result is communicated back to the individual.</p>

<p>We aim to return test results within 48 hours of a swab being taken, or within 72 hours for a home test.</p>
