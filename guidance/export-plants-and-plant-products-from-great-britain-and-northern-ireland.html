<h2>Apply for a phytosanitary certificate</h2>

<p>You may need a phytosanitary certificate if you’re exporting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plants, including fruit, vegetables and cut flowers</li>
  <li>plant products</li>
  <li>seeds</li>
  <li>potatoes</li>
  <li>bulbs</li>
  <li>grain</li>
  <li>machinery or vehicles which have been operated for agricultural or forestry purposes</li>
  <li>wood and wood products</li>
</ul>

<p>All these goods must be inspected before you can get a phytosanitary certificate.</p>

<p>Read Forestry Commission guidance if you want to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-wood-wood-products-and-bark-from-great-britain">export wood, wood products and bark</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re exporting from England and Wales, you can apply online through <a class="govuk-link" href="http://edomero.defra.gov.uk/" rel="external">eDomero</a> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seeds</li>
  <li>bulbs</li>
  <li>grain</li>

<ul>
  <li>plants, including fruit, vegetables and cut flowers</li>
  <li>plant products</li>
  <li>machinery or vehicles which have been operated for agricultural or forestry purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re exporting certain fruits and vegetables, you may need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/fresh-fruit-and-vegetable-marketing-standards">certificate of conformity</a> as well as a phytosanitary certificate.</p>

<p>You apply a different way to export plants from Scotland and Northern Ireland. Contact the plant health authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland for more information.</p>

<h2>Apply for a certificate to re-export goods</h2>

<p>Re-export (also known as re-forwarding) is when goods are imported into a country and then exported to another country.</p>

<p>If you’ve imported goods to Great Britain and then want to move them to a different country, it may be possible to apply for a re-forwarding certificate.</p>

<p>Plant health inspectors will only be able to issue a re-forwarding certificate if they can be confident that the goods meet the destination country’s import requirements.</p>

<p>If you apply for a re-forwarding certificate, the inspector will decide whether a further inspection is needed. You may need a further inspection if the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>destination country’s rules say you must</li>
  <li>goods have been exposed to a risk of infestation or contamination after being imported</li>
</ul>

<p>It may be that the destination country has certain import requirements that include testing or growing season inspections. You should check this before you import the goods into Great Britain, as the phytosanitary certificate you use to import the goods will need to include this information if you wish to forward them on. This original phytosanitary certificate, or certified copies, will need to accompany the goods when they are re-exported.</p>

<p>You can apply for a re-forwarding certificate using the plant health export service, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-plant-export-certificates-and-inspections">Apply for plant export certificates and inspections service</a>.</p>

<h2>Register and apply with online export services</h2>

<p>If you’re moving plants from England, Wales or Scotland to Northern Ireland, you do not need to pay for them to be inspected and certified. Your certifier invoices the government for these costs as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/movement-assistance-scheme-get-help-with-moving-agrifood-goods-to-northern-ireland">movement assistance scheme (MAS)</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The following fees apply to exports from England and Wales to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries. For fees in Scotland please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health" rel="external">Scottish government</a>.</p>

<h3>Inspection costs</h3>

<p>For each inspection you’ll be charged a minimum of 30 minutes, which costs £127.60.</p>

<p>After that you’ll pay £63.80 for every 15 minutes of an inspector’s time spent on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carrying out the inspection on site</li>
  <li>associated on site activities</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll have to pay in full for every 15 minutes, even if it takes less time. For example, if it takes the inspector 42 minutes to do everything you will pay for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>The time it takes for the inspector to travel to and from the site to conduct the inspection is already included in the fees.</p>

<h3>Certificate and laboratory costs</h3>

<p>A phytosanitary certificate costs £25.52.</p>

<p>If you ask for an amendment to your phytosanitary certificate, you’ll pay £15.76.</p>

<p>You’ll pay £33.56 for each sample examined by a laboratory.</p>

<h3>Application costs</h3>

<p>If you submit an export certification application in paper form, rather than using the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://edomero.defra.gov.uk/" rel="external">online eDomero system</a>, you’ll pay an extra fee of £15.76.</p>

<h3>Reduced fees</h3>

<p>You can <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/967993/form-phe3.pdf">apply for the concessionary rate</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">470 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">1 page</span>)</span> for the first £1,500 (full price value) of <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> services in a financial year if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re exporting VAT-exempt goods</li>
  <li>you’re not registered for VAT and do not need to be registered in that financial year</li>
  <li>your certified exports were worth less than £5,000 in the last financial year</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exporting from Great Britain to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Switzerland or Liechtenstein, and moving goods to Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>All regulated plants and plant products exported from England, Scotland or Wales are subject to import controls.</p>

<p>This could include documentary, identity and physical checks at the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border.</p>

<p>Regulated plants and plant products include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all plants for planting</li>
  <li>root and tubercle vegetables</li>
  <li>some common fruits other than fruit preserved by deep freezing</li>
  <li>cut flowers</li>
  <li>seeds, and other plant or forest reproductive material</li>
  <li>leafy vegetables other than vegetables preserved by deep freezing</li>
  <li>some wood and wood products</li>

<h2>Border control posts (<abbr title="border control posts">BCPs</abbr>) in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Your goods will need to be exported to an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/official_controls/legislation/imports/plants_en" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr>, approved to handle plants and plant products in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Exempt plants and plant products</h2>

<p>Exempt plants and plant products do not need plant health controls and so will not be subject to import controls at <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries or Northern Ireland. You do not need a phytosanitary certificate to export these exempt goods.</p>

<p>These plants and plant products are exempt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pineapple</li>
  <li>coconut</li>
  <li>durian</li>
  <li>bananas</li>
  <li>grain</li>
  <li>plant products (such as fruit and vegetables) that have been processed and packaged to the point that they no longer pose a biosecurity risk composite products like nut and seed butters containing processed fruit or vegetables</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exporting high-risk and prohibited plants</h2>

<p>You cannot export some high-risk and prohibited goods from Great Britain to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>These fall into 2 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#high-risk-plants">high-risk plants and plant products</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#prohibited-plants-and-plant-products">prohibited plants and plant products</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>High-risk plants</h3>

<p>High-risk plants and plant products cannot enter the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Northern Ireland, until a full risk assessment is conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (<abbr title="European Food Safety Authority">EFSA</abbr>).</p>

<p>The following plants for planting from Great Britain are prohibited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acacia</li>
  <li>Acer</li>
  <li>Albizia</li>
  <li>Alnus</li>
  <li>Annona</li>
  <li>Bauhinia</li>
  <li>Berberis</li>
  <li>Betula</li>
  <li>Caesalpinia</li>
  <li>Cassia</li>
  <li>Castanea</li>
  <li>Cornus</li>
  <li>Corylus</li>
  <li>Crataegus</li>
  <li>Diospyros</li>
  <li>Fagus</li>
  <li>Ficus carica</li>
  <li>Fraxinus</li>
  <li>Hamamelis</li>
  <li>Jasminum</li>
  <li>Juglans</li>
  <li>Ligustrum</li>
  <li>Lonicera</li>
  <li>Malus</li>
  <li>Nerium</li>
  <li>Persea</li>
  <li>Populus</li>
  <li>Prunus</li>
  <li>Quercus</li>
  <li>Robinia</li>
  <li>Salix</li>
  <li>Sorbus</li>
  <li>Taxus</li>
  <li>Tilia</li>
  <li>Ulmus</li>
</ul>

<p>The prohibition does not apply to seeds, fruits, leaves, tissue culture material and naturally or artificially dwarfed woody plants of these species.</p>

<h3>High-risk plant products</h3>

<p>These plant products are prohibited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plants of Ullucus tuberosus</li>
  <li>fruits of Momordica from countries where Thrips palmi is present and effective mitigation measures are not in place</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to apply for an exemption from the high-risk prohibition</h3>

<p>An application will need to be submitted by Defra to the European Commission for every high-risk plant. The European Food Safety Authority (<abbr title="European Food Safety Authority">EFSA</abbr>) will then assess the information provided by Defra and complete a full risk assessment on the plant or plant product.</p>

<p>If the risk assessment allows the trade, the plant or plant product will be removed from the high risk list. But it may still need specific import requirements, including phytosanitary certification.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Food Safety Authority">EFSA</abbr> has set out the information and format required to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/en-1492" rel="external">submit an application</a>.</p>

<h3>Prohibited plants and plant products</h3>

<p>These plants and plant products are prohibited for export from Great Britain to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Northern Ireland. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>isolated bark of Castanea</li>
  <li>plants of Vitis, other than fruits</li>
  <li>plants of Citrus, Fortunella, Poncirus, and their hybrids, other than fruits and seeds</li>
  <li>tubers of Solanum tuberosum, seed potatoes</li>
  <li>plants for planting of stolon - or tuber-forming species of Solanum, and their hybrids</li>
  <li>soil as such consisting in part of solid organic substances</li>
  <li>growing medium as such, other than soil, consisting in whole or in part of solid organic substances, other than that composed entirely of peat or fibre of Cocos nucifera, previously not used for growing of plants or for any agricultural purposes</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Protected Zones of fireblight</h3>

<p>Plants and live pollen for pollination of the following species (excluding their fruit and seeds) are also prohibited when exporting to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/eu-exit-guidance/exports/eu-protected-zones-of-fireblight/#eu-protected-zones-of-fireblight" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Protected Zones of fireblight</a> (Erwinia amylovora):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amelanchier</li>
  <li>Chaenomeles</li>
  <li>Cotoneaster</li>
  <li>Crataegus</li>
  <li>Cydonia</li>
  <li>Eriobotrya</li>
  <li>Malus</li>
  <li>Mespilus</li>
  <li>Photinia davidiana</li>
  <li>Pyracantha</li>
  <li>Pyrus</li>
  <li>Sorbus</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to export prohibited plants and soil</h3>

<p>You can only send prohibited plants or soil to someone who has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-prohibited-plants-plant-pests-pathogens-and-soil">scientific licence</a> to receive them in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. They will have a ‘letter of authority’ with their licence.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to export prohibited material to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ask the recipient for a copy of their letter of authority.</li>
  <li>Send to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> to be endorsed.</li>
  <li>Attach the letter of authority to the outside of all packages before you send them. You should also include copies of the letter of authority inside the packaging.</li>
  <li>Store prohibited the plants or soil in 3 layers of packaging - at least 1 of the layers must be escape and shatter-proof.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the recipient tells you that you do not need a letter of authority, ask them to show you official confirmation of this from their plant health authority. Send this confirmation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> for England and Wales</li>
  <li>SASA for Scotland</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr> for Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not send your material until you have got confirmation from the recipient’s plant health authority and the relevant competent authority.</p>

<h2>Temporary operational measures for movement of some goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>There are some temporary operational measures in place to address issues for the movement of agricultural and forestry machinery and growing media from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>Agricultural and forestry machinery</h3>

<p>Traders can move used agricultural and forestry machinery without the need for a phytosanitary certificate, provided they are washed to remove excessive soil and plant debris.</p>

<p>This means machinery can still be moved if small amounts of soil remain.</p>

<p>Movements from Great Britain to the Republic of Ireland using a port in Northern Ireland must have a valid phytosanitary certificate and pre-notification on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/traces_en" rel="external">TRACES NT</a>.</p>

<h3>Growing media</h3>

<p>Bulbs or vegetables grown in soil can be sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, even if they still have soil attached, as long as they still respect any pest free area requirements.</p>

<p>Plants can be moved to Northern Ireland with soil and other growing media attached, provided they are from a business in Great Britain that is authorised to issue plant passports.</p>

<h2>Arrangements for authorised traders moving food from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>An arrangement is in place which allows authorised traders, such as supermarkets and their trusted suppliers, to move some goods without the need for official certification.</p>

<p>If you’re moving plants or plant products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you do not need official certification, such as export health certificates, phytosanitary certificates or marketing standards certification.</p>

<p>The following conditions will be attached to these arrangements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods are packaged for end consumers and have a label reading “These products from the United Kingdom may not be marketed outside Northern Ireland”</li>
  <li>they are destined solely for sale to end consumers in supermarkets located in Northern Ireland, and they cannot be sold to other operators of the food chain</li>
  <li>they are accompanied by a simplified official certificate globally stating the products meet all the import requirements of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation</li>
  <li>they enter Northern Ireland through a designated point of entry, where they are submitted to a systematic documentary check and to a risk-based identity check on a selection of items in the means of transport</li>
  <li>they are monitored through a channelling procedure applicable from the designated point of entry to the destination supermarket in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h3>Authorised traders</h3>

<p>Authorised traders are supermarkets and their trusted suppliers. The UK government will not discriminate against smaller suppliers or between different companies in recognising traders as authorised for the purpose of this arrangement.</p>

<p>A trusted supplier is any business that independently moves its products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, for sale in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>For example, a cut flower supplier that moves its own products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, which delivers directly to a store for sale within Northern Ireland only would be eligible for authorised trader status.</p>

<p>However, a cut flower supplier that delivers products to a supermarket distribution centre in Great Britain would not qualify if the products are then moved by the supermarket to Northern Ireland. In this instance, the supermarket would be the authorised trader for that movement into Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>Plant health exports audited trader scheme (PHEATS)</h3>

<p>If you export fruit, vegetables or cut flowers from Great Britain to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Northern Ireland, you may be eligible for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/resources/pheats-hompage/" rel="external">plant health exports audited trader scheme (PHEATS)</a>.</p>

<p>This means you’ll be able to do your own inspections and apply for phytosanitary certificates to be issued.
Find out how to apply and register for the scheme on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/resources/pheats-hompage/" rel="external">plant health portal</a>.</p>

<p>Under the PHEATS scheme, you’ll have to pay for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an initial site visit to include training, assessment and authorisation - £313.24 per authorisation</li>
  <li>an auditing / monitoring fee - £178.92 per audit</li>
  <li>the issue of a certificate - £25.52 per phytosanitary certificate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Movements from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h2>

<p>Qualifying Northern Ireland goods (<abbr title="Qualifying Northern Ireland goods">QNIGs</abbr>) can continue to move from Northern Ireland to Great Britain in the same way as they did before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p><abbr title="Qualifying Northern Ireland goods">QNIGs</abbr> are goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in free circulation in Northern Ireland - on the basis that they are not under customs supervision (except when that supervision arises from from the goods being taken out of Northern Ireland or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>), or</li>
  <li>which have undergone processing operations in Northern Ireland under the inward processing procedure, and only incorporate inputs which were in free circulation in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that if you are an operator based in Great Britain and receive a consignment of plants or plant products from Northern Ireland which are <abbr title="Qualifying Northern Ireland goods">QNIGs</abbr> and subject to plant passport requirements, they will continue to arrive at your premises with an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> plant passport as they do now.</p>

<p>As these are <abbr title="Qualifying Northern Ireland goods">QNIGs</abbr> you do not need to routinely replace this <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> plant passport with a UK plant passport, and the goods may be moved on under their <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> plant passport unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you split the consignment and the new ‘units’ (these may be trolleys, pallets, boxes, bags or similar) no longer have a plant passport attached to them, or</li>
  <li>you choose to replace the plant passport (for example, to include your supplier’s details for business purposes)</li>
</ul>

<p>If either apply, a UK plant passport could be issued without a full examination of the plants taking place before onward movement. This is in line with current guidance on when to replace a plant passport. You must keep records of any changes made.</p>

<p>If you replace a plant passport on a QNIG you must put the code ‘<abbr title="Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales)">GB</abbr>(<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>)’ in Part E of that replacement UK plant passport, to help maintain their identity as <abbr title="Qualifying Northern Ireland goods">QNIGs</abbr>.</p>

<p>This is to aid monitoring of compliance with plant passporting requirements, including the specific provisions for <abbr title="Qualifying Northern Ireland goods">QNIGs</abbr>.</p>

<p>This will help ensure that it is easily visible whether a good has originated outside of Great Britain’s phytosanitary zone, yet may not have undergone full third country checks, which will be important for tracing purposes in the event of a pest or disease is found.</p>

<p>If the phytosanitary status of your consignment changes, for example because traceability has not been maintained, there is a pest or disease issue with the consignment or the plants have been ‘grown on’, then a full examination will need to be carried out on the plants.</p>

<p>Once confirmed they are fully aligned with <abbr title="Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales)">GB</abbr> plant health standards, a standard UK plant passport with Part E left blank could be issued.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/issuing-plant-passports-to-trade-plants-in-the-eu">guidance on when plants have been ‘grown-on’</a>.</p>

<h2>Returned wood, plants and plant products: policy from 1 January 2021 to July 2022</h2>

<p>Plants and plant product consignments rejected at <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="border control posts">BCPs</abbr> can re-enter Great Britain through any point of entry from 1 January 2021 to July 2022.</p>

<p>You must submit an import pre-notification using the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/" rel="external">PEACH IT system</a> to notify <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> for rejected plants and plant products returning to England or Wales.</p>

<p>‘Pre-notification’ means giving advance notice to the responsible authority for goods that arrive in Great Britain.</p>

<p>You must give notice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 4 working hours before the goods land in Great Britain, for air and ‘roll-on-roll-off’ freight</li>
  <li>at least 1 working day before the goods arrive in Great Britain for all other freight</li>
</ul>

<p>For rejected plants and plant products returning to Scotland go to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health" rel="external">SASA</a>.</p>

<p>For wood and wood products returning to Great Britain (Scotland, England and Wales) you’ll need to notify the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-wood-wood-products-or-bark-from-non-eu-countries">Forestry Commission</a>.</p>

<p>You must include a copy of the original phytosanitary certificate with pre-notification.</p>

<p>If your consignment was exported without a phytosanitary certificate, before returning your goods please contact:</p>
