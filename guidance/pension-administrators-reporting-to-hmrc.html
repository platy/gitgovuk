<h2>Who submits the returns and event reports</h2>

<p>The scheme administrator is responsible for submitting the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pension scheme returns</li>
  <li>Accounting for Tax (<abbr title="Accounting for Tax">AFT</abbr>) returns</li>
  <li>event reports</li>
</ul>

<p>You can delegate these tasks but you remain responsible forev making sure they’re accurate and complete.</p>

<h2>Pension scheme returns</h2>

<p>If <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> needs more information about a registered pension scheme they may send you a notice telling you to complete a pension scheme return.</p>

<p>If your pension scheme has a pension scheme tax reference (<abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>) beginning with ‘0’ you must file your pension scheme return using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.hmrc.gov.uk%2Fhome&amp;_ga=2.130938447.117601244.1649149610-1654839305.1641478450" rel="external">Pension schemes online service</a>.</p>

<p>If your pension scheme has a <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> beginning with ‘2’, we’ll tell you how to file your pension scheme return when we issue your Notice to file</p>

<p>There are 2 versions of the pension scheme return, one for occupational schemes and the other for non-occupational schemes.</p>

<p>This pension scheme return should not be confused with either the scheme return that needs to be sent to The Pensions Regulator or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pension-trustees-self-assessment-tax-returns">form SA970</a> Tax Return for Trustees of Registered Pension Schemes.</p>

<h3>Deadline for submitting the pension scheme return</h3>

<p>The notice to file letter sent by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will state the date the pension scheme return must be submitted by. If the pension scheme return is not received by the deadline you’ll be charged a £100 penalty. Daily penalties of £60 may also be charged if the return is still not submitted.</p>

<h3>How to amend a submitted pension scheme return</h3>

<p>If you made a mistake on the original pension scheme return you should send an amended one as soon as you can. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.hmrc.gov.uk%2Fhome&amp;_ga=2.130938447.117601244.1649149610-1654839305.1641478450" rel="external">submit amendments using the Pension schemes online service</a>. You can start submitting an amendment 24 hours after you made the original submission online.</p>

<h3>How to amend submitted event reports</h3>

<p>If you made a mistake on the original Event Report you should send an amended Event Report as soon as you can.</p>
