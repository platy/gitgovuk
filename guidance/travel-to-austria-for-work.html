<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Austria to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>Austria’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migration.gv.at/en/welcome/?no_cache=1" rel="external">Austria’s government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Austria. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Austria’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Austria, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Austria’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Austria for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>going to court as a witness</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs</li>
  <li>attending board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>fact-finding visits</li>
  <li>negotiating deals or contracts</li>
  <li>attending conferences</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
  <li>buying goods and services</li>
  <li>accompanying a tour as a tour guide, tour operator or travel agent</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family
Or for these types of training, as long as it’s for the same company or group:</li>
  <li>classroom-based training</li>
  <li>on-the-job training</li>
</ul>

<h3>Attending business meetings</h3>

<p>You should only attend business meetings if there isn’t a colleague in Austria who can do this on your behalf. If you have to attend you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shouldn’t stay longer than a working week</li>
  <li>can’t charge the client for the meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your entire stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Austria’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work-related activities don’t require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>You do not require a visa or permit if you’re a musician, performer or broadcaster and in Austria for up to 4 weeks.
This includes those involved in film, TV or radio, including the technical production team. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.artist-mobility.at/en/employment/short-term-employed-artistic-activity-to-secure-an-overall-artistic-production.html" rel="external">Find out more about short-term artistic activity</a>.</p>

<p>The organiser needs to notify the local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ams.at/organisation/public-employment-service-austria" rel="external">public employment service</a> no later than the first day of work in Austria.</p>

<h3>EU intra-company transfer permits (EU ICT) from other countries</h3>

<p>You don’t need a visa or permit if you have an EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) from another country and you’re going to work for the Austrian branch for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.</p>

<p>Your employer has to notify the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmf.gv.at/en/topics/combating-fraud/zko.html" rel="external">Zentrale Koordinationsstelle (ZKO)</a> of the Federal Ministry of Finance before you travel.</p>

<p>Exemptions are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>employment confirmation</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma or professional certificate, or proof of artistic activities</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re going for other work purposes for up to 3 to 6 months, you may need a short-term work permit.</p>

<p>If you’re going for longer than 6 months days you may need a long-term permit.</p>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from Austria’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Austria’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>For the short-term visa and permits listed in this guide your family won’t be able to get dependant visas. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>There may be different rules for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/permanent-immigration/family-reunification/" rel="external">taking families</a> if you have a long-term permit.</p>

<h3>Short and long-term visa and permits</h3>

<p>You need a short-term visa or posting permit (Beschäftigungsbewilligung/Entsendebewilligung) if you’re providing short-term services to a client in Austria.</p>

<p>You need to apply for one of these permit types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#posting">posting permit if your UK employer has a contract or work order with an Austrian company</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#skilled">highly skilled key workers permit</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#freelancer">short-term freelancer visa</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You need to apply for a long-term residence and work permit if you’re working in Austria because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring long term from a UK-based company to a branch in Austria</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for an Austrian company on a long-term Austrian contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing long-term services to a client in Austria</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out long-term self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#founder">a founder of a start-up company in Austria</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#artist">working long term as an artist</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They are valid for up to 3 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<h2>Short-term posting permit</h2>

<p>You need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migration.gv.at/en/types-of-immigration/fixed-term-employment/posting-and-hiring-out-of-workers.html" rel="external">posting permit</a> if your UK employer has a contract or work order with an Austrian company for up to 6 months.</p>

<p>To qualify for a posting permit you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be paid a salary at an equivalent level to a similar position in Austria</li>
  <li>have relevant professional experience or a university degree</li>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract</li>
  <li>stay on UK payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>It takes 4 to 10 weeks to get. It’s valid for up to 4 months and you can extend it.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You need to check with Austria’s authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The Austrian client <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ams.at/unternehmen/service-zur-personalsuche/beschaeftigung-auslaendischer-arbeitskraefte/entsendung-aus-einem-nicht-eu-staat" rel="external">applies for your posting permit</a> at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ams.at/organisation/public-employment-service-austria" rel="external">Public Employment Service (AMS)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You apply for a C or D visa at the Austrian embassy. You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmeia.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Vertretungen/London/Dokumente/Visa_C_Application_form.pdf" rel="external">apply for a C visa: Erwerb (Schengen visa)</a> if you’re working for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmeia.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Vertretungen/London/Dokumente/Visa_D_-_Application_Form.pdf" rel="external">apply for a D visa: Erwerb</a> if you’re working for up to 4 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You register your address with your local city hall in Austria within 3 business days of arriving.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>Austria’s authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed permit application form</li>
  <li>UK passport, valid for 3 months (6 recommended) from the date you intend to leave Austria</li>
  <li>degree or other qualification certificate (if you have one)</li>
