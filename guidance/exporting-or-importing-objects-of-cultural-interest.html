<h2>Exporting objects of cultural interest from Great Britain</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
  <li>You need a UK licence to export cultural objects from the UK to any destination outside the UK.</li>
  <li>You do not need a licence to move objects of cultural interest from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>How to apply for a licence</h3>

<p>The licensing system is administered by Arts Council England (<abbr title="Arts Council England">ACE</abbr>), and the form can be <a rel="external" href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/export-controls/export-licensing#section-1" class="govuk-link">downloaded from <abbr title="Arts Council England">ACE</abbr>’s website</a>. You can also find more information about <a href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/export-controls/export-licensing#section-1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">procedures and guidance for exporters</a>, including information about when a referral to expert advisers is needed, the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/export-controls/export-licensing#section-2">Open General Export Licence</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/export-controls/export-licensing#section-3" class="govuk-link">statutory guidance</a>.</p>

<p>EU licences issued by <abbr title="Arts Council England">ACE</abbr> before 1 January 2021 will be valid for export at UK borders after the end of the transition period. The validity period for standard EU export licences is limited to 12 months. The offences, rights, obligations and restrictions relating to licences still apply after 1 January 2021. For example, the conditions of a temporary EU licence issued by the UK before 1 January 2021 (such as a deadline for the return of the object to the UK) will continue to apply and be enforceable after that date.</p>

<p>If you hold an EU licence issued by the UK authority before 1 January 2021, you cannot use it to authorise exports from EU Member States to destinations outside the EU after 1 January 2021. In this case, you should also seek advice from the licensing authority in the relevant EU Member State in order to ensure uninterrupted compliance with the EU and individual EU countries’ licensing regimes.</p>

<h3>If your licence is approved</h3>
<p>The issued licence will be posted in hard copy to the name and address shown in the Applicant box.
You will need to attach an electronic copy of the issued export licence to your Export Declaration and send it to HMRC’s National Clearance Hub through <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Officers at the National Clearance Hub will check the licences and declarations and if all is in order will notify <abbr title="Arts Council England">ACE</abbr> that Permission to Proceed (P2P) has been given so that the <abbr title="Arts Council England">ACE</abbr> can close that licence.</p>

<p>Exporters are advised to retain a physical copy of the licence and present to Border Force Officers if requested to do so.</p>

<h2>Exporting objects of cultural interest from Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>The requirements for exporting objects of cultural interest from Northern Ireland are different to those for Great Britain. Some exports of objects of cultural interest from Northern Ireland will require an EU export licence.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Exports from Northern Ireland to EU Member States require a UK export licence.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exports from Northern Ireland directly to non-EU countries require an EU export licence.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exports from Northern Ireland to Great Britain do not require an export licence issued by the UK. This includes objects from Northern Ireland which are being exported to a non-UK destination through a port or airport in Great Britain, which will require only a UK export licence for their final export from the UK.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exports from EU Member States which are in transit through Northern Ireland, which have not been definitively despatched from the EU or which have not entered into free circulation in Northern Ireland, may require an EU export licence issued by the relevant EU Member State to permit them to be exported to Great Britain.<br><br></p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>EU and UK export licences for objects of cultural interest from Northern Ireland are also issued by <abbr title="Arts Council England">ACE</abbr>. Information and guidance on export licences for objects of cultural interest is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/export-controls/export-licensing#section-1" rel="external"><abbr title="Arts Council England">ACE</abbr>’s website</a>.</p>

<p>If you are in any doubt as to whether you require an export licence or which export licence you require, you are strongly advised to contact <abbr title="Arts Council England">ACE</abbr> at: <a href="mailto:enquiries@artscouncil.org.uk" class="govuk-link">enquiries@artscouncil.org.uk</a></p>

<h2>Importing objects of cultural interest</h2>

<p>There are no licensing requirements for importing objects of cultural interest into the UK.</p>

<p>However, if you are importing items from the EU to the UK or another country outside the EU you’ll need to comply with the EU and individual EU countries’ export licensing regimes. You should check with the licensing authorities in the country of export to find out what you need to do.</p>

<h2>Importing objects of cultural interest into Northern Ireland from a country outside the EU, including from Great Britain</h2>

<p>It is prohibited to bring into Northern Ireland (and the EU) cultural goods listed at Part A of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.151.01.0001.01.ENG" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Annex to Regulation (EU) 2019/880</a> on the introduction and the import of cultural goods which have been removed from the country in which they were created or discovered in breach of the laws and regulations of that country. This prohibition includes cultural goods brought into Northern Ireland (and the EU) from Great Britain. It does not apply to cultural goods which were created or discovered in an EU Member State or Northern Ireland. The prohibition will be implemented by the UK border authorities for Northern Ireland on the basis of intelligence, and there are no changes to the way in which cultural goods are handled when they are lawfully brought into Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>This prohibition does not apply to cultural goods brought into Great Britain, including from Northern Ireland, as the EU Regulation has been revoked from UK law. This does not affect its continued application to Northern Ireland through the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>
