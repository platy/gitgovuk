<h2 id="rules-from-12-april-2019-imports-and-control-requirements">Rules from 12 April 2019: imports and control requirements</h2>

<p>After the UK leaves the EU, you’ll still be able to import animals, animal products, food and feed whether from the EU or elsewhere. However, the process for notifying the UK authorities of these imports will change. Some import requirements from the EU to the UK may also change.</p>

<p>Use this guidance to understand what will and will not change if you’re importing to the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>directly from third countries (non-EU member states or European Free Trade Agreement countries)</li>
  <li>from third countries and travelling through EU member states</li>
  <li>directly from EU member states</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="import-checklist">Import checklist</h2>
<p>To import animals, animal products, high-risk food and feed to the UK, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure you know <a href="#new-notification-process">the import notification process</a> for importing from non-EU and EU countries</li>
  <li>speak to your exporters from non-EU and EU countries to make sure they’re aware of the changes</li>
  <li>for live animals and germplasm coming from the EU, notify the Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) or the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr>) in Northern Ireland at least 24 hours in advance</li>
  <li>for live animals and germplasm coming from outside the EU, notify the UK border inspection post (<abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr>) that your consignment is arriving at least 24 hours in advance</li>
  <li>for products of animal origin (<abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>) and animal byproducts (<abbr title="Animal byproduct">ABP</abbr>) from the EU that travel on official documentation (an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (<abbr title="Intra trade animal health certificate">ITAHC</abbr>) or commercial documents like DOCOMs), notify <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> at least 24 hours before arrival</li>
  <li>for germplasm, <abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> and <abbr title="Animal byproduct">ABP</abbr> subject to vet checks, notify the UK <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr> (for non-EU trade) that your consignment is arriving in advance</li>
  <li>import non-EU high-risk food or feed of non-animal origin into the UK through a designated point of entry (<abbr title="Designated point of entry">DPE</abbr>)</li>
  <li>comply with wider <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/partnership-pack-preparing-for-a-no-deal-eu-exit">HMRC customs guidance</a> on customs requirements for importing and consider whether you’ll need an import agent</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-notification-process">New notification process for imports from non-EU countries and EU countries</h2>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 12 April, you’ll no longer have access to the EU’s import system <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> (Trade Control and Expert System) for importing into the UK.</p>

<p>To ensure imports of live animals, products of animal origin, animal byproducts, germplasm and high-risk food and feed not of animal origin can continue after exit, the UK is launching a new system called the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system">Import of products, animals, food and feed system</a> (<abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) is releasing <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr> in phases.</p>

<p>From 12 April, you can use <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr> if you’re importing live animals, animal products and high-risk food and feed not of animal origin from non-EU countries.</p>

<p>You can register for <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr> now, and create notifications for consignments arriving after 12 April.</p>

<p>Find out more about how to use it in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system-ipaffs-guidance"><abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr> user guidance</a>.</p>

<p>From summer 2019 you’ll be able to use <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr> to notify authorities of high-risk food and feed, live animals, germplasm from the EU. Until then you’ll need to <a href="#EU-to-UK">notify <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> using a different process</a>.</p>

<h3 id="direct-imports-from-outside-the-eu-to-the-uk">Direct imports from outside the EU to the UK</h3>

<p>If you import directly from outside the EU on 12 April changes will apply to requirements for notifications of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>live animals</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> subject to veterinary checks</li>
  <li>high-risk food and feed not of non-animal origin</li>
  <li>germplasm</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Animal byproduct">ABP</abbr> subject to veterinary checks</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr> instead of the EU’s <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> to notify imports</li>
  <li>import high-risk food or feed of non-animal origin into the UK through a <abbr title="Designated point of entry">DPE</abbr> as you do currently - find out which <abbr title="Designated point of entry">DPE</abbr> you need from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/port-designations">list of <abbr title="Designated points of entry">DPEs</abbr></a> on the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) website</li>
  <li>import live animals, germplasm, POAOs and <abbr title="Animal byproduct">ABP</abbr> into the UK through a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-border-inspection-posts-contact-details">UK <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr></a> (there is currently no <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr> in Dover)</li>
</ul>

<p>Health certificates and other documentation currently used for imports into the EU will be accepted for 6 months after the UK leaves the EU. After that, you’ll need to use a new UK health certificate.</p>

<h3 id="imports-from-outside-the-eu-travelling-via-eu-member-states">Imports from outside the EU travelling via EU member states</h3>

<p>If you’re importing <abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>, germplasm and <abbr title="Animal byproduct">ABP</abbr> not for human consumption that are subject to vet checks from non-EU countries but transiting through the EU to the UK, they’ll need to arrive in the UK through a <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you’re importing high risk food and feed from non-EU countries that will transit through the EU, they’ll need to arrive in the UK through a <abbr title="Designated point of entry">DPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Further guidance on transit goods for other commodities, such as live animals, will follow.</p>

<h3 id="EU-to-UK">Direct imports from EU countries to the UK</h3>

<p>Until <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr> is available in summer 2019, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-import-of-animals-and-products-food-feed-notify-authorities">download a form</a> from GOV.UK to notify authorities if you’re planning to import:</p>

<ul>
  <li>live animals, germplasm or equines that need a health certificate (for example an <abbr title="Intra trade animal health certificate">ITAHC</abbr>) or are travelling under official documentation (for example a DOCOM)</li>
  <li>animal byproducts travelling under official documentation</li>
  <li>animal products from EU countries with disease outbreak safeguards measures that need a health certificate</li>
  <li>equines travelling with a health attestation</li>
  <li>live animals that do not need a health certificate or official documentation but do have to be notified under Trade in Animals and Related Products regulations (<abbr title="Trade in Animals and Related Products">TARP</abbr>), for example insects, reptiles and amphibians</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re not sure what documents you need, check the import information notes on the <a rel="external" href="http://apha.defra.gov.uk/official-vets/Guidance/bip/iin/index.htm"><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> vet gateway</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to follow this process if you’re importing from Northern Ireland or the crown dependencies (Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man) to the UK.</p>

<p>You’ll need to notify <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> at least 24 hours before your consignment is due to arrive in the UK. Notify <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> as early as you can, up to 30 days before. 
<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will send you back a unique notification number.</p>

<p>If your consignment needs a health certificate, tell your official vet to put the number on the health certificate. Your exporter or official vet can download a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/eu-import-health-certificates">health certificate</a>.</p>

<p>If your consignment is travelling on official or commercial documentation, or a health attestation, you’ll need to add the number to the paperwork and email it to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you’re importing to Northern Ireland, email scanned copies of the health certificates to <abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr> on <a href="mailto:tradeadminpost@daera-ni.gov.uk">tradeadminpost@daera-ni.gov.uk</a> as soon as they’re available.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will check your health certificate or other documents against the notification form you sent. If there are any problems, they’ll get in touch with you to correct them.</p>

<p><abbr title="Intra trade animal health certificates">ITAHCs</abbr> will still be accepted for 6 months after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h2 id="importing-food-and-feed-from-eu-countries-to-the-uk">Importing food and feed from EU countries to the UK</h2>

<p>You can continue your normal trade activities for importing feed and food from the EU from 12 April. There will be no additional controls or checks. You will not need to notify these on <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr>.</p>

<p>You’ll need to notify UK authorities about high-risk food and feed products from the EU from summer 2019. Further details on this will be provided in advance.</p>

<p>Products may be considered high risk if they contain, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contaminants - mycotoxins and aflatoxins</li>
  <li>excessive pesticide residues</li>
  <li>salmonella</li>
  <li>heavy metals, for example mercury</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re importing high-risk products from countries outside the EU you will need to notify authorities using <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr>.</p>

<p>You’ll need to make sure your consignment travels through a <abbr title="Designated point of entry">DPE</abbr>. Find out which you need from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/port-designations">list of <abbr title="Designated points of entry">DPEs</abbr></a> on the <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> website.</p>

<p>Find out more information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/importing-high-risk-foods">high-risk products</a>, including the current list of products defined as high risk.</p>

<h2 id="importing-animal-byproducts-not-for-human-consumption-abp-from-eu-countries-to-the-uk">Importing animal byproducts not for human consumption (<abbr title="Animal byproduct">ABP</abbr>) from EU countries to the UK</h2>

<p>If you’re importing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal">category 3 <abbr title="Animal byproduct">ABP</abbr></a> from the EU, you can continue normal trade activities from 12 April. There will be no additional controls or checks.  It’s likely that from 12 April you will not be permitted to import <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal">category 1 and 2 <abbr title="Animal byproduct">ABP</abbr></a> from the EU.</p>

<h2 id="documents-for-transporters">Documents for transporters</h2>

<p>From 12 April 2019, documents issued by the UK will only be valid in the UK and not in EU countries.</p>

<p>Read the Department for Transport’s guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prepare-to-drive-in-the-eu-after-brexit-lorry-and-goods-vehicle-drivers">preparing to drive in the EU after Brexit</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you’re a UK transporter who transports live animals in the EU you’ll need to appoint a representative within an EU country. You’ll need to apply to the relevant government department to get a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transporter authorisation</li>
  <li>certificate of competence</li>
  <li>vehicle approval certificate</li>
  <li>journey log (where necessary)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="checks-at-the-uk-border">Checks at the UK border</h2>

<p>An increased number of checks is expected as consignments will need to be checked at UK <abbr title="Designated points of entry">DPEs</abbr> and <abbr title="Border inspection posts">BIPs</abbr>. This includes high-risk food and feed not of animal origin which travel through the EU and do not go through EU import checks.</p>

<p>Those carrying out the UK import control checks will be fully trained to minimise disruption. <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr> will be used to plan and record controls at <abbr title="Border inspection posts">BIPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Designated points of entry">DPEs</abbr> with notifications enabling the necessary checks to take place.</p>

<p>Find contact details for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-border-inspection-posts-contact-details">UK <abbr title="Border inspection posts">BIPs</abbr></a> on GOV.UK.

<h2 id="how-the-uk-government-is-working-with-interested-parties">How the UK government is working with interested parties</h2>

<p>The government will continue to work with businesses to help them prepare for these changes. We have published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system-ipaffs-guidance">guidance for users of <abbr title="Import of products, animals, food and feed system">IPAFFS</abbr></a>. Guidance for imports from the EU will follow.</p>

<h2 id="other-import-requirements">Other import requirements</h2>

<p>You will have to apply customs, excise and VAT procedures to goods traded with the EU. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/eori">get an Economic Operator Register and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Register and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number</a> to be able to trade</li>

<h2 id="trade-agreements">Trade agreements</h2>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be no implementation period. In this scenario, the government will seek to bring into force UK-third country agreements from exit day, or as soon as possible afterwards.</p>

<p>These new agreements will replicate existing EU agreements as far as possible. Where replacement trade agreements are not agreed, trade would take place on <a rel="external" href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm">World Trade Organization (<abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr>) terms</a> with that country. Details of each agreement will be shared with parliament and the public when they have been agreed.</p>
