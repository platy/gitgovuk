<p>The Home Secretary announced the Ukraine Family Scheme and the Local Sponsorship Scheme for Ukraine on 1 March 2022 which will provide additional support for Ukrainian nationals and their family members.</p>

<h2>Advice for British nationals in Ukraine</h2>

<p>There’s separate advice for British nationals in Ukraine. Check the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine">Ukraine foreign travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Ukraine Family Scheme</h2>

<p>You can apply for the Ukraine Family Scheme if you’re the immediate family member of a British national who usually lives in Ukraine. Your British national family member must be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>an unmarried partner (you must have been living together in a relationship for at least 2 years)</li>
  <li>your parent if you are under the age of 18</li>
  <li>your child under the age of 18</li>
  <li>an adult relative you provide care for who lives with you due to a medical condition</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s free to apply.</p>

<p>You must contact UKVI before you make an application.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Telephone: +44 808 164 8810 – select option 1 (0808 164 8810 if you’re in the UK – select option 1)
<br>Lines are open 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
<br>This is a free phone number.
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You’ll need to provide information about yourself and your family members, as well as contact details which will be shared with UKVI.</p>

<p>UKVI will then confirm whether you’re eligible for the Ukraine Family Scheme and share details of the gratis (free) application process.</p>

<p>There may be cases where some people do not meet the eligibility criteria, for example the English language requirement or minimum income requirement. Given the current circumstances, if somebody does not meet these requirements, UKVI will consider an alternative grant of leave to come to the UK.</p>

<p>Extended family members can apply to the Ukraine Family Scheme from Friday (4 March 2022).</p>

<p>All applicants to the Ukraine Family Scheme should follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Complete an online application form.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Book an appointment at any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre">Visa Application Centre</a> throughout Europe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attend a Visa Application Centre appointment, for accelerated security checks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remain in the location where you have submitted your application until we contact you.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Visa application centres</h3>

<p>The UK Visa Application Centre (VAC) in Kyiv is now closed and all UK visa services in Kyiv are suspended in order to keep people safe.</p>

<p>Family members of British nationals who usually live in Ukraine and need a UK visa can apply through and provide their biometrics at the new, temporary locations in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lviv, Ukraine (Bogdana Hmelnytskogo str., 176, Business Centre Lemberg)</li>
  <li>Rzeszow, Poland (uk. Warszawska 18, (35-205))</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, you can apply through an existing VAC in a nearby country if you can safely travel. VACs are currently operating in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hungary</li>
  <li>Moldova</li>
  <li>Poland</li>
  <li>Romania</li>
</ul>

<p>Before attending a VAC you must complete your online application form and have a GWF reference number.</p>

<p>Currently, all other visa applicants are unable to apply through a VAC in Ukraine. If you can safely travel, you can apply through a VAC in one of these nearby countries.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre">Find a visa application centre</a>.</p>

<p>If you intend the enter the UK by sea or rail you must still apply for a family visa and attend the closest available VAC.</p>

<h3>After you apply</h3>

<p>You’ll need to attend an appointment at a visa application centre (VAC) to provide your biometric information (fingerprints).</p>

<p>Family members of British nationals who usually live in Ukraine can access (walk-in) appointments in Lviv, Rzeszow or can apply outside Ukraine if you can travel safely.</p>

<p>You can upload supporting documents for your application online before attending your VAC appointment or you can have your documents uploaded at your appointment. There is a fee for uploading your documents at the VAC.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you did not keep your passport when you submitted your visa application in Kyiv, you will be contacted by the VAC to discuss how and when your passport will be returned to you. In the meantime, your passport will remain in a secure location in the Kyiv VAC.</p>
</div>

<h3>How long it takes</h3>

<p>UKVI aim to process family migration visa applications as quickly as possible and your application will be prioritised.</p>

<p>Where family members of British nationals who usually live in Ukraine have given their biometrics and have retained their passport, but haven’t received their vignette, they should contact UKVI on:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Telephone: +44 808 164 8810 – select option 1 (0808 164 8810 if you’re in the UK – select option 1)
<br>Lines are open 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
<br>This is a free phone number.
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Your details will be passed to UKVI caseworkers who will try to help facilitate travel.</p>

<h3>Other visas</h3>

<p>Ukrainian nationals in Ukraine (who aren’t immediate family members of British nationals normally living in Ukraine, or where the British national is living in the UK), are currently unable to make visa applications to visit, work, study or join family in the UK through a VAC in Ukraine.</p>

<p>If you can safely travel, you can apply through a VAC in a nearby country.</p>

<p>If you need assistance, contact UKVI:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Telephone: + 44 808 164 8810 – select option 3 (0808 164 8810 if you're in the UK – select option 3)  
<br>Monday to Friday 24 hours
<br>This is a free phone number.
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>Local Sponsorship Scheme for Ukraine</h3>

<p>The government has announced plans for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/further-support-for-ukrainians-fleeing-russia-invasion">new sponsorship scheme for Ukrainians</a> without any family ties to the UK. The scheme will allow sponsors, such as communities, private sponsors or local authorities, to bring those forced to flee Ukraine to the UK.</p>

<p>There will be no limit on this scheme and we will welcome as many Ukrainians as wish to come and have matched sponsors.</p>

<p>Those who come under this scheme will also be granted leave for an initial period of 12 months and able to work and access public services.</p>

<p>The government will work closely with international partners and neighbouring countries on the scheme to ensure that displaced Ukrainians are supported to apply.</p>

<p>We will also make sure that those who want to sponsor an individual or family can volunteer and be matched quickly with Ukrainians in need, working closely with the devolved administrations and local authorities across the country.</p>

<p>Further details on the scheme for people will be published soon, including information on how people and organisations in the UK can apply to be sponsors.</p>

<h3>If you need to travel to the UK urgently</h3>

<p>If you need to travel to the UK urgently for compassionate reasons you should apply for a visa in the usual way at the nearest VAC if you can travel safely and include clear compelling or compassionate reasons for your visit in your application. You should also tell staff at the VAC about these reasons during your appointment.</p>

<h2>Ukrainians in the UK</h2>

<p>The Home Office has agreed some temporary concessions to support Ukrainian nationals currently in the UK who are now unable to return when their existing visa expires. These concessions will assist Ukrainian nationals in remaining in the UK without having to leave and re-apply from overseas.</p>

<p>If you’re in the UK and unable to return to Ukraine, you may be able to extend your visa or switch to another immigration route even if your visa does not normally allow you to do so.</p>

<h3>Visitors</h3>

<h4>If you are a visitor</h4>

<p>The Home Office has introduced a temporary concession to allow Ukrainian nationals in the UK on a visitor visa to switch into a points-based route or a family visa route.</p>

<p>If you are in the UK on a visitor visa and cannot return to Ukraine you can apply to switch to another visa. You will need to meet the requirements of that visa route and pay the associated visa fee(s).</p>

<h3>Skilled Workers</h3>

<h3>If you are a Skilled Worker</h3>

<p>If you are on a Skilled Worker visa that is due to expire you can apply to extend your leave or apply for settlement if you meet the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>Full details can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">Skilled Worker visa guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Students</h3>

<h4>If you are a student</h4>

<p>If you are on a Student visa that is due to expire you can apply to extend your leave or switch to a Graduate visa, if you meet the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>Full details can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa">Student visa guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Seasonal Workers</h3>

<h4>If you are a seasonal worker</h4>

<p>You can extend your visa to 31 December 2022 if you cannot return to Ukraine. You must continue working in a job permitted by the Seasonal Worker route, with the same Scheme Operator (your sponsor).</p>

<p>You do not need to do anything. UKVI will work with your Immigration Sponsor to progress your visa extension. You’ll receive a notification from the Home Office that this concession applies to you.</p>

<h4>If you are an HGV driver</h4>

<p>You can extend your visa to 31 December 2022 if you cannot return to Ukraine. You must continue working in your current occupation with the same sponsor.</p>

<p>You do not need to do anything. UKVI will work with your Immigration Sponsor to progress your visa extension.  You’ll receive a notification from the Home Office that this concession applies to you.</p>

<h4>If you are a pork butcher</h4>

<p>You can request a temporary extension in the seasonal worker route until 31 December 2022 if you cannot return to Ukraine.</p>

<p>If you request a temporary extension in the seasonal worker route you do not need to do anything. UKVI will work with your Immigration Sponsor to progress your visa extension.  You’ll receive a notification from the Home Office that this concession applies to you.</p>

<p>You may, however, be eligible for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">Skilled Worker route</a>, subject to meeting the Immigration Rules. You should discuss with your employer.</p>

<p>If you are in the UK and need assistance, contact UKVI:</p>
