<p>If you’re planning to travel to the UK, you’ll need to make sure you comply with all <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">COVID-19 travel restrictions</a>. Please check the travel advice issued by your carrier and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control">check what you need to do before entering the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Advice for British nationals in Ukraine</h2>

<p>There’s separate advice for British nationals in Ukraine. Check the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine">Ukraine foreign travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Non-British family members of British nationals in Ukraine</h2>

<h3>Family migration visas</h3>

<p>You can apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa">family migration visa</a> for free if you’re the family member of a British national who usually lives in Ukraine. Your British national family member must be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>an unmarried partner (you must have been living together in a relationship for at least 2 years)</li>
  <li>your parent if you are under the age of 18</li>
  <li>your child under the age of 18</li>
  <li>an adult relative you provide care for who lives with you due to a medical condition</li>
</ul>

<p>You should contact UKVI before you make an application.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Telephone: +44 300 3032785 – select option 1 (0300 3032785 if you’re in the UK – select option 1)
<br>Lines are open 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
<br>This is a free phone number, but network charges may still apply.
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You’ll need to provide information about yourself and your family members, as well as contact details which will be shared with UKVI.</p>

<p>UKVI will then confirm whether you’re eligible for a family migration visa and share details of the gratis (free) application process.</p>

<p>If you are not eligible for a family migration visa, you will be advised to consider applying for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#different-visa">different visa</a>.</p>

<h3>Visa application centres</h3>

<p>The UK Visa Application Centre (VAC) in Kyiv is now closed and all UK visa services in Kyiv are suspended in order to keep people safe.</p>

<p>Family members of British nationals who usually live in Ukraine and need a UK visa can apply through the new, temporary location in the Lemberg Business Centre in the city of Lviv to give their biometrics. Alternatively, you can apply through a VAC in a nearby country if you are able to safely travel. VACs are currently operating in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Poland</li>
  <li>Romania</li>
  <li>Hungary</li>
  <li>Moldova</li>
</ul>

<p>All other visa applicants will be unable to apply through a VAC in Ukraine. If you are able to safely travel, you can apply through a VAC in one of these nearby countries.</p>

<h3>After you apply</h3>

<p>You’ll need to attend an appointment at a visa application centre (VAC) to provide your biometric information (fingerprints).</p>

<p>Family members of British nationals who usually live in Ukraine can access (walk-in) appointments in Lviv or can apply outside Ukraine.</p>

<p>You can upload supporting documents for your application online before attending your VAC appointment or you can have your documents uploaded at your appointment. There is a fee for uploading your documents at the VAC.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you did not keep your passport when you submitted your visa application, you will be contacted by the VAC to discuss how and when your passport will be returned to you. In the meantime, your passport will remain in a secure location in the VAC.</p>
</div>

<h3>How long it takes</h3>

<p>UKVI aim to process family migration visa applications, or contact you about your application, within 24 hours from when you have submitted your biometrics (fingerprints) at the VAC.</p>

<p>Where family members of British nationals who usually live in Ukraine have given their biometrics and have retained their passport, but haven’t received their vignette, they should contact UKVI on:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Telephone: +44 300 3032785 – select option 1 (0300 3032785 if you’re in the UK – select option 1)
<br>Lines are open 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
<br>This is a free phone number, but network charges may still apply.
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>UKVI caseworkers will try to contact family members of British nationals who usually live in Ukraine to help facilitate travel.</p>

<h3>Other visas</h3>

<p>Ukrainian nationals in Ukraine (who aren’t immediate family members of British nationals normally living in Ukraine, or where the British national is living in the UK), are currently unable to make visa applications to visit, work, study or join family in the UK through a VAC in Ukraine.</p>

<p>If you are able to safely travel, you can apply through a VAC in one of the nearby countries.</p>

<p>If you need assistance, contact UKVI:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Telephone: + 44 300 3032785 – select option 3 (0300 3032785 if you're in the UK – select option 3)  
<br>Monday to Friday 24 Hours
<br>This is a free phone number, but network charges may still apply.
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>If you need to travel to the UK urgently</h3>

<p>If you need to travel to the UK urgently for compassionate reasons you should apply for a visa in the usual way and include clear compelling or compassionate reasons for your visit in your application. You should also tell staff at the VAC about these reasons during your appointment.</p>

<h2>Ukrainians in the UK</h2>

<p>The Home Office has agreed some temporary concessions to support Ukrainian nationals currently in the UK who are now unable to return when their existing visa expires. These concessions will assist Ukrainian nationals in extending their stay in the UK without having to leave and re-apply from overseas.</p>

<p>If you’re in the UK and unable to return to Ukraine, you may be able to extend your visa or switch to another one even if your visa does not normally allow you to do so.</p>

<h3>Visitors</h3>

<h4>If you are a visitor</h4>

<p>The Home Office has introduced a temporary concession to allow Ukrainian nationals in the UK on a visitor visa to switch into a points-based route or a family visa route.</p>

<p>If you are in the UK on a visitor visa and cannot return to Ukraine you can apply to switch to another visa. You will need to meet the requirements of that visa route and pay the associated visa fee(s).</p>

<h3>Skilled Workers</h3>

<h3>If you are a Skilled Worker</h3>

<p>If you are on a Skilled Worker visa that is due to expire you can apply to extend your leave or apply for settlement if you meet the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>Full details can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">Skilled Worker visa guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Students</h3>

<h4>If you are a student</h4>

<p>If you are on a Student visa that is due to expire you can apply to extend your leave or switch to a Graduate visa, if you meet the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>Full details can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa">Student visa guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Seasonal Workers</h3>

<h4>If you are a seasonal worker</h4>

<p>You can extend your visa to 31 December 2022 if you cannot return to Ukraine. You must continue working in a job permitted by the Seasonal Worker route, with the same Scheme Operator (your sponsor).</p>

<p>You do not need to do anything. UKVI will work with your Immigration Sponsor to progress your visa extension. You’ll receive a notification from the Home Office that this concession applies to you.</p>

<h4>If you are an HGV driver</h4>

<p>You can extend your visa to 31 December 2022 if you cannot return to Ukraine. You must continue working in your current occupation with the same sponsor.</p>

<p>You do not need to do anything. UKVI will work with your Immigration Sponsor to progress your visa extension.  You’ll receive a notification from the Home Office that this concession applies to you.</p>

<h4>If you are a pork butcher</h4>

<p>You can request a temporary extension in the seasonal worker route until 31 December 2022 if you cannot return to Ukraine.</p>

<p>If you request a temporary extension in the seasonal worker route you do not need to do anything. UKVI will work with your Immigration Sponsor to progress your visa extension.  You’ll receive a notification from the Home Office that this concession applies to you.</p>

<p>You may, however, be eligible for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">Skilled Worker route</a>, subject to meeting the Immigration Rules. You should discuss with your employer.</p>

<p>If you are in the UK and need assistance, contact UKVI:</p>
