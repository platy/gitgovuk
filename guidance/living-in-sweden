<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sweden/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Sweden</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to live in Sweden for more than 1 year, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish/individualsandemployees/movingtosweden.4.7be5268414bea064694c40c.html" class="govuk-link">register with the Swedish Population Register</a>. The Swedish authorities will issue you an ID number (personnummer).</p>

<p>You can only register if you have a <a rel="external" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/EU-citizens-and-long-term-residents/Work-study-or-live-in-Sweden-for-EU-citizens.html" class="govuk-link">right of residence (uppehÃ¥llsrÃ¤tt)</a> for a year or more and comprehensive travel insurance. As an EU citizen, you will automatically have this right if you can support yourself, either by work or by other independent means, or you are studying.</p>

<p>You will not be able to register if you are still <a rel="external" href="https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish/individualsandemployees/movingtosweden/citizenofeueeacountry/youarelookingforwork.4.5a85666214dbad743ffff66.html" class="govuk-link">looking for a job when you come to Sweden</a> and or do not meet other requirements for residency.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re planning to move as a dependent to a family member who lives in Sweden you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/EU-citizens-and-long-term-residents/Residence-permit-for-EU-citizens.html" class="govuk-link">apply for a residence permit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you are resident in Sweden before the end of the implementation period you will be able to stay. Read the Swedish government guidance on residency after Brexit on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/About-the-Migration-Agency/Brexit.html" class="govuk-link">Swedish Migration Agency website</a> (Migrationsverket).</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal your residence permit will become invalid if it was acquired based on EU citizenship as opposed to Swedish national laws.</p>

<p>The Swedish government has put in place rules to give you time to register correctly as a resident. UK nationals and their families, even from outside the EU, will be exempt from residency requirements until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Children under 18 who live outside Sweden will be included in the exemption if they join you during the grace period. Children born after Brexit will have the same rights as their parents.</p>

<p>You do not have to do anything to be included in the exemption. Your rights to live, work, study, receive healthcare and social benefits will not be affected during this time.</p>

<p>Once you have applied for a residency permit, your stay is legal. You can continue to receive social benefits until a decision is made.</p>

<p>The grace period will end on 31 December 2020. If you have applied for citizenship and your application has not yet been approved towards the end of the grace period you must apply for a residence permit in the meantime. This will not affect your citizenship application.</p>

<p>Check updates to this guide and the <a rel="external" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/About-the-Migration-Agency/Brexit.html" class="govuk-link">Swedish Migration Agency website</a> on when and how to apply for a residence permit or citizenship until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, the Swedish government is proposing to create a special residency permit (SÃ¤rskilda regler om uppehÃ¥llstillstÃ¥nd vid ett avtalslÃ¶st brexit) for UK nationals who are presently in Sweden under EU freedom of movement regulation.</p>

<p>According to the proposal, this will be separate to and distinct from the ordinary residency process permit for third country nationals and be based on the EU regulation on freedom of movement. This guide will be updated as more information becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="passports">Passports</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Sweden.</p>

<p>You can check our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sweden" class="govuk-link">travel advice</a> for Sweden.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/" class="govuk-link">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180-day period. You must retain evidence of travel, like train and plane tickets, in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<p>If you want to travel outside of the country on a UK passport you will need to have it stamped by the Swedish Migration Agency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this indicates your status and allows you to return to Sweden without a residence permit. You only need to have your passport stamped once during the 1-year exemption period</li>
  <li>apply on <a rel="external" href="http://www.migrationsverket.se/" class="govuk-link">the Swedish Migration Agency website</a>
</li>
  <li>the stamp is only valid for the 1-year exemption. After the exemption period, you cannot leave Sweden and be sure of return without a valid residency permit</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="driving-in-sweden">Driving in Sweden</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Sweden, you should exchange your UK licence for a Swedish driving licence before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You can still use your Swedish licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<h3 id="driving-after-brexit">Driving after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, driving licence rules will stay the same during the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, your driving licence will remain valid in Sweden until 31 December 2020.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Sweden and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Sweden, you must not use your EHIC from the UK to access healthcare in Sweden.</p>

<p>When you travel to Sweden for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a> and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">foreign travel insurance</a>

</ul>

<p>If you are a student, read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/" class="govuk-link">the NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sweden-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners" class="govuk-link">an English-speaking doctor in Sweden</a>.</p>

<p>Check that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">your prescriptions are legal</a> in Sweden. Many over-the-counter medicines in the UK are only available by prescription in Sweden. You can only buy medicines at authorised chemists (Apoteket).</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights on healthcare in Sweden will remain the same, as long as you remain covered by the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, you will be able to continue to access healthcare until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>You must apply for a residence permit to continue to access healthcare after 31 December 2020. You will continue to obtain healthcare until there is a decision on your application, even if it takes longer than a year.</p>

<p>If you currently have your healthcare costs paid for by the UK government, we can help if you are asked to pay for treatment during the first 6 months after Brexit. To organise a payment, you must give your healthcare providerâ€™s details to the NHS Business Services Authorityâ€™s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>The UK government has offered to continue paying the country you live in for your healthcare if thereâ€™s no deal, as it does now. The government has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Sweden for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If thereâ€™s no deal, and there is no arrangement with Sweden to continue reciprocal healthcare, pensioners receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid if thereâ€™s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal, however this relies on Sweden continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>
