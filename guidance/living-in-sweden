<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU and provides for a deal on citizensâ€™ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the EU broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Sweden at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Sweden.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information.</p>

<p>In the meantime, make sure you are registered as a resident in Sweden. We will update this guidance as soon as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>

<p>There will be no change in residency rules or registration procedures if you arrive in Sweden before or on 31 December 2020. If you are resident in Sweden before or on 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency registration processes, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<p>If you plan to live in Sweden for more than 1 year, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish/individualsandemployees/movingtosweden.4.7be5268414bea064694c40c.html" class="govuk-link">register with the Swedish Population Register</a>. The Swedish authorities will issue you an ID number (personnummer).</p>

<p>You can only register if you have a <a rel="external" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/EU-citizens-and-long-term-residents/Work-study-or-live-in-Sweden-for-EU-citizens.html" class="govuk-link">right of residence (uppehÃ¥llsrÃ¤tt)</a> for a year or more and comprehensive travel insurance. Under the Withdrawal Agreement, you will automatically have this right if you can support yourself, either by work or by other independent means, or you are studying.</p>

<p>You will not be able to register if you are still <a rel="external" href="https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish/individualsandemployees/movingtosweden/citizenofeueeacountry/youarelookingforwork.4.5a85666214dbad743ffff66.html" class="govuk-link">looking for a job when you come to Sweden</a> and or do not meet other requirements for residency.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Sweden.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Sweden, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to other Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the UK and the Ireland will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-sweden">Driving in Sweden</h2>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are a resident in Sweden, you should exchange your UK licence for a Swedish one. You can still use your Swedish licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are living in Sweden or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, youâ€™ll have life-long healthcare rights in Sweden as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Sweden and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-sweden#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Sweden, you must not use your EHIC from the UK to access healthcare in Sweden.</p>

<p>When you travel to Sweden for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a> and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad" class="govuk-link">tell the UK government offices that deal with your pension</a> if you retire abroad.</p>

<p>If you retire in Sweden, you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your pension through <a rel="external" href="https://www.pensionsmyndigheten.se/" class="govuk-link">the Swedish Pensions Agency</a>, if you have worked in Sweden</li>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances" class="govuk-link">UK State Pension</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">new UK State Pension</a>. Contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre" class="govuk-link">International Pension Centre</a> to claim</li>

<h3 id="life-certificates">Life certificates</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances" class="govuk-link">â€˜life certificateâ€™ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to fill it in promptly or your payments may be suspended.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-31-december-2020">Pensions after 31 December 2020</h3>

<p>There will be no changes before 31 December 2020 to the rules on claiming the UK State Pension in the EU, EEA or Switzerland as a result of the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020 you will get your UK State Pension uprated every year for as long as you continue to live there. This will happen even if you start claiming your pension on or after 1 January 2021, as long as you meet the qualifying conditions explained in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">new State Pension guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you are living in Sweden by 31 December 2020, you will be able to count future social security contributions towards meeting the qualifying conditions for your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Sweden, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Swedish pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are considering moving to Sweden on or after 1 January 2021 and you are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, the rules depend on negotiations with the EU and may change. Check our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/benefits-and-pensions-for-uk-nationals-in-the-eea-or-switzerland" class="govuk-link">guidance on benefits and pensions in the EU</a>.</p>

<p>You can continue to receive your UK State Pension if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland and you can still claim your UK State Pension.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are moving or retiring abroad.</p>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits if you live in Sweden.</p>

<ul>
  <li>read guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad" class="govuk-link">tool to check which benefits you can claim while youâ€™re abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit cannot be paid to you if youâ€™re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020, you will continue to receive any UK benefits you already receive. This will continue for as long as you live there and meet all other eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Sweden, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Swedish contribution-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim your pension after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are considering moving to Sweden on or after 1 January 2021 and you are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, the rules depend on negotiations with the EU and may change.
