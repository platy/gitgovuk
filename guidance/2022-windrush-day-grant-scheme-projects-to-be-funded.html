      <td>The project is an 8-week steel pan project bringing together multi- generational participants to learn the history of the steel pan and learn how to play. Huddersfield has a history of steel pan musicians bringing their skills and knowledge to the UK during the Windrush years. Windrush Day will host an event for learners to showcase their new talent and tell the story of the history of steel pan. The musicians will then perform at a family friendly event in July. The itinerary includes activities that will bring our Windrush communities, descendants and diverse communities of Kirklees together.</td>

      <td>The project will coincide with the unveiling of the Windrush Monument on 22 June at Waterloo, bringing 180 people down the river to celebrate with the local Tilbury community on Windrush Day. This will include arriving in Tilbury by boat at a celebration in the Cruise Terminal, and on the dock where the MV Empire Windrush originally docked which will be a special event for many people. The displays and performances at the terminal and on the boat will show case hand painted flags telling Windrush stories to the fantastic Walkway of Memories by Evewright.</td>

      <td>The project will deliver a documentary in Luton about the Windrush generation through the eyes of young people, learning a legacy through the accounts of descendants who had varying ambitions to either settle or envisaged returning to the Caribbean after a period of time. The documentary aims to archive the connections as many of these individuals have since passed away but have left in many cases a verbal history with their children. This intent will be to leave a record that can educate future generations and used a resource. The project plan to place the documentary with Luton Heritage Forum as there is currently nothing of cultural significance regarding Caribbean people within the area.</td>
