<h2>If you were living in Cyprus before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Cyprus since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>You can also read the <a href="https://brexit.com.cy/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Cypriot government guidance on the Withdrawal Agreement</a></p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Cypriot government and your local authority. You should also read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cyprus" class="govuk-link">Cyprus travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Cyprus read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cyprus/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.
If you were legally resident in Cyprus and you can prove that you arrived in Cyprus before 1 January 2021, you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cyprus/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Cyprus</a>. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/page07_en/page07_en?OpenDocument" rel="external">Cypriot government guidance on visas</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to stay longer than 90 days as a visitor, you need to <a href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/CRMD/crmd.nsf/All/6537752D9FC166A0C2257D2C00382AD7?OpenDocument" class="govuk-link" rel="external">apply for residency as a third country national</a>. A third country national is someone who does not have EU, EEA or Swiss nationality.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Cyprus before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you have lived in Cyprus since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have rights under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>If you have a MEU residence document</h3>
<p>If you registered as a resident before 1 January 2021, you will have a MEU1 or MEU3 residence document. Your non-EU family members will have a MEU2. You can exchange your MEU residence document for the MUKW biometric Withdrawal Agreement residence document.</p>

<h3>If you do not have a MEU residence document</h3>
<p>If you did not register before 1 January 2021, you should request the MUKW biometric Withdrawal Agreement residence document for yourself and your family. You can replace your EU residence document (the MEU) with the MUKW residence document.</p>

<p>If you have been legally resident in Cyprus for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>over 5 years: you are eligible for permanent residency and a renewable residency document (MUKW3), initially valid for 10 years</li>
  <li>less than 5 years: you are eligible for a residence document valid for 5 years (MUKW1)</li>
  <li>non-EU family members are eligible for a MUKW2 document</li>
</ul>

<p>We strongly recommend that you request the MUKW residence document. While MEU documents remain valid until their expiry date, the MUKW residence document shows that you have the rights defined in the Withdrawal Agreement. The biometric card is more durable and it will simplify administrative processes. It shows your right to enter Cyprus exempts you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements. You can use also the biometric channel at border crossings.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://brexit.com.cy/en/residence.html">Cypriot government guidance residency in Cyprus</a>. If you need further help on how to secure your residency, you may find the <a rel="external" href="http://www.cyprus-crpg.org/" class="govuk-link">Cyprus Residency Planning Group website</a> useful.</p>

<p>You can obtain the MUKW residence document for a fee from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/contact_en/contact_en?OpenDocument&amp;ExpandSection=1#_Section1">Civil Registry and Migration Department</a> in Nicosia</li>

</ul>

<p>You must <a href="https://crmd.simplybook.pro/v2/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">book an appointment online</a>, so you can submit your documents and have your biometric data taken. You will be contacted when your MUKW residence document is approved. You collect your MUKW residence document from the office where you applied.</p>

<p>If you have not had a reply to your request for a MUKW residence document, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/contact_en/contact_en?OpenDocument">contact the Civil Registry and Migration Department</a>.</p>

<p>If your application is pending, you will be contacted for additional documents.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>
<p>If your residency application is refused, the refusal letter will explain how to appeal. If you need legal advice, read our list of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyprus-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers-for-the-republic-of-cyprus" class="govuk-link">English-speaking lawyers in cyprus</a>. If your appeal is rejected, you may be able to <a href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/All/D0B62F3A3B68AFA8C2257D2C0037B99D?OpenDocument" rel="external" class="govuk-link">apply for long term residence as a third country national</a>.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>
<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Cyprus at any time in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>They must travel to Cyprus and then apply as your family member. Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Cypriot authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.
Your family members will qualify for permanent residence after 5 years of continuous residence in Cyprus. Children born or adopted after 1 January 2021 will get the same residence rights as their family members already living in Cyprus.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-cyprus#coronavirus" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Cyprus.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Cyprus</a>.</p>

<p>Check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cyprus/entry-requirements">Cyprus travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re travelling to the north of Cyprus, their administration advises that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry to the north.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling to other EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. If you have citizenship of an EU or EFTA country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Cyprus using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>Cyprus is not part of the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a>. If you stay in Cyprus with a Cypriot residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day in 180 days visa-free limit in Cyprus or for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit countries in the Schengen area, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Cyprus before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your MEU or MUKW residence document or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of registration.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Cyprus, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Cyprus with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates o which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-cyprus">healthcare in Cyprus</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances. We strongly advise you take out private medical insurance if you are not eligible for state healthcare.</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study" class="govuk-link">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gesy.org.cy/" rel="external">the Cypriot government guidance on the healthcare system</a> (in Greek).</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>
