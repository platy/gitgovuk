</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to Cyprus</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cyprus/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Cyprus</a>  and the <a href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/page07_en/page07_en?OpenDocument" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Cypriot government guidance on visas</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>
<p>You should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Cyprus. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Cyprus, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a>, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Cyprus.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>
<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Cyprus.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Cyprus, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>Renew your passport before booking your travel. if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling to the north of Cyprus, their administration advises that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry to the north.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must be properly registered for healthcare as a resident in Cyprus, as well as registering, where necessary, with a health insurer.</p>

<p>Once you are registered as resident, you may be entitled to state healthcare. You should check with the Ministry of Health or at your local citizen service centre to see if you are covered.</p>

<p>You can find information about the new <a rel="external" href="https://www.gesy.org.cy/" class="govuk-link">Cypriot state healthcare system GESY on their website</a>. We strongly advise you to take out private medical insurance if you are not eligible for state healthcare.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-cyprus" class="govuk-link">guidance on who can access healthcare in Cyprus</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Cyprus temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-cyprus#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Cyprus before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Cyprus and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-cyprus#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on using an S1 form in Cyprus</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Cyprus, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC for healthcare in Cyprus.</p>

<p>If you were living in Cyprus before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Cyprus</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" rel="external">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a></p>

<p>An EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment are not covered. The EHIC is also not valid in north Cyprus.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Working in Cyprus</h2>
<p>If you were legally resident in Cyprus before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>If you are planning to come to Cyprus to work, you may need a visa. Read the <a rel="external" href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/CRMD/crmd.nsf/All/3970FC0B8741575AC2257D1F001EFF59?OpenDocument" class="govuk-link">Cypriot government’s guidance on how to get a visa</a>.</p>

<p>To apply for a job you may need to provide a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Cyprus and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country, before 1 January 2021 you may need a permit to show that you are a frontier worker.</p>

<h2>Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Cypriot nationals, as long as you were legally resident in Cyprus before 1 January 2021. Check that you are correctly registered for residency. 
Read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-students-in-the-eu-continuing-your-studies" class="govuk-link">continuing your studies in the EU</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-cyprus#studying-in-cyprus">healthcare for students in Cyprus</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>
<p>You may need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in Cyprus. When doing this, you will be subject to the third country regulations.</p>

<p>If your qualification was officially recognised by the relevant regulator in Cyprus before 1 January 2021, make sure you understand the terms of your recognition decision by checking with that regulator.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyprus-tax-treaties">double taxation agreement</a> with Cyprus to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Cyprus have not changed.</p>

<p>You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2>Pets</h2>
<p>If you have a pet passport issued by Cyprus or another EU member state, you can use it to travel with your pet to Great Britain and elsewhere in the EU.</p>

<p>A GB-issued EU pet passport is not valid for travel to the EU or Northern Ireland. You should speak to your vet before you travel to get the necessary pet travel documents and ensure you’re compliant with the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/pet-movement_en">EU Pet Travel Regulations</a>.</p>

<h2>Emergencies</h2>

<p>To move your pension to the UK, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension Centre</a>.</p>

<p>If you get healthcare in Cyprus through the S1 certificate, you must contact the Overseas Healthcare Team on +44 (0)191 218 1999 to make sure your S1 is cancelled at the right time.</p>
