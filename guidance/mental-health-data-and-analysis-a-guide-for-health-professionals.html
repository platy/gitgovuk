<p>The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) brings together and analyses data on mental health and wellbeing from across the health and care system, and produces resources to help improve services and outcomes.</p>

<p>This guidance is written for commissioners, public health professionals and others involved in the local planning and provision of services that support people with mental health conditions. It should support them to use these resources to make or influence decisions about local services.</p>

<h2>Understanding mental health locally using profiling tools</h2>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has created mental health profiling tools and guidance to help commissioners and other health professionals understand the mental health needs and services in their local area.</p>

<p>The tools bring together a wide range of publicly available data. The data is grouped by clinical commissioning group (<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>) or local authority. This means the tools can be used to benchmark one area against another. They can also be used to see trends and compare indicators.</p>

<h2>Population mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report">COVID-19: mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a> presents close to real time intelligence on the mental health and wellbeing of the population in England during the COVID-19 pandemic. It compiles routinely updated indicators from multiple sources and summarises important recent findings from a pre-defined set of studies. It aims to inform policy, planning and commissioning in health and social care and is designed to assist stakeholders at both national and local level.</p>

<p>The report is produced regularly and aims to include the latest available data and intelligence. It will enable the identification and consideration of changes in mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. The final version was published on 12 April 2022.</p>

<h2>Mental health and wellbeing: <abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr> toolkit</h2>

<p>Supports health and wellbeing boards and others interested in producing local mental health <abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessments">JSNAs</abbr>. It helps people to consider factors that affect mental health and wellbeing and to identify some of the key data, information and knowledge that local areas may use to build a picture of need.</p>

<p>The toolkit combines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile-group/mental-health/profile/mh-jsna" rel="external">mental health and wellbeing <abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr> (MHW <abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr>) profile</a> providing access to metrics on prevalence, risk and protective factors, and activity in and quality of support and care provision</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> has published an update to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/children-living-with-parents-in-emotional-distress-march-2021-update">4 indicators</a> on the proportion of children living with at least one parent reporting symptoms of emotional distress. Data is available for trends between the periods 2010 to 2020 and by family type and work status for the period 2019 to 2020. This data is published in a collaboration with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/about/statistics">Department of Work and Pensions</a> as part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/improving-lives-helping-workless-families-indicators-and-evidence-base">improving lives: helping workless families – indicators and evidence base</a>.</p>

<p>Guidance on how to use available information to assess and develop interventions which improve the mental wellbeing of children and young people is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measuring-the-mental-wellbeing-of-children-and-young-people">measuring mental wellbeing in children and young people briefing</a>.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The report is the first in a series of reports that analyses variation in premature mortality and excess premature mortality for adults with <abbr title="severe mental illness">SMI</abbr>. It is part of a wider programme of work seeking to better understand and effectively measure premature mortality in adults with <abbr title="severe mental illness">SMI</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/severe-mental-illness-smi-physical-health-inequalities">The severe mental illness and physical health inequalities report</a> uses a sample of primary care data to examine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the recorded prevalence of <abbr title="severe mental illness">SMI</abbr> by age, sex and deprivation in England</li>
  <li>the proportion of people with recorded <abbr title="severe mental illness">SMI</abbr> experiencing one or multiple physical health conditions in England</li>
  <li>inequalities in the co-morbidities and multi-morbidities between <abbr title="severe mental illness">SMI</abbr> and all patients by age, sex and deprivation in England</li>
