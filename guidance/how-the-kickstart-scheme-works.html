</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Kickstart Scheme provides funding to create new jobs for 16 to 24 year olds on Universal Credit who are at risk of long term unemployment. Employers of all sizes can apply for funding which covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates" class="govuk-link">National Minimum Wage</a> (or the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates" class="govuk-link">National Living Wage</a> depending on the age of the participant) for 25 hours per week for a total of 6 months</li>
  <li>associated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-rates-letters#employer-national-insurance-rates" class="govuk-link">employer National Insurance contributions</a>
</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers" rel="external">minimum automatic enrolment pension contributions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Employers can spread the job start dates up until 31 December 2021. You’ll get funding until 30 June 2022 if a young person starts their job on 31 December 2021.</p>

<p>Further funding is available to provide support so that young people on the scheme can get a job in the future.</p>

<h3>How to apply</h3>

<p>You can apply for a Kickstart Scheme grant by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applying online yourself</li>
  <li>applying through a Kickstart gateway who is already working with the Kickstart Scheme</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Find out how to sign in to manage your vacancies, get the young people into the jobs or manage your funding if you’ve already had a successful application.</p>
</div>

<h4>Applying online yourself</h4>

<p>You will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) with information about the jobs you’d like to offer</li>
  <li>have direct contact with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> about your application</li>
  <li>manage the funding yourself</li>
</ul>

<h4>Applying through a Kickstart gateway</h4>

<p>A Kickstart gateway can be any type of organisation, such as a local authority, charity or trade body.</p>

<p>They will act as an intermediary and apply for funding on your behalf.</p>

<p>They may also provide employability support to the young people in the job on your behalf.</p>

<p>Kickstart gateways will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gather information about the jobs you’d like to offer</li>
  <li>share this information with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on your behalf</li>
  <li>pay the funding to you</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/find-a-kickstart-gateway" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Find a Kickstart gateway</a>.</p>

<h4>Applying through a Gateway Plus</h4>

<p>A Gateway Plus is a specific type of Kickstart gateway. They can help smaller organisations, such as sole traders and partnerships, apply for a Kickstart Scheme grant.</p>

<p>Alongside the essential responsibilities of a Kickstart gateway, they will also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add the young person to their organisation’s payroll</li>
  <li>pay the young person’s wages on your behalf using the funding from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>provide the employability support on your behalf</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations that are approved to act as a Gateway Plus are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adecco Working Ventures in partnership with the Federation of Small Businesses</li>
  <li>REED in partnership with the British Chambers of Commerce</li>
  <li>Manpower Group</li>
  <li>The Wirral Chamber of Commerce</li>
</ul>

<p>Speak to your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/kickstart-scheme-employer-contacts/kickstart-scheme-employer-contacts" class="govuk-link">local or national Kickstart Scheme contact</a> about whether applying through a Gateway Plus is the right choice and the options available to you.</p>

<h2>What you’ll get</h2>

<h3>£1,500 per job</h3>

<p>You’ll get £1,500 funding per job. This should be spent on setup costs and supporting the young person to develop their employability skills.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>training and employability support (provided by you, a Kickstart gateway or another provider)</li>
  <li>IT equipment and software</li>
  <li>uniform or Personal Protective Equipment</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may ask you for your records to show that you’ve spent the funding on setup costs and supporting the young person’s employability.</p>

<h3>Kickstart Scheme wages and related costs</h3>

<p>The funding covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates" class="govuk-link">National Minimum Wage</a> (or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Living Wage</a> depending on the age of the participant) for 25 hours per week for a total of 6 months</li>
  <li>associated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-rates-letters#employer-national-insurance-rates">employer National Insurance contributions</a>
</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers">minimum automatic enrolment pension contributions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Employers can pay a higher wage and for more hours but the funding will not cover this.</p>

<h3>What the Kickstart gateway will get</h3>

<p>Kickstart gateways will get £360 for each job to cover admin costs. They may have to pay VAT on this amount depending on their individual circumstances.</p>

<p>If they do not pay VAT, £60 from this payment will be paid to you by the Kickstart gateway (in addition to the £1,500 funding for setup costs) to further support the young person.</p>

<h2>Job criteria</h2>

<p>The jobs created with Kickstart Scheme funding must be new jobs. They must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>replace existing or planned vacancies</li>
  <li>cause existing employees, apprentices or contractors to lose work or reduce their working hours</li>
</ul>

<p>The jobs must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a minimum of 25 hours per week, for 6 months</li>
  <li>pay at least the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage</a> for the employee’s age group</li>
  <li>only require basic training</li>
</ul>

<p>For each job you must help the young person become more employable. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>looking for long-term work, including career advice and setting goals</li>
  <li>support with curriculum vitae (<abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr>) and interview preparations</li>
  <li>developing their skills in the workplace</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not eligible for Kickstart Scheme funding, <a href="#other-schemes" class="govuk-link">find out about other employment schemes</a>.</p>

<p>The young person may be able to move to another employment scheme when they’ve finished their 6-month Kickstart Scheme job.</p>

<h2>Getting the young people into the jobs</h2>

<p>Kickstart Scheme jobs are only available for Universal Credit claimants aged 16 to 24 who are referred to you by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>If your application is successful:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You or your Kickstart gateway will give DWP job descriptions that work coaches at Jobcentre Plus will use to match candidates to the job placements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You or your Kickstart gateway will receive a ‘referral’ email each time a young person is referred to the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referred candidates may choose to apply for the job placement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll then be able to interview the candidates who have applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You or your Kickstart gateway will tell DWP when the young person has started so we can process the funding. You’ll be told how to do this in the ‘referral’ email.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can advertise vacancies yourself, but all jobs must receive an introduction through a DWP work coach to receive full funding.</p>
</div>

<p>After a job placement ends you can get another Kickstart Scheme young person to start another job placement.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If you apply online, you can sign in to manage your vacancies after you’ve made a successful application.</p>
</div>

<h2>How you will get the funding</h2>

<p>If you apply online, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will send the funding directly to you.</p>

<p>If you apply through a Kickstart gateway, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will send the funding to them. The Kickstart gateway will be responsible for sending the funding to you within 5 working days.</p>

<h3>Funding schedule</h3>

<p>The schedule shows when the funding will be sent to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you if you applied directly</li>
  <li>your gateway (they will then need to pass the funding on to you)</li>
</ul>
