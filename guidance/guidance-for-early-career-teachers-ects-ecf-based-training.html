<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>As an <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>, you are entitled to a 2-year programme of training and mentor support as part of your induction.</p>

<p>This package of training and support is known as ‘<abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training’ because it is based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-the-early-career-framework-ecf-supports-induction">early career framework (<abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>The framework sets out what you should learn, and learn how to do, during the 2 years of your induction. It is designed to develop your teaching knowledge, skills and working habits.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training is part of your 2-year induction</h2>

<p>You are entitled to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a 2-year programme of <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</li>
  <li>support from a dedicated mentor</li>
  <li>time off timetable for induction activities, including <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training and mentor sessions</li>
  <li>regular progress reviews and 2 formal assessments against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Your school may offer you extra training and support in addition to <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training, but not instead of <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training.</p>

<h2>You cannot fail your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h2>

<p><abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training is a professional development programme. It is not an assessment tool and you cannot fail any part of it.</p>

<p>You should engage with your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training as fully as possible, but failing to complete it will not mean you fail your induction.</p>

<h2>You do not need to collect evidence</h2>

<p>Your induction tutor may ask you to provide evidence of meeting the teachers’ standards during your formal assessments. This should only consist of existing documents, such as lesson plans or feedback from observations. There’s no need for you to create anything new for a formal assessment.</p>

<p>Following the assignments in your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training is one way to show that you meet the teachers’ standards, but you do not need to use your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training in this way.</p>

<h2>Starting your induction mid-term</h2>

<p>You can start your induction at any time. Your school will make sure your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training fits your circumstances.</p>

<h2>Working part-time or serving a reduced induction period</h2>

<p>If you work part-time, your headteacher will work with your induction tutor, appropriate body and training provider to arrange <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training and mentor support around your needs and schedule.</p>

<p>If you’re serving a reduced induction period, your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training programme can be adapted to suit your circumstances. You do not need to cover the full depth of the <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>.</p>

<h2>If you have difficulties or concerns</h2>

<p>Your induction tutor is the person responsible for <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> induction at your school. Speak to them first if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re struggling to engage with your training</li>
  <li>you have any concerns about your induction or statutory entitlements (time off timetable or mentor support)</li>
</ul>

<p>If they cannot help you, speak to your appropriate body. They’re responsible for making sure <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> receive their statutory entitlements and are fairly and consistently assessed. Your school should provide you with contact details for the right person to speak to.</p>

<h2>If you’re asked to register on <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s service</h2>

<p>If your school uses a training provider or accredited materials to deliver your <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training, we’ll need to confirm that you are eligible for funded training and materials.</p>

<p>When your school induction tutor tells us about your induction, you’ll get an email from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> asking you to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/participants/start-registration" rel="external">manage training for early career teachers service</a>
</li>
  <li>confirm the registration information your induction tutor has given us</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have to register, we’ll ask for your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>teacher reference number (<abbr title="teacher reference number">TRN</abbr>)</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to find your <abbr title="teacher reference number">TRN</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You can usually find your <abbr title="teacher reference number">TRN</abbr> on your payslip, teachers’ pension documents or teacher training records.</p>

<p>It’s a unique ID that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is usually 7 digits long, for example ‘4567814’</li>
  <li>may include the letters ‘RP’ or a slash ‘/’ symbol, for example ‘RP99/12345’</li>
  <li>may also be called a <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, <abbr title="General Teaching Council">GTC</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Education and Skills">DfES</abbr> or <abbr title="Department for Children, Schools and Families">DCSF</abbr> number</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll have a <abbr title="teacher reference number">TRN</abbr> if you hold, or are working towards, qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>) in England.</p>

<h3>What happens next</h3>

<p>We’ll check your details in the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) records to confirm your eligibility for funding.</p>

<p>You can then start or continue your training programme and receive access to training materials.</p>
