<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guide sets out essential information for British nationals residing in Uganda including advice on health, education, benefits, residence requirements and more. We are unable to provide any guidance on general lifestyle enquiries apart from the information and links listed below. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-kampala">our services</a> for more details of what the High Commission can do and cannot do to help. This information supplements the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda">travel advice for Uganda</a>.</p>

<p>Our publication <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British Nationals Abroad: A Guide</a> sets out the steps that British nationals can take to stay safe abroad, and provides details on what help the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) can provide if you do get into difficulty.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>You should follow the advice of Uganda’s government and your local authority. You can also read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/coronavirus">Uganda travel advice</a> for our latest guidance.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Uganda, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice.</a></p>

<h2>Health</h2>
<p>Medical standards are different in quality to the UK. Check the latest country-specific health advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries" rel="external">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> on the TravelHealthPro website. Each country-specific page has information on vaccine recommendations, any current health risks or outbreaks, and factsheets with information on staying healthy abroad.</p>

<p>Guidance is also available from NHS (Scotland) on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations.aspx" rel="external">FitForTravel website</a>. Malaria and Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) are common in Uganda. There are regular outbreaks of cholera in Uganda. You should follow the health advice issued by the National Travel Health Network and Centre <a class="govuk-link" href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/231/uganda#General_informationhttps://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/231/uganda" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>Medical facilities in Uganda are limited especially outside Kampala. Medical help at the scene of an accident is likely to be limited. In the case of serious accident or illness, evacuation by air ambulance may be required. You are strongly advised to take out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">adequate travel health insurance</a> before travelling to Uganda.</p>

<p>There are private medical facilities especially in the capital city, which provide adequate health care but may be expensive. The government owned hospitals are free but may be overcrowded and sometimes have shortages of basic medicine. There are some British doctors working in private clinics or hospitals, several of which are well equipped.</p>

<p>See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda">travel advice</a> sections on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/health">health</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda/safety-and-security">safety and security</a>.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>Most schools in Uganda teach in English. English is widely spoken and understood by most people. The majority of international schools are located in the capital, Kampala. Some of these offer the British educational curriculum while others offer the American curriculum. International schools are more expensive. Most primary schools usually start formal teaching from Grade 1 at six years old. Universal free education is only available for Ugandan nationals aged 6 to 16 years. There are many fee-paying private schools and entry is subject to registration and tuition fees, which can be expensive.</p>

<p>For further information, visit <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.education.go.ug/" rel="external">website of the Ministry of Education &amp; Sports</a>.</p>

<h2>Employment and recognised qualifications</h2>

<p>Employment opportunities are available for British nationals. However, you require a valid work permit to work in Uganda. You may also be required to provide a police clearance /disclosure from your home country and/or from Uganda before receiving a work permit. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://immigration.go.ug/" rel="external">Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control</a> handles all work permit applications. Arrangements for applying for work permits should be made prior to entering the country.</p>

<p>The Uganda Police Force issue Certificates of Good Conduct, you can find details of how to on their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.upf.go.ug/certificate-of-good-conduct-fees-adjusted/" rel="external">website</a>.</p>

<h2>Entry and residence requirements</h2>

<p>British nationals need a visa to enter Uganda, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://visas.immigration.go.ug/" rel="external">apply online for an ‘e-visa’</a>.</p>

<p>Ugandan immigration officers decide how long tourists are permitted to stay in Uganda when they enter the country. This is usually between 2 weeks and 3 months. You can be fined and/or imprisoned for overstaying your visa. You can apply to extend the period of your stay at your nearest immigration office. Ugandan immigration headquarters is on Plot 75 Jinja Road.</p>

<p>For further information about entry requirements, visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.mia.go.ug/" rel="external">Ugandan Ministry of Internal Affairs</a> website or email them at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@mia.go.ug">info@mia.go.ug</a>. If you’re arriving by road, it’s usually easier to get a visa before you travel.</p>

<p>Foreign nationals can apply for Residence status after legally living in Uganda for 10 years. Uganda recognises dual citizenship but you must apply for it. There are restrictions on children below 18 having dual citizenship.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>There is no benefit system in Uganda. British nationals do not get benefits and cannot access UK benefits through the Ugandan authorities. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/benefits-if-you-are-abroad">UK benefits</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">advice on retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Social security pensions are available for locals only and Foreign nationals who have made contributions to the National Social Security Fund and meet certain requirements. For more information, visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nssfug.org/" rel="external">National Social Security Fund website</a>.</p>

<h2>Driving Licences and Vehicles</h2>
<p>You can drive in Uganda using a UK driving licence for up to 3 months, after which you will need to get a Ugandan driving licence from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ura.go.ug/index.jsp" rel="external">Uganda Revenue Authority</a>.</p>

<p>The British High Commission cannot issue or renew a UK driving licence. Contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence">DVLA</a> for information about renewing a licence or applying for a new licence.</p>

<p>Uganda being a former British colony and part of the Commonwealth, driving is on the left and the traffic code and traffic laws are mostly the same as in the UK. Care should be taken as driving standards are not the same as in the UK. In some areas, poorly lit roads can cause accidents. People tend to drive carelessly and sometimes do not respect the speed limits.</p>

<h2>Finance</h2>
<p>Traveller’s cheques, international credit cards and debit cards are not widely accepted. Do check with lodges and restaurants in advance, if you plan to pay by credit cards.</p>

<p>We therefore advise you to bring cash and have money changed upon arrival in Uganda. US dollars, British pounds and Euros are easy to change. However, for some expenses, like the payment of a tourist visa at the airport/border, it is easier to have dollars available. It is often possible to pay for tourist activities with US dollars.</p>

<h2>Guidance on bringing medication into Uganda</h2>
<p>If you are on a prescription for any form of medication you should ensure you have a supply of it available, or are able to obtain it once in Uganda. Certain medicines may not be available in Uganda (including major brands readily available in the UK), and may be prohibited from entering the country. You should consult your GP before travelling to Uganda to learn of any alternatives which may be available.</p>

<p>Contact the Ministry of Health on  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@health.go.ug">info@health.go.ug</a> for details on which medicines can be brought into Uganda.</p>

<h2>Sponsoring Family Members</h2>
<p>Family members of a British National need a valid relevant visa to live in Uganda. This is not required if the family members hold Ugandan nationality.</p>

<h2>Social Ethics and Traditions</h2>
<p>Ugandans are friendly to visitors. English is the official language and is widely spoken. The dress code is sometimes conservative. Remember to be sensitive to the different culture and people around you. Do not engage in behaviour that may cause offence. Homosexual activity is illegal and not tolerated in Uganda’s conservative society. Public displays of homosexuality like kissing in public places could lead to arrest and imprisonment.</p>

<h2>Returning to the UK</h2>
<p>At the end of your stay you should check that your visa/residence permit is valid or you will be liable to pay a fine to the Immigration Department. You may be required to provide a Police Certificate / Certificate of Good Conduct in your next location. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.upf.go.ug/certificate-of-good-conduct-fees-adjusted/" rel="external">Ugandan Police Force website</a> to know how to apply.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This information is provided as a general guide and is based upon information provided to the High Commission by the relevant local authorities and may be subject to change at any time with little or no notice. The FCDO and the British High Commission will not be liable for any inaccuracies in this information. British nationals wishing to obtain any further information must contact the relevant local authority.</p>
