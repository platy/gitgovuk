<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get healthcare in the Netherlands.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-netherlands" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This information is about living in the Netherlands. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance about visiting the Netherlands.</a></p>

<p>You must have health insurance cover to live in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>You have to pay for your medical care up to a fixed limit.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Dutch healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taking out insurance with a Dutch health insurance provider</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with the health insurance fund called ‘CZ’</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in the Netherlands</h2>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-netherlands">register as a resident</a> if you’re living in the Netherlands for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>You need to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.zorgverzekering.org/eng/">find a health insurance scheme to join</a>.</p>

<p>You must get health insurance within 4 months of arriving. If you do not do this, you could be fined more than 400 euros.</p>

<p>There are around 60 health insurance providers that you can take out insurance with. You pay a premium each month.</p>

<p>If you’re employed in the Netherlands, your employer may offer you a discount with its chosen  health insurance.
You can add your dependants to your insurance plan.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Dutch <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>First, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-netherlands#visas-and-residency">register as a resident</a>.</p>

<p>Then contact your chosen insurance provider directly.</p>

<p>You’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your citizen service number (burgerservicenummer)</li>
  <li>proof of your address, by registering in the Personal Records Database (Basisregistratie Personen)</li>
  <li>proof that you have a Dutch bank account</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve registered with an insurance provider you can register with a GP.</p>

<p>You’ll be given a health insurance card. Show this card and your ID when you register with a doctor.</p>

<p>You’ll also be entitled to a Dutch <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. Request this from your chosen insurance provider.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>You’ll pay around 100 euros a month for your insurance premium.</p>

<p>Emergency care is included in your policy.</p>

<p>Some medical care is free, for example GP appointments and maternity care.</p>

<p>You’ll need to pay for other medical care, but you will not have to pay more than your insurance excess that year, which is usually around 400 euros.</p>

<p>The excess is set by the government each year. You can increase your excess and pay a lower monthly premium.</p>

<p>There’s no fixed cost for prescription medicines. It depends on the medicine and where you buy it.</p>

<p>You can take out extra insurance on top of the basic level insurance to cover things that are not usually covered, such as dentistry and physiotherapy.</p>

<p>If you have treatment in a hospital not covered by your insurance policy, you usually have to pay 25% of the cost.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to the Netherlands temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in the Netherlands using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, GHIC or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. This can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in the Netherlands</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-the-netherlands">resident in the Netherlands</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register with the Dutch insurance provider CZ.</p>

<p>This shows that you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in the Netherlands on the same basis as a Dutch citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in the Netherlands than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the insurance provider CZ when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in the Netherlands</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 form with the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.cz.nl/en/health-insurance">insurance provider CZ</a>. This is the only insurance provider that deals with S1 forms.</p>

<p>Once registered, you will be issued with a CZ insurance card. This will mean you’re entitled to healthcare in the Netherlands on the same basis as a Dutch citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in the Netherlands</h2>
<p>You can use an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/" rel="external"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC</a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<p>If you work, intern or volunteer alongside your studies, you need to pay for Dutch health insurance.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
