<h2>If you’re clinically extremely vulnerable</h2>

<p>If you’re <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#cev">clinically extremely vulnerable</a> you’re no longer advised to shield. You’ll have received a letter with this advice.</p>

<p>We still recommend that you take extra precautions to protect yourself while the virus is still spreading. Read the guidance if you’re <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#cev" class="govuk-link">clinically extremely vulnerable</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve previously registered for priority access to supermarket delivery slots you’ll keep this access until 21 June 2021. You do not need to re-register.</p>

<h2>If you’re having difficulty shopping</h2>

<p>Follow this guidance if you’re having difficulty shopping because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re vulnerable</li>
  <li>you have a disability that makes social distancing more difficult</li>
  <li>the support services you usually rely on are not available during the pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">contact your local authority</a> to find out what support services are available in your area.</p>

<p>If you can, ask friends, family or neighbours to go out and get food and other essentials for you. Supermarkets and other food shops will remain open during all stages of the roadmap out of the current lockdown.</p>

<p>If you do not have others to help you, there may be charities or community groups who can help in your area or your local shops, markets and wholesalers may offer a delivery service (by phone or by email).</p>

<p>If someone is shopping for you, most of the major supermarkets have alternative ways you can pay for your shopping, such as e-vouchers or gift cards. You can buy these online and the person shopping for you can use them in store. To find out about payment options, visit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your supermarket’s website or call their customer helpline</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/covid-19-making-payments-safely-lockdown-interactive-tool" rel="external">UK Finance</a> (the collective voice for the banking and finance industry)</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also be eligible for support from the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/services">NHS Volunteer Responders programme</a>. You can call 0808 196 3646 and ask for help to pick up food, prescriptions and essential items.</p>

<h2>If you’re not able to leave home because you’re self-isolating</h2>

<p>The <a href="#difficulty-shopping" class="govuk-link">guidance for if you’re having difficulty shopping</a> also applies if you’re self-isolating because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you or someone in your household has symptoms, or you’ve been contacted by NHS Test and Trace</li>
  <li>you have recently returned to the UK after travelling overseas</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">contact your local authority</a> to seek urgent help to access food.</p>

<h2>If you’re able to leave your home and are not self-isolating</h2>

<p>Supermarkets and other food retailers remain open and you can shop for food and other essentials in person unless you are self-isolating.</p>

<p>Supermarkets have increased the number of delivery slots available in order to meet demand during the pandemic. They are continuing to work with government to prioritise access to online delivery slots for the vulnerable, and are disinfecting trolleys and baskets to protect you.</p>

<p>If you need to go to the supermarket, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shop alone where possible, as this will reduce the number of contact points between people</li>
  <li>follow social distancing guidance in store - this means staying more than 2 metres from people you don’t live with (unless you have formed a support or childcare bubble with them)</li>
  <li>wash your hands before and after visiting stores</li>
  <li>wear a face covering over both your nose and mouth at all times, unless you have an exemption - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">read guidance on making and wearing a face covering</a>
</li>
  <li>follow markings and advice in stores</li>
  <li>try to plan what your household and anyone you are supporting needs for a number of days ahead so that your trips to buy food and essentials are as infrequent as possible</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shopping for others</h2>

<p>Consider offering to shop for people you know who are self-isolating or more vulnerable and unable to get to the shops.</p>

<p>If you’ve <a rel="external" href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/i-want-to-volunteer" class="govuk-link">signed up for the NHS Volunteer Responders programme</a>, you can volunteer to support others in your community as well as family and friends.</p>

<p>If you’re shopping for someone else, most of the major supermarkets have ways that you can <a href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/community-response-volunteer/fact-sheet-community-response-payment-options" rel="external" class="govuk-link">pay on behalf of others</a>, such as e-vouchers and gift cards. The person you’re shopping for can buy these online and you can use them in store. Local convenience stores may also have options available so check what is on offer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-how-to-help-safely--2" class="govuk-link">Read the guidance on helping others safely</a>.</p>

<p>Find out about the different ways to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/volunteering/coronavirus-volunteering">volunteer during the coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>Wherever you live, you may be able to get financial help.</p>
