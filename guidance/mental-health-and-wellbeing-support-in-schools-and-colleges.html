<h2>Whole school or college approaches to mental health and wellbeing</h2>

<p>Taking a coordinated and evidence-informed approach to mental health and wellbeing in schools and colleges leads to improved pupil and student emotional health and wellbeing. This can help with their learning.</p>

<p>The publication outlining a whole school or college approach was updated for autumn 2021 by Public Health England (PHE) and the Department for Education. This describes the areas to consider to enable good mental health and wellbeing practice.</p>

<h2>Before you start developing your approach</h2>

<p>You will find it helpful if you first understand how your pre-existing statutory responsibilities on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">SEND code of practice</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">safeguarding</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mental-health-and-wellbeing-support-in-schools-and-colleges#RHSE"><abbr title="Relationship, Health &amp; Sex Education">RHSE</abbr> curriculum</a> relate to mental health and wellbeing, and how they can support the development of your whole school or college approach.</p>

<h2>Senior mental health leads training</h2>

<p>The Department for Education is encouraging schools and colleges to identify a senior mental health lead, who will have a strategic oversight of their settings’ whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>School and college staff are not expected to, and should not, diagnose mental health conditions or perform mental health interventions.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>Senior lead training gives senior leaders the knowledge and skills they’ll need to develop an effective whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>This programme will help you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use your existing resources more effectively</li>
  <li>promote good mental health and wellbeing in your setting</li>
  <li>quickly identify individual pupils or students who need support with their mental health</li>
  <li>work effectively with local children and young people’s mental health services, including <a class="govuk-link" href="#MHSTs">Mental Health Support Teams</a> where they are established</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>State-funded schools and colleges in England, including those in receipt of ESFA pre-16 revenue, high needs block, or 16 to 19 programme funding, are eligible to apply for a grant. Further information on eligible setting types is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-mental-health-lead-training-grant-funding/senior-mental-health-lead-training-conditions-of-grant-for-the-2022-to-2023-financial-year#eligible-settings">conditions of grant</a>.</p>

<p>Independent settings with fee-paying pupils and students are not eligible for a grant but may access <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> assured training independently.</p>

<p>Settings that claimed a grant in the 2021 to 2022 financial year are not eligible to apply for further funding.</p>

<p>Senior mental health lead training is not intended to help meet the specific needs of children and young people in early years or settings with learners over 18 years old.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>Up to two thirds of all eligible schools and colleges in England will have the opportunity to benefit from a grant to access quality assured senior mental health lead training by the end of financial year 2022-23. Between October 2021 and March 2022, over 8000 schools and colleges claimed a training grant, including over 1 in 3 primary schools and colleges, and over half of secondary schools.</p>

<p>Settings ready to further develop or introduce their whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing, with capacity to commence training before March 2023, are now encouraged to consult the guidance and arrange training.</p>

<p>We aim to provide the opportunity for all state schools and colleges to access the training by 2025.</p>

<h3>Get more information</h3>

<p>Senior mental health leads can now search for and book a training course. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/senior-mental-health-lead-training">Senior mental health lead training</a> provides further information on how you can do this.</p>

<h2>Mental Health Support Teams (MHSTs)</h2>

<p>Mental Health Support Teams (MHSTs) is a new service designed to help meet the mental health needs of children and young people in primary, secondary and further education (primarily for ages 5 to 18), by providing mental health support in schools, colleges and other education settings, such as alternative provision.</p>

<p>By 2023, nearly 500 mental health support teams will be working with and in schools and colleges attended by almost 3 million pupils in England. This will surpass commitments set out in the 2017 mental health green paper.</p>

<h3>Who is it for</h3>

<p>Schools and colleges in participating areas selected to receive additional mental health and wellbeing support and extra capacity for early intervention and help for mild to moderate mental health issues.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>Only certain local areas will be participating in this programme and decisions on which schools and colleges are selected are made locally. The approach to working with schools and colleges will be determined by each <abbr title="Mental Health Support Teams">MHST</abbr> site with their education partners, including the local authority, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Improvement and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> regional leads and integrated community systems.</p>

<p>MHSTs are designed to support all types of education settings but support is being targeted in the areas where there is greatest need alongside the ability to establish the teams effectively. Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/mental-health/cyp/trailblazers/mh-support-teams/2019-20-mental-health-support-teams/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> website</a> to find out more.</p>

<ul>
  <li>deliver evidence-based interventions for mild to moderate mental health issues</li>
  <li>support your senior mental health lead to develop, or introduce, a whole school or college approach</li>
  <li>give timely advice to school and college staff, and liaise with external specialist services, to help children and young people get the right support and stay in education</li>
