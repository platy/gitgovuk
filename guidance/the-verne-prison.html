<h2>Book and plan your visit to The Verne</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>HMP The Verne is offering visits for family and friends. Visiting times and availability may change at short notice. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact the prison direct for any queries</a>.</p>

<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in The Verne you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-the-verne">required <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr></a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit.</p>

<p>There may be a limit to the number of visits a person can have. You can check this with The Verne.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact The Verne</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

<h3>Help with the cost of your visit</h3>
<p>If you get certain benefits or have an NHS health certificate, you might be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help-with-prison-visits">get help with the costs of your visit</a>, including:</p>

<ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p>The Verne has limited parking for visitors, including space for Blue Badge holders.</p>

<h3>Entering The Verne</h3>
<p>All visitors over 18 must bring the required <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr>.</p>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  Read the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">acceptable forms of <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by a security dog and have your fingerprints and photograph taken.</p>

<p>The Verne has a family-friendly dress code which means visitors should dress appropriately. You may be turned away if you are wearing items like vests, low-cut tops, high-cut shorts or dresses or ripped jeans. Additionally, you cannot wear flip-flops and all hoods must be worn down. You will need to remove coats, scarves, gloves and hats (except religious head coverings) before you go in.</p>

<p>Each adult visitor is allowed to take in a maximum of £10 in coins (notes are not allowed). The money can be used to buy food and drink from the vending machines in the visiting hall.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into The Verne. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker (which requires a £1 coin) or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at The Verne</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at The Verne.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in The Verne using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at The Verne.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact The Verne</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Family and friends can hand in books and legal documents for prisoners before a visit.</p>

<p>Other items may be accepted by post but you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">write to the governor</a> for permission beforehand. If you don’t do this, your parcel will be returned.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>Books may be sent directly to loved ones, or can be ordered from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Life at The Verne</h2>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>
<p>When a prisoner first arrives at The Verne, they will be able to contact a family member by phone. This could be quite late in the evening, depending on the time they arrive.</p>

<p>They will get to speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone also finds out about the rules, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Nearly 600 men live at The Verne across 6 units. Each unit has its own common room and dining area. Prisoners have keys to their own rooms.</p>

<p>Prisoners have access to a library, operated by Dorset County Council, which includes books in multiple languages and a variety of magazines and newspapers.</p>

<p>There is also a well-equipped gym, fitness and sports programme.</p>

<p>The Verne operates a full education programme provided by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.weston.ac.uk/" rel="external">Weston College</a>, with links to the Open University for distance learning courses.</p>

<p>There is also a wide range of work opportunities for prisoners throughout the prison, such as in the kitchens, gardens, recycling centre and barbers. Men can work as wing assistants, wing peer support workers and orderlies. There are also roles within The Verne’s woodmill, assembling furniture, and in The Verne’s 4 contract workshops which cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating breakfast packs for other prisons</li>
  <li>repairing televisions</li>
