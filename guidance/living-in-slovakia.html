<h2>If you were living in Slovakia before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Slovakia since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Slovak Government and your local authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/slovakia">Slovakia travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as aâ€¯UKâ€¯national in Slovakia readâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/slovakia/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check theâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/slovakia/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Slovakia</a>â€¯and read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mic.iom.sk/en/" rel="external">IOM Migration Information Centreâ€™s guidance on visas and residency</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Slovakia, you must always carry and show both your valid passport (as a proof of identity) and your valid residence permit.  Police officers may ask to see them.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Slovakia before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you have lived in Slovakia since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have rights under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>If you have an EU residence card (Pobytovy Preukaz Obcana EU) it is no longer valid, regardless of its expiry date. You need a new residence document (Povolenie na pobyt) instead.</p>

<p>The Povolenie na pobyt shows that you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. It also shows your right to enter Slovakia, and exempts you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<p>The deadline for applying for the Povolenie na pobyt was 30 June 2021. You will not have to pay a fine if you apply after this date, but your non-EU family members may need to. Your rights and your non-EU family membersâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement will not be affected by a late application.</p>

</ul>

<p>If you need additional support to obtain your residency document, contact your local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.minv.sk/?the-units-of-foreign-police-of-the-police-force" rel="external">Foreigners Police office</a>.</p>

<h3>If you have a Withdrawal Agreement residence card issued in 2020</h3>

<p>If your Withdrawal Agreement residence card was issued in 2020, you should have received a letter from the Slovak Foreigners Police about updating it. Although your card remains valid, you should apply for the 2021 updated version of the Withdrawal Agreement residence card (Povolenie na pobyt). This 2021 version has â€˜Clanok 50 ZEUâ€™ in the â€˜type of permitâ€™ field. Having the 2021 version of the card will minimize potential delays and inconvenience when crossing a Schengen border control. You can also use it in another EU country to prove that you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement in Slovakia.</p>

<p>To get the 2021 version of the Povolenie na pobyt residence card, book an appointment online with your local Foreigners Police Office and take with you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your valid passport</li>
  <li>your residence card</li>
  <li>a copy of the letter from the Foreigners Police, if you have it</li>
</ul>

<p>If your Povolenie na pobyt residence card was issued in 2021, and you have not received a letter from the Foreigners Police, your card is already in the correct format. You do not need to take any action.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Slovakia at any point in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>They must travel to Slovakia and then apply as your family member. Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Slovak authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Slovakia.</p>

<p>You canâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Slovakia</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/slovakia/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Slovakia travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA country), in addition to British citizenship, you should enter and leave Slovakia using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Slovakia with a Slovak residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Slovakia, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.â€¯</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™sâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a>â€¯for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Slovakia before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your residence document (Povolenie na pobyt) or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of registration.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Slovakia, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Slovakia with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-slovakia">guidance on healthcare in Slovakia</a> and make sure you are correctly insured for your circumstances.</p>

</ul>

<p>Your employer will pay contributions to your health insurance on your behalf.</p>
