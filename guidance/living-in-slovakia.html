<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Slovakia before 1 January 2021, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not you may have to pay a fine, but your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement will not be affected. If you have an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Residence Card, it will become invalid after 30 June 2021, regardless of the card’s expiry date.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/slovakia/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Slovakia</a> and read the <a href="https://www.minv.sk/?information-on-the-stay-in-the-territory-of-the-slovak-republic-in-connection-with-the-withdrawal-of-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-from-the-european-union-brexit" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Slovak Ministry of Interior guidance residence permits</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Additional support</h3>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals who are resident in Slovakia, and need help to complete their residence application or registration, can get support from organisations funded by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-allocates-3-million-to-support-uk-nationals-in-the-eu"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Nationals Support Fund</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence card (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency card or non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> card), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied for a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> card but not yet received it, you can carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence card, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Slovakia. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Slovakia, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Slovakia.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Slovakia.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Slovakia, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>
<p>You can travel to other <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer, than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your the 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>Health insurance is compulsory in Slovakia and there are 3 insurance companies you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Union zdravotná poisťovňa</li>
  <li>Dôvera zdravotná poisťovňa</li>
  <li>Všeobecná zdravotná poisťovňa</li>
</ul>

<p>Your employer will pay contributions to your health insurance on your behalf.</p>

<p>You need to take your insurance card when visiting a doctor.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-slovakia" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare in Slovakia</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> employer has sent you to Slovakia temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-slovakia#posted-worker">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Slovakia before 1 January, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Slovakia and commutes to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-slovakia#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Slovakia</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Slovakia, you must not use your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for healthcare in Slovakia.</p>

<p>If you were living in Slovakia before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> student in Slovakia</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" class="govuk-link">Apply now for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h2>Working in Slovakia</h2>
<p>If you were legally resident in Slovakia before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>You should ensure you have applied for a new Third Country (non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) residence card by 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer must notify the local labour office within 7 working days of you starting your job.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Slovakia and were regularly commuting to work in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or EFTA country before 1 January 2021, you may need a permit to show you are a frontier worker. You must also apply for a residence card in Slovakia.</p>

<p>If you live in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or EFTA country and regularly commuted to work in Slovakia before 1 January 2021, you do not need a frontier worker permit. However, you can request one if you wish.</p>
