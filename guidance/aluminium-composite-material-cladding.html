<h2>Advice for building owners</h2>

<p>Shortly after the fire at Grenfell Tower, the independent expert advisory panel advised the government to undertake identification screening of residential buildings over 18 metres tall (in accordance with building regulations guidance on rain-screen cladding). This is in order to identify the type of aluminium composite material (<abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr>) used.</p>

<p>Those checking tests began at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bregroup.com/" rel="external">Building Research Establishment (<abbr title="Building Research Establishment">BRE</abbr>)</a> the following week.</p>

<p>On 6 July 2017, having also spoken to a group of technical experts from a wide range of professions and organisations, the expert panel recommended further large scale testing of cladding systems. This was to better understand better how different types of <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> panels behave with different types of insulation in a fire (these tests can be used to show compliance with the building regulations guidance).</p>

<p>These large scale tests, undertaken by the <abbr title="Building Research Establishment">BRE</abbr>, looked at 3 different types of <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> cladding combined with different types of insulation, in accordance with British Standard 8414. This involved building a 9-metre high demonstration wall with a complete cladding system fixed to it - including panels and insulation. This was then subjected to a fire designed to replicate the circumstances in which a severe fire breaks out of a window. The spreads of the fire up the outside wall, if any, was then monitored.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-programme-update-and-consolidated-advice-for-building-owners-following-large-scale-testing">final consolidated advice</a> after all the tests.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-industry-group-to-ensure-construction-sector-ready-to-meet-building-challenges-after-grenfell-tower">Industry Response Group</a> was established by government in June 2017 to advise on immediate steps to ensure building safety. It complements the work of the Expert Panel.</p>

<p>In consultation with the Industry Response Group, independent expert advisory panel, building owners, and other experts, the government has developed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-programme#information-note-for-building-owners">an information note</a> to assist building owners in considering what measures to take to make buildings safe - and how they could carry out remedial works on high rise residential buildings with <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> cladding.</p>

<h2>Information note for building owners</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Information note 1 - Information note for landlords and building owners of tall residential buildings with ACM cladding
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Action for private sector residential landlords</h2>

<p>It is the responsibility of building owners in the private residential sector to carry out necessary measures to ensure the safety of their residents.</p>

<p>Since June, the government has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safety-checks-on-private-residential-blocks">been urging owners of private residential buildings</a> over 18 metres to make urgent use of the free <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safety-checks-on-private-residential-blocks"><abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> screening tests</a>, and to report the results to local authorities so that private sector blocks with <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> cladding systems can be identified.</p>

<p>We are also working with local authorities to identify privately owned residential buildings over 18 metres with <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> cladding systems. Financial support to local authorities for the work needed to collect data on high rise residential buildings and report on cladding was provided in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-burdens-doctrine-guidance-for-government-departments">new burdens doctrine</a>.</p>

<p>Work to reach private sector landlords <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-from-tamara-finkelstein-19-october-2017">continues</a> - through industry bodies including the Home Builders Federation, Association of Residential Letting Agents, and the British Property Federation.</p>

<h2>Private sector <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> cladding remediation fund</h2>

<p>On 9 May 2019 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-fund-and-speed-up-vital-cladding-replacement">Secretary of State announced</a> that the government will fully fund the removal and replacement of unsafe <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> cladding on private sector residential buildings 18 metres or over, with costs estimated at £200 million.</p>

<p>See further detail on how responsible entities can apply to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/private-sector-acm-cladding-remediation-fund-prospectus">private sector <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> cladding remediation fund</a>.</p>

<h2>Corporate entities yet to start remediation works on site</h2>

<p>This is a list of corporate entities that have indicated to the department that they are responsible for the remediation of unsafe aluminium composite material (<abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr>) cladding, but where remediation works have not started on at least one of their buildings.</p>

<p>The entities are the department’s main contact for the remediation of a specific building, or we understand that they are the decision makers on remediation (though they may have other entities working on their behalf).</p>

<p>Entities are excluded from this list if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it would lead to the identification of a specific building with unsafe <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> cladding</li>
  <li>the entity is awaiting further advice from public authorities about the remediation of unsafe <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> cladding; or</li>
  <li>where those responsible for remediation are in administration or the building is vacant</li>
</ul>

<h2>2017 <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> fire test reports</h2>

<p>Following the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017, the government commissioned a series of large scale fire tests of Aluminium Composite Material (<abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr>) cladding. These were intended to establish how different types of <abbr title="aluminium composite material">ACM</abbr> panels in combination with different types of insulation behave in a fire.</p>
