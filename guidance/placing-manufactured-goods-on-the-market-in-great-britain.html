<p>This guidance is about placing manufactured goods on the market in Great Britain (GB). Great Britain is England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>There’s different guidance if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-eu-market">placing manufactured goods on the EU market</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-market-in-northern-ireland" class="govuk-link">placing manufactured goods on the market in Northern Ireland</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If you placed goods on the UK market (or in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> state) before 1 January 2021, you do not need to do anything for these individual goods.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>EEA states include any country in the EU, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</p>
</div>

<p>They can continue to circulate on either market until they reach their end user and do not need to comply with the changes that took effect from 1 January 2021. This guidance explains what you need to do for any goods you’re placing on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market after 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>A fully manufactured good is ‘placed on the market’ when a written or verbal agreement (or offer of an agreement) to transfer ownership or possession or other property rights in the product is exchanged.</p>

<p>‘Placing a good on the market’ means each individual good, not a type of good. It does not require the physical transfer of the good.</p>

<p>You can usually provide proof of placing on the market on the basis of any relevant document ordinarily used in business transactions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contracts of sale concerning goods which have already been manufactured and meet the legal requirements</li>
  <li>invoices</li>
  <li>documents concerning the shipping of goods for distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant economic operator (whether manufacturer, importer or distributor) bears the burden of proof for demonstrating that the good was placed on the market before 1 January 2021.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Businesses are encouraged to be ready for full implementation of the new UK regime as soon as possible. However, to allow businesses time to adjust, CE marked goods in scope of this guidance that meet EU requirements (where these match UK requirements) can continue to be placed on the GB market until 1 January 2022 where EU and UK requirements remain the same. This includes goods which have been assessed by an EU recognised notified body.</p>

<p>You will still need to take action to ensure you comply with new importer responsibilities if you are placing a product on the GB market from the EU market.</p>
</div>

<h2>Check which rules apply</h2>

<p>What you need to do depends on the type of goods you’re placing on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market.</p>

<p>Most of this page covers goods subject to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukca-marking" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</a>.</p>

<p>There are different rules for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods regulated under the old approach</li>
  <li>goods covered by national rules (non-harmonised)</li>
  <li>certain other <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr>-marked goods, such as medical devices and civil explosives</li>
</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Check the sector specific legislation that applies to your goods. You can speak to your solicitor or trade association if you are unsure which regulatory framework applies to your goods.</p>
</div>

<h3>Old approach goods</h3>

<p>You must follow different rules if you’re placing the following goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/brexit/chemicals-brexit-guidance.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">chemicals</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/mhra-post-transition-period-information" class="govuk-link">medicines</a></li>

  <li><a rel="external" href="https://info.caa.co.uk/brexit/" class="govuk-link">aerospace</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Goods covered by national rules (non-harmonised)</h3>

<p>You must make sure that your goods meet UK rules. You’ll need to do this even if they were previously sold in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-safety-for-businesses-a-to-z-of-industry-guidance" class="govuk-link">UK product safety rules</a> to find out what you need to do.</p>

<h3>Other goods</h3>

<p>There are also special rules if you’re placing the following goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Check if you need to change your conformity assessment or marking</h2>

<p>You need to use a conformity marking if you’re placing certain goods on the UK market. Before 1 January 2021 you could do this using the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> or other appropriate marking (such as the wheel marking or Pi marking).
The <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking is the conformity assessment marking for Great Britain for most goods previously subject to <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>.</p>

<p>Goods that are lawfully <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked will be accepted in the UK until 1 January 2022 for <a href="#legislation" class="govuk-link">certain goods</a>. You must be ready to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking from 1 January 2022 at the latest, although you should look to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you’re a Northern Ireland business, you can place qualifying Northern Ireland goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market with an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> conformity assessment marking, such as the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>.</p>

<p>The table below illustrates the accepted markings on each relevant market.</p>

<h3>Using the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h3>

<p>You only need to use the new <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking before 1 January 2022 if all of the following apply. Your product:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is covered by <a href="#legislation" class="govuk-link">legislation which requires the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</a>
</li>
  <li>requires mandatory third-party conformity assessment</li>
  <li>conformity assessment has been carried out by a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-conformity-assessment" class="govuk-link">UK conformity assessment body</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This does not apply to existing stock. For example, if your good was fully manufactured, <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked and ready to place on the market before 1 January 2021, you do not need to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking even if the certification was carried out by a UK-based body. These goods will only be able to be placed on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market and only until 31 December 2021. From 1 January 2022, you will need to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking.</p>

<p>These products are not allowed to be placed on the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> market. For goods where mandatory assessment has been done by a UK body, the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> must be followed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukni-marking">UKNI marking for goods being placed on the NI market</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Contact your solicitor or trade association for advice on whether your good will be affected.</p>

<h4>Mandatory third-party conformity assessment for the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h4>

<p>Where mandatory third-party conformity assessment was required for <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked goods, it is also required for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marked goods.</p>

<p>This conformity assessment needs to be carried out by a UK-recognised conformity assessment body in order to be marked with the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking. The type of conformity assessment procedures are the same that were required for the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-market-conformity-assessment-bodies" class="govuk-link">The UK Market Conformity Assessment Bodies (UKMCAB) database</a> lists all bodies which can provide conformity assessment for the UK market.</p>

<p>Where self-declaration of conformity is permitted for <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> this is also the case for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking.</p>

<h3>Using the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> for the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market</h4>

<p>You will be able to use the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> until 31 December 2021 if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you currently apply the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> to your good on the basis of self-declaration</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-recognised notified body (including a body in a country with which the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has a relevant mutual recognition agreement)</li>
  <li>the certificate of conformity previously held by a UK approved body has been transferred to an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-recognised notified body prior to 1 January 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only place <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked goods that meet <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements on the market in Great Britain while UK and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements are the same. This is currently the case and there are no UK plans to diverge at this time.</p>

<p>Nonetheless you are encouraged to be ready as soon as possible, and by 1 January 2022 at the latest. If the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> changes their rules and you <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> mark your goods based on new <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules which are different from the requirements in the UK, you will no longer be able to use the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> in the UK. This will be the case even if the change happens before 1 January 2022.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking">Find out how to use the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr></a>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> for both the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking will not be recognised on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Northern Ireland markets. Products currently requiring a <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> for sale in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will continue to need a <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> mark (and meet the other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules).</p>

<p>Although you are encouraged to prepare to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking for the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market as soon as possible, you do not need to change the conformity marking on your product if it is <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked and if either of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you self-declare the conformity of your good against the regulations</li>
  <li>you voluntarily use a testing or notified body to test against European or international standards</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to take additional action if your good needs third-party conformity assessment.</p>

<p>Check whether your UK approved body is taking steps that help you continue to export to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without needing to find an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body.</p>

<p>If not, you may need to apply for a new certificate from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body if you also want to sell your product in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Your approved body should provide another body of your choice with information relating to your conformity assessments in order to facilitate this.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Speak to your testing body or solicitor for advice on how conformity processes for your good will be affected.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> if you’re placing a qualifying Northern Ireland good on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market</h3>

<p>If you’re a Northern Ireland business, you’ll still be able to place qualifying Northern Ireland goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market with an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> conformity assessment marking (such as the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>) after 31 December 2021 if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you currently apply the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> to your good on the basis of self-declaration</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-recognised notified body (including a body in a country with which the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has a relevant mutual recognition agreement)</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by a UK-based body, and you are therefore using the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> with new UKNI marking</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll still be able to do this even if there are changes between the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules that the Northern Ireland Protocol applies to and <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> rules. This is part of the government’s commitment for Northern Ireland businesses to have unfettered access to the rest of the UK market.</p>

<h3>Using both the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h3>

<p>Both the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> mark can be placed on a product so long as neither impedes the visibility of the other and requirements of both the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation are met.</p>

<p>The essential requirements and standards that can be used to demonstrate conformity with them for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marked goods have not changed. That means that if your good is currently made to the technical requirements necessary for <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> then it will be made to the same technical requirements that exist for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking. However, the conformity assessment bodies that test them may need to be different.</p>

<h2>Appoint an authorised or responsible person in the UK</h2>

<p>Great Britain does not recognise authorised representatives and responsible persons based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you need to (or choose to) use an authorised representative or responsible person, they will need to be based in the UK for products being placed on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market.</p>

<h2>Check your legal responsibilities</h2>

<h3>Manufacturers</h3>

<p>You are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring your product complies with the relevant <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> rules</li>
  <li>drawing up documentation such as the declaration of conformity</li>
</ul>

<p>You can delegate some of the duties to an authorised representative – you will need to check the specific regulations that apply to confirm what can and cannot be delegated.</p>

<h3>UK distributors and suppliers</h3>

<p>You’ll need to confirm whether you or your supplier will act as an ‘importer’.</p>

<p>You’re an importer if you’re the first one bringing goods from outside the UK and placing them on the market in Great Britain. If someone has already placed a good on the UK market before you sell it in Great Britain - or if the manufacturer has appointed another UK-based person to carry out importer duties - you will remain a distributor and will not have any additional responsibilities.</p>

<p>As an importer, you’ll need to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods are labelled with your company’s details, including your company’s name and a contact address. Until 31 December 2022 you can provide these details on the accompanying documentation rather than on the good itself if you import certain goods from the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> (and in some cases Switzerland). After 31 December 2022, your details must be affixed to the product or, in circumstances where the legislation allows, on the packaging or an accompanying document</li>
  <li>the correct conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that goods have the correct conformity markings</li>
