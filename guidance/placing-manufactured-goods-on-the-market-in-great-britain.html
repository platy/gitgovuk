<p>This guidance is about placing manufactured goods on the market in Great Britain (GB). Great Britain is England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>There’s different guidance if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-eu-market">placing manufactured goods on the EU market</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-market-in-northern-ireland">placing manufactured goods on the market in Northern Ireland</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If you placed goods on the UK market (or in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> state) before 1 January 2021, you do not need to do anything for these individual goods.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>EEA states include any country in the EU, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</p>
</div>

<p>They can continue to circulate on either market until they reach their end user and do not need to comply with the changes that took effect from 1 January 2021. This guidance explains what you need to do for any goods you’re placing on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market after 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>A fully manufactured good is ‘placed on the market’ when a written or verbal agreement (or offer of an agreement) to transfer ownership or possession or other property rights in the product is exchanged.</p>

<p>‘Placing a good on the market’ means each individual good, not a type of good. It does not require the physical transfer of the good.</p>

<p>You can usually provide proof of placing on the market on the basis of any relevant document ordinarily used in business transactions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contracts of sale concerning goods which have already been manufactured and meet the legal requirements</li>
  <li>invoices</li>
  <li>documents concerning the shipping of goods for distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant economic operator (whether manufacturer, importer or distributor) bears the burden of proof for demonstrating that the good was placed on the market before 1 January 2021.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>All goods which previously required the CE marking will not need to use the UKCA marking until 1 January 2023</strong></p>

<p>Businesses are encouraged to be ready for full implementation of the new UK regime as soon as possible. However, to allow businesses time to adjust, CE marked goods in scope of this guidance that meet EU requirements (where these match UK requirements) can continue to be placed on the GB market until 31 December 2022 where EU and UK requirements remain the same. This includes goods which have been assessed by an EU recognised notified body.</p>

<p>The UKCA mark must be used for placing goods on the GB market from 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>You will still need to take action to ensure you comply with new importer responsibilities if you are placing a product on the GB market from the EU market.</p>
</div>

<h2>Check which rules apply</h2>

<p>What you need to do depends on the type of goods you’re placing on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market.</p>

<p>Most of this page covers goods subject to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukca-marking"><abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</a>.</p>

<p>There are different rules for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods regulated under the old approach</li>
  <li>goods covered by national rules (non-harmonised)</li>
  <li>certain other <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr>-marked goods, such as medical devices and civil explosives</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Check the sector specific legislation that applies to your goods. You can speak to your solicitor or trade association if you are unsure which regulatory framework applies to your goods.</p>
</div>

<h3>Old approach goods</h3>

<p>You must follow different rules if you’re placing the following goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/brexit/chemicals-brexit-guidance.htm" rel="external">chemicals</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://info.caa.co.uk/brexit/" rel="external">aerospace</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Goods covered by national rules (non-harmonised)</h3>

<p>You must make sure that your goods meet UK rules. You’ll need to do this even if they were previously sold in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-safety-for-businesses-a-to-z-of-industry-guidance">UK product safety rules</a> to find out what you need to do.</p>

<h3>Other goods</h3>

<p>There are also special rules if you’re placing the following goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Check if you need to change your conformity assessment or marking</h2>

<p>You need to use a conformity marking if you’re placing certain goods on the UK market. Before 1 January 2021 you could do this using the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> or other appropriate marking (such as the wheel marking or Pi marking).
The <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking is the conformity assessment marking for Great Britain for most goods previously subject to <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>.</p>

<p>Goods that are lawfully <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked will be accepted in the UK until 1 January 2023 for <a class="govuk-link" href="#legislation">certain goods</a>. You must be ready to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking from 1 January 2023 at the latest, although you should look to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The government will introduce legislation so that the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking can be placed on a label affixed to the product or on a document accompanying the product until 31 December 2025. This will apply for most goods requiring <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking. There will be different rules for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>medical devices</li>
  <li>construction products</li>
  <li>cableways</li>
  <li>unmanned aircraft systems</li>
  <li>marine equipment</li>
  <li>transportable pressure equipment</li>
  <li>rail products</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a Northern Ireland business, you can place qualifying Northern Ireland goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market with an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> conformity assessment marking, such as the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>.</p>

<p>The table below illustrates the accepted markings on each relevant market.</p>

<h3>Using the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h3>

<p>You only need to use the new <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking before 1 January 2023 if all of the following apply. Your product:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is covered by <a class="govuk-link" href="#legislation">legislation which requires the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</a>
</li>
  <li>requires mandatory third-party conformity assessment</li>
  <li>conformity assessment has been carried out by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-conformity-assessment">UK conformity assessment body</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This does not apply to existing stock. For example, if your good was fully manufactured, <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked and ready to place on the market before 1 January 2021. In these cases, the UK recognised conformity assessment body that assessed the goods was considered capable of conformity assessing to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements. These goods can still be sold in Great Britain with a&nbsp;<abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> but will need to be placed on the&nbsp;<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>&nbsp;market before 1 January 2023. After that time, you will need to use the&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr>&nbsp;marking.</p>

<p>These products are not allowed to be placed on the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> market. For goods where mandatory assessment has been done by a UK body, the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> must be followed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukni-marking">UKNI marking for goods being placed on the NI market</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Contact your solicitor or trade association for advice on whether your good will be affected.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukca-marking">Find out how to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</a>.</p>

<h4>Spares</h4>

<p>Products which are repaired, refurbished or exchanged without changing their original performance, purpose, or type, are not considered ‘new’ and therefore do not need to be recertified and remarked.</p>

<p>This includes if the product is temporarily exported for repair (as the product is not being placed on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market for the first time when re-imported).</p>

<p>If the product has been subject to important changes, substantially changing its original performance, purpose, or type, it will be considered as a ‘new’ product. Therefore, the modified product must comply with <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> regulatory requirements, including the requirement for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking from 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>Repair, replacement and maintenance operations are often carried out using other products which are spare parts. Spare parts are considered to have been placed on the market at the time at which the original product or system they are ultimately intended to repair, replace or maintain was placed on the market.</p>

<p>This means that spare parts can comply with the same conformity assessment requirements that were in place at the time the original product or system they are ultimately intended to repair, replace or maintain was placed on the market.</p>

<p>The definition of a spare part will vary depending on the commercial context but it’s broadly determined by a product’s ultimate intended usage. Whether a product is ultimately intended to be used as a spare part should be evidenced by any document demonstrating this intended use, which should be produced when requested by market surveillance authorities.</p>

<p>This guidance is intended to sit alongside existing provisions for spare parts in regulations and continues established practice in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Imported products</h4>

<p>Fully manufactured and conformity assessed <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr>-marked products which have been imported into <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> under contract before 31 December 2022 are considered as ‘placed on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market’ in relation to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukca-marking#more-information">products listed</a>. Therefore, these products do not need to undergo re-testing and re-certification to <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> requirements. However, the products should still be checked to ensure they meet the requirements of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law before they are further supplied.</p>

<p>A record should be kept of documentation which demonstrates the product was imported into <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> under contract before 1 January 2023. Market surveillance authorities may request this.</p>

<p>However, when products are imported into <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> for further manufacture or processing, they are not considered placed on the market. In this situation, the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> manufacturer of the finished product has the sole and ultimate responsibility for ensuring it is <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> compliant before placing it on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market from 1 January 2023.</p>

<h4>Mandatory third-party conformity assessment for the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h4>

<p>Where mandatory third-party conformity assessment was required for <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked goods, it is also required for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marked goods.</p>

<p>This conformity assessment needs to be carried out by a UK-recognised conformity assessment body in order to be marked with the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking. The type of conformity assessment procedures are the same that were required for the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-market-conformity-assessment-bodies">The UK Market Conformity Assessment Bodies (UKMCAB) database</a> lists all bodies which can provide conformity assessment for the UK market.</p>

<p>Where self-declaration of conformity is permitted for <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> this is also the case for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking.</p>

<h4>Reducing re-certification/re-testing costs for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h4>

<p>The government intends to introduce legislation which will allow completed conformity assessment activities carried out under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements (including existing testing, certification, and contractual arrangements relating to the quality control or auditing of existing certificates) undertaken by non-UK conformity assessment bodies (CABs) (accredited by their national accreditation body) for <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> certification before 1 January 2023 to be used by manufacturers to declare existing product types as compliant with <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr>. Products must still bear <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking and will need to undergo conformity assessment with a UK Approved Body at the expiry of the certificate or after 5 years (31 December 2027), whichever is sooner.</p>

<p>This will allow manufacturers to apply the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> mark without the need for any UK-recognised CAB involvement and continue to place their goods on the market, on the basis of their existing <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> type examination completed before 31 December 2022, for the lifetime of the certificate issued, or until 31 December 2027 (whichever is sooner).</p>

<p>Where manufacturers are using existing <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> certification completed before 1 January 2023 as the basis to demonstrate compliance with <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> for their products, we recommend that they include in the UK Declaration of Conformity the list of relevant UK designated standards and equivalent <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> harmonised standards that apply to their product, as well as details of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> CAB (or CAB recognised under an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Mutual Recognition Agreement) which carried out the conformity assessment procedures.</p>

<p>If conformity assessment procedures have not been completed and a supporting <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> certificate issued before 1 January 2023, these products are considered ‘new’ products. This also includes where goods are subject to important changes, overhauling its original performance, purpose, or type requiring new certification. Any ‘new’ good must comply with <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> regulatory requirements, including the requirement for conformity assessment by a UK approved body from 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>This measure applies across all module types for the following regulations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Noise Emission in the Environment by Equipment for Outdoor Use Regulations 2001</li>
  <li>Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008</li>

<h3>Using the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> for the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market</h4>

<p>You will be able to use the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> until 1 January 2023 if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you currently apply the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> to your good on the basis of self-declaration</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-recognised notified body (including a body in a country with which the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has a relevant mutual recognition agreement)</li>
  <li>the certificate of conformity previously held by a UK approved body was transferred to an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-recognised notified body before 1 January 2023</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only place <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked goods that meet <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements on the market in Great Britain while UK and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements are the same. This is currently the case and there are no UK plans to diverge at this time.</p>

<p>Nonetheless you are encouraged to be ready as soon as possible, and by 1 January 2023 at the latest. If the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> changes their rules and you <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> mark your goods based on new <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules which are different from the requirements in the UK, you will no longer be able to use the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> in the UK. This will be the case even if the change happens before 1 January 2023.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking">Find out how to use the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr></a>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> for both the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking will not be recognised on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Northern Ireland markets. Products currently requiring a <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> for sale in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will continue to need a <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> mark (and meet the other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules).</p>

<p>Although you are encouraged to prepare to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking for the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market as soon as possible, you do not need to change the conformity marking on your product if it is <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> marked and if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you self-declare the conformity of your good against the regulations</li>
  <li>you voluntarily use a testing or notified body to test against European or international standards</li>
  <li>the product will be placed on the market before 1 January 2023</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to take additional action if your good needs third-party conformity assessment.</p>

<p>Check whether your UK approved body is taking steps that help you continue to export to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without needing to find an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body.</p>

<p>If not, you may need to apply for a new certificate from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body if you also want to sell your product in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Your approved body should provide another body of your choice with information relating to your conformity assessments in order to facilitate this.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Speak to your testing body or solicitor for advice on how conformity processes for your good will be affected.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> if you’re placing a qualifying Northern Ireland good on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market</h3>

<p>If you’re a Northern Ireland business, you’ll still be able to place qualifying Northern Ireland goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market with an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> conformity assessment marking (such as the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>) from 1 January 2023 if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you currently apply the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> to your good on the basis of self-declaration</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-recognised notified body (including a body in a country with which the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has a relevant mutual recognition agreement)</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by a UK-based body, and you are therefore using the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> with new UKNI marking</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll still be able to do this even if there are changes between the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules that the Northern Ireland Protocol applies to and <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> rules. This is part of the government’s commitment for Northern Ireland businesses to have unfettered access to the rest of the UK market.</p>

<h3>Using both the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h3>

<p>Both the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> mark can be placed on a product so long as neither impedes the visibility of the other and requirements of both the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation are met.</p>

<p>The essential requirements and standards that can be used to demonstrate conformity with them for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marked goods have not changed. That means that if your good is currently made to the technical requirements necessary for <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> then it will be made to the same technical requirements that exist for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking. However, the conformity assessment bodies that test them may need to be different.</p>

<h2>Appoint an authorised or responsible person in the UK</h2>

<p>Great Britain does not recognise authorised representatives and responsible persons based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you need to (or choose to) use an authorised representative or responsible person, they will need to be based in the UK for products being placed on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market.</p>

<h2>Check your legal responsibilities</h2>

<p>Please check individual regulations applicable to your goods, as the definitions and requirements for economic operators and conformity assessment procedures may differ.</p>

<h3>Manufacturers</h3>

<p>You are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring your product complies with the relevant <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> rules</li>
  <li>drawing up documentation such as the declaration of conformity</li>
</ul>

<p>You can delegate some of the duties to an authorised representative – you will need to check the specific regulations that apply to confirm what can and cannot be delegated.</p>

<h3>UK distributors and suppliers</h3>

<p>You’ll need to confirm whether you or your supplier will act as an ‘importer’.</p>

<p>You’re an importer if you’re the first one bringing goods from outside the UK and placing them on the market in Great Britain. If someone has already placed a good on the UK market before you sell it in Great Britain  you will remain a distributor and will not have any additional responsibilities.</p>

<p>As an importer, you’ll need to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods are labelled with your company’s details, including your company’s name and a contact address. The government will introduce legislation so that the importer details can be provided via a sticky label or on an accompanying documentation rather than on the good itself if you import certain goods from the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> (and in some cases Switzerland). After 31 December 2025, your details must be affixed to the product or, in circumstances where the legislation allows, on the packaging or an accompanying document</li>
  <li>the correct conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and that goods have the correct conformity markings</li>
  <li>the manufacturer has drawn up the correct technical documentation and complied with their labelling requirements</li>
  <li>you maintain a copy of the declaration of conformity for a period of 10 years</li>
  <li>goods conform with the relevant essential requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>You must comply with the above for goods placed on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market regardless of whether they are <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marked.</p>

<h3>Placing goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market if you’re a business in Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>If you’re a Northern Ireland business selling goods on the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market that have been supplied to you (as a distributor) from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market, you’ll become an importer under <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> rules. You’ll need to make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods are labelled with your company’s details (or accompanying documentation depending on the requirements for that good) including with your company’s name and a contact address</li>
  <li>the correct conformity assessment procedures have been carried out and the goods have the correct conformity markings, which will be <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> conformity markings</li>
  <li>the manufacturer has drawn up the correct technical documentation</li>
  <li>goods conform with the relevant essential requirements, which could be <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements that the Protocol applies to Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>you take action if the good is unsafe by making it safe, withdrawing it from sale, or recalling it</li>
</ul>
