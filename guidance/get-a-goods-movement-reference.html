</ul>

<h4>Goods from Great Britain to the EU from 1 January 2022</h4>

<p>When you present a goods movement reference at an ‘arrived export’ location using the goods vehicle movement service, the goods movement reference should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference, for any goods being exported that are not also declared to the transit procedure</li>
  <li>the transit movement reference number, or the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference, for all goods exports that have been declared to the transit procedure</li>
  <li>the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference, for any goods declared to the transit procedure that are covered by an Excise Movement Control System guarantee</li>
</ul>

<p>When you present a goods movement reference at other locations as part of a pre-lodged export declaration using the goods vehicle movement service, the goods movement reference should include the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference.</p>

<p>For excise goods, declarations submitted using the Customs Declaration Service must not use the TRANS code. The declaration should be completed by presenting the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference when the goods leave the UK.</p>

<p>For excise goods leaving goods vehicle movement service locations, the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference must be entered into a goods movement reference.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>If you are a Customs Supervised Export (CSE) trader, you should email: exportpresentationapprovals@hmrc.gov.uk for instructions on how to obtain a goods movement reference.</p>
</div>

<h3>Getting a goods movement reference without needing to include declaration reference information</h3>

<p>There are circumstances when you can get a goods movement reference without needing to include any declaration references.</p>

<h4>When you declare goods orally or by conduct</h4>

<p>You can declare certain goods orally or by conduct at the border. ‘By conduct’ means that when you arrive at a point of exit or entry for Great Britain, you can make a ‘declaration by conduct’ by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>walking through a customs control point (this can be a green channel signed ‘nothing to declare’) with the goods, if you’re an individual on foot</li>
  <li>driving (or being driven) past a customs control point with the goods inside your vehicle, if you’re importing or exporting goods in a vehicle</li>
  <li>continuing your onward journey, if there are no customs control points</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to get a goods movement reference if you’re moving an empty trailer or any other commercial <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-goods-applicable-to-oral-and-by-conduct-declarations">goods that can be declared orally or by conduct</a> for either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>goods moved from the EU to Great Britain</li>
  <li>goods moved from Great Britain to the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>You can do this by selecting either the ‘oral or by conduct declarations’ or ‘empty’ option within the goods vehicle movement service.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may need to complete a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-to-make-an-entry-summary-declaration" class="govuk-link">safety and security declaration</a>, where you must indicate if your goods are moving under contract of carriage (the service will provide more information on how to do this).</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not every port will accept declaring goods orally or by conduct. You should check with your carrier before moving the goods.</p>
</div>

<h4>When you declare some postal items</h4>

<p>If you’re a designated postal operator or an Extra-Territorial Office of Exchange, you can get a goods movement reference without needing to include declaration reference information for some items.</p>

<p>This applies to goods moving under Universal Postal Union rules with CN37, CN38 and CN41 movement documents, and CN22 and CN23 item declaration forms.</p>

<h2>Get a goods movement reference</h2>

<p>You’ll need the Government Gateway user ID and password you used when you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-for-the-goods-vehicle-movement-service" class="govuk-link">registered for the goods vehicle movement service</a>.</p>

<p>Online services may be slow during busy times. Check if there are any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/get-a-goods-movement-reference-service-availability-and-issues">problems with this service</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>You need to present the goods movement reference at the port you’re leaving from. Contact the carrier at the port to find out how to do this.</p>

<p>The carrier will allow you to embark if the goods movement reference is valid.</p>

<p>You must follow instructions on whether you need to get your goods checked by customs on arrival or if you’re able to continue your journey.</p>

<h3>For imports from 1 January 2022</h3>

<p>You should use your goods movement reference number in the ‘<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/driver-inspection-notification/start">check if you need to report for an inspection</a>’ service to understand if your goods are held. If you’re arriving into the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel, you’ll need to attend an Inland Border Facility to have these checks carried out. For all other goods vehicle movement service locations, you must proceed to the inspection facility within or near the port if your goods are held.</p>

<p>In some cases you may also be stopped by Border Force officers within the port to have checks performed on your vehicle or load.</p>

<p>If this happens, you must still attend an inland border facility to complete customs functions if you have received instructions to do so.</p>

<p>The goods must be taken to an inland border facility directly and the goods must be in the same condition as they were at the time of importation.</p>

<p>You may be liable to a penalty of up to £2,500 if you fail to follow HMRC instructions.</p>

<h3>For exports from 1 January 2022</h3>

<p>Please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-locations-need-an-arrived-export-declaration-from-1-january-2022" class="govuk-link">Check which locations need an arrived export declaration from 1 January 2022</a>.</p>
