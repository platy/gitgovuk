<p>Claims for the third SEISS grant have now closed.</p>

<p>The last date for making a claim for the third grant was 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to claims made during the third grant period.</p>

<p>Details about the fourth grant will be announced on 3 March 2021.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who can claim</h2>

<p>Claims for the third grant have now closed. The last date for making a claim was 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>You must meet all the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme#whocanclaim" class="govuk-link">eligibility criteria</a> to claim the third grant.</p>

<h2>What you will need to make your claim</h2>

<p>You will need your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self Assessment Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)</li>
  <li>National Insurance number</li>
  <li>Government Gateway user ID and password</li>
  <li>UK bank details including account number, sort code, name on the account and address linked to the account</li>
</ul>

<p>Only provide bank account details where a Bacs payment can be accepted.</p>

<p>You may also need to answer questions about your passport, driving licence or information held on your credit file.</p>

<h3>If you do not have some of those things</h3>

<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-lost-utr-number" class="govuk-link">how to get your lost Unique Taxpayer Reference</a>.</p>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/lost-national-insurance-number">how to get your lost National Insurance number</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot remember your Government Gateway ID or password, you can attempt to recover them. You can do this when making your claim. You may need to answer questions about your passport, driving licence or information held on your credit file.</p>

<p>If you do not have a Government Gateway ID or password, you can create one when making your claim.</p>

<h2>How to claim</h2>

<p>Claims for the third grant have now closed. The last date for making a claim was 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>You must make the claim yourself. You must not ask a tax agent or adviser to claim on your behalf as this will trigger a fraud alert, which will delay your payment.</p>

<p>HMRC will check claims and take appropriate action to withhold or recover payments found to be dishonest or inaccurate. If you know you’ve been overpaid or are not eligible for the grant and do not tell us you may have to pay a penalty.</p>

<h2>Return to your claim</h2>

<p>If you need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/return-to-your-claim-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">return to your claim</a>, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the status of your payment</li>
  <li>update your bank details if we have asked you to</li>
  <li>check how much you got for previous grants</li>
  <li>check to see if you think the grant amount is too low</li>
</ul>

<h2>After you’ve claimed</h2>

<p>We will check your claim and pay your grant into your bank account within 6 working days. We will send an email when your payment is on its way.</p>

<p>Do not contact us unless it has been more than 10 working days since you made your claim and you have not received your payment in that time.</p>

<p>If your business recovers after you’ve claimed, your eligibility will not be affected as this is based on your reasonable belief that your trading profits would have been significantly reduced at the time you made your claim. You must keep evidence to support your claim.</p>

<p>If you made a claim in error as you were not eligible for a grant, have been overpaid or would like to make a voluntary repayment, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tell-hmrc-and-pay-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-back">tell HMRC and pay back some or all of the grant back</a>.</p>

<h2>Records you need to keep</h2>

<p>You must keep a copy of all records in line with normal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-records/how-long-to-keep-your-records" class="govuk-link">self-employment record keeping requirements</a>, including the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amount claimed</li>
  <li>grant claim reference</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re currently trading but have reduced demand</h3>

<p>You must keep any evidence that your business has had <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#impactedbyrd">reduced activity, capacity or demand</a> due to coronavirus at the time you made your claim, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>business accounts showing reduction in activity compared to previous years</li>
  <li>records of reduced or cancelled contracts or appointments</li>
  <li>fewer invoices</li>
  <li>a record of dates where you had reduced demand or capacity due to government restrictions</li>
</ul>

<h3>If your business is temporarily unable to trade</h3>

<p>You must keep evidence if your business has been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#tempunable">unable to trade</a> due to coronavirus, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a record of dates where you had to close due to government restrictions</li>
  <li>NHS Test and Trace communications - if you’ve been instructed to self-isolate in-line with NHS guidelines and are unable to work from home (if you’ve been abroad and have to self-isolate, this does not count)</li>
  <li>a letter or email from the NHS asking you to shield</li>
  <li>test results if you’ve been diagnosed with coronavirus</li>
  <li>letters or emails from your child’s school</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contacting HMRC</h3>

<p>We are receiving very high numbers of calls. Contacting HMRC unnecessarily puts our essential public services at risk during these challenging times.</p>

<p>But you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/get-help-with-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme">contact HMRC</a> if you cannot get the help you need online.</p>
