<p>You must make your claim for the fourth grant on or before 1 June 2021.</p>

<p>Before you claim, you must make sure you meet all the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme#whocanclaim" class="govuk-link">eligibility criteria</a>.</p>

<h2>What you’ll need to make your claim</h2>

<p>You’ll need your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self Assessment Unique Taxpayer Reference (<abbr title="Unique Taxpayer Reference">UTR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>National Insurance number</li>
  <li>Government Gateway user ID and password</li>
  <li>UK bank details including account number, sort code, name on the account and address linked to the account</li>
</ul>

<p>Only provide bank account details where a Bacs payment can be accepted.</p>

<p>You may also need to answer questions about your passport, driving licence or information held on your credit file.</p>

<h3>If you do not have some of those things</h3>

<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-lost-utr-number" class="govuk-link">how to get your Unique Taxpayer Reference</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/lost-national-insurance-number" class="govuk-link">National Insurance number</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot remember your Government Gateway ID or password, you can attempt to recover them. You can do this when making your claim. You may need to answer questions about your passport, driving licence or information held on your credit file.</p>

<p>If you do not have a Government Gateway ID or password, you can create one when making your claim.</p>

<h2>How to claim</h2>

<p>Claims for the fourth grant have now closed. The last date for making a claim was 1 June 2021.</p>

<p>You must make the claim yourself. You must not ask a tax agent or adviser to claim on your behalf as this will trigger a fraud alert, which will delay your payment.</p>

<p>HMRC will check claims. We’ll take appropriate action to withhold or recover payments for claims found to be dishonest or inaccurate. If you know you’re not eligible for the grant and do not tell us, you may also have to pay a penalty.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If an amendment to your tax return on or after the 3 March 2021 lowers the grant amount you’re eligible for, you’ll need to tell us within 90 days. You may need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tell-hmrc-and-pay-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-back">pay back some or all of the grant</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Return to your claim</h2>

<p>If you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/return-to-your-claim-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme">return to your claim</a>, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the status of your payment</li>
  <li>update your bank details if we have asked you to</li>
  <li>check how much you got for previous grants</li>
  <li>check to see if you think the grant amount is too low</li>
</ul>

<h2>After you’ve claimed</h2>

<p>We’ll check your claim and pay your grant into your bank account within 6 working days. We’ll send an email when your payment is on its way.</p>

<p>Do not contact us unless it has been more than 10 working days since you made your claim and you have not received your payment in that time.</p>

<p>If your business recovers after you’ve claimed, your eligibility will not be affected as this is based on your reasonable belief that your trading profits would have been significantly reduced at the time you made your claim. You must keep evidence to support this.</p>

<p>If you made a claim in error as you were not eligible for a grant or would like to make a voluntary repayment, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tell-hmrc-and-pay-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-back">tell HMRC and pay some or all of the grant back</a>.</p>

<h2>Records you need to keep</h2>

<p>You must keep a copy of all records in line with normal <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-records/how-long-to-keep-your-records">self-employment record keeping requirements</a>, including the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amount claimed</li>
  <li>grant claim reference</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re currently trading but have reduced demand</h3>

<p>You must keep any evidence that your business has had <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#impactedbyrd">reduced activity, capacity or demand</a> due to coronavirus at the time you made your claim, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>business accounts showing reduction in activity compared to previous years</li>
  <li>records of reduced or cancelled contracts or appointments</li>
  <li>a record of dates where you had reduced demand or capacity due to government restrictions</li>
</ul>

<h3>If your business is temporarily unable to trade</h3>

<p>You must keep evidence if your business has been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#tempunable">unable to trade</a> due to coronavirus, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a record of dates where you had to close due to government restrictions</li>
  <li>NHS Test and Trace communications - if you’ve been instructed to self-isolate in-line with NHS guidelines and are unable to work from home</li>
  <li>a letter or email from the NHS asking you to shield</li>
  <li>test results if you’ve been diagnosed with coronavirus</li>
  <li>letters or emails from your child’s school with information on closures or reduced hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contacting HMRC</h2>

<p>We are receiving very high numbers of calls. Contacting HMRC unnecessarily puts our essential public services at risk during these challenging times.</p>

<p>But you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/get-help-with-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme">contact HMRC</a> if you cannot get the help you need online.</p>
