<h2>Book and plan your visit to Drake Hall</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Drake Hall you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit at least 24 hours in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-drake-hall">required ID</a> with you when you go</li>

<h3>Entering Drake Hall</h3>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Drake Hall. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<p>The family-friendly visitors centre at Drake Hall is run by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonadvice.org.uk/hmp-yoi-askham-grange" rel="external">Prison Advice and Care Trust (PACT)</a>, a national charity. Visitors are offered a warm welcome, information and support.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days being run.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Drake Hall</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Drake Hall.</p>

<p>Women do not have phones in their rooms so they will always need to call you rather than you call them.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will generally have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this. Once purchased, phone credit is added weekly.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security on arrival so you will be able to speak to them during their first few days, once this list has been processed.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service.</a></p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Drake Hall using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Drake Hall.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>Include the person’s name and prison number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Drake Hall</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>

<p>Gifts are not permitted under any circumstances at Drake Hall. You can send prisoners money instead which they can use to buy items through a catalogue system.</p>

<h2>Life at Drake Hall</h2>

<p>Drake Hall is committed to providing a safe and educational environment where women can learn new skills to help them on release.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>

<p>When someone first arrives at Drake Hall, they will get to speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs. They will be taken to a single room in the unit and given bedding, towels and toiletries.</p>

<p>They will be able to contact a family member by phone. This could be quite late in the evening, depending on the time they arrive.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>

<p>Each person who arrives at Drake Hall gets an induction that lasts about a week. They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone also finds out about the rules, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<p>Around 340 women live at Drake Hall in a mixture of single and double rooms.</p>

<p>There is also an open unit outside the perimeter fence that gives up to 25 women the opportunity to work in the local community and prepare for release.</p>

<p>They have access to farms and gardens, indoor and outdoor gyms and other facilities in their free time.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>

<p>Women at Drake Hall can study or take workshops and training courses in a range of subjects.</p>

<p>They can take part in voluntary and paid work programmes, including a call centre, Halfords Academy, Greggs Academy, Max Spielmann Academy and McDonalds Hotel Group, with the possibility of employment on release.</p>

<p>Drake Hall has its own branch of the Women’s Institute.</p>

<p>Women at Drake Hall have access to agencies such as Women’s Aid and ANAWIM.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>

<p>Prisoners have the opportunity to leave the prison for short periods of time. This is known as release on temporary licence. It can be used to gain work experience in the local community, maintain family ties, ensure contact with their children and prepare for release.</p>
