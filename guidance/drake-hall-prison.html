<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Drake Hall. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<p>The family-friendly visitors centre at Drake Hall is run by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonadvice.org.uk/hmp-yoi-askham-grange" rel="external">Prison Advice and Care Trust (PACT)</a>, a national charity. Visitors are offered a warm welcome, information and support.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days being run.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Drake Hall</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Drake Hall.</p>

<p>Women do not have phones in their rooms so they will always need to call you rather than you call them.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will generally have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this. Once purchased, phone credit is added weekly.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security on arrival so you will be able to speak to them during their first few days, once this list has been processed.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service.</a></p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Drake Hall using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Drake Hall.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>Include the person’s name and prison number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Drake Hall</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>

<p>Gifts are not permitted under any circumstances at Drake Hall. You can send prisoners money instead which they can use to buy items through a catalogue system.</p>

<h2>Life at Drake Hall</h2>

<p>Drake Hall is committed to providing a safe and educational environment where women can learn new skills to help them on release.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>

<p>They will be able to contact a family member by phone. This could be quite late in the evening, depending on the time they arrive.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>

<p>Each person who arrives at Drake Hall gets an induction that lasts about a week. They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone also finds out about the rules, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<p>Around 340 women live at Drake Hall in a mixture of single and double rooms.</p>
