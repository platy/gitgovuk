<p>We are modernising our courts and tribunals system to make it more straightforward, accessible and efficient for all. It’s an ambitious £1bn programme designed to improve the system for both those who use it and for those working within it.</p>

<p>We host a number of engagement forums to ensure we’re collaborating with professional and public user groups on proposals and developments within the reform programme, to better understand their needs. 
This work will help shape the future landscape of the courts and tribunals services to achieve the best possible outcomes for all.</p>

<h2>Engagement during COVID-19</h2>

<p>During the coronavirus pandemic, we have increased our routine engagement activities with stakeholders. We are engaging actively and early on in processes as we introduce new arrangements in courts and tribunals in response to the crisis.</p>

<p>A number of temporary working groups were established to bring together different stakeholder groups’ representatives, providing input on jurisdictional or thematic issues. This list is an indicative, not exhaustive, summary of those currently operating.</p>

<h2>Criminal Justice Engagement Groups</h2>
<p>The reform programme is changing the way that criminal cases are dealt with in court. At the same time, other agencies in the criminal justice system – such as the police and prison and probation services – are also changing the ways that they work. Criminal Justice Engagement Groups bring together those agencies so we can coordinate our plans for improvement.</p>

<p>Our criminal justice groups are outlined below.</p>
