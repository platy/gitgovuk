<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Belgium to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>The Belgian authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://unitedkingdom.diplomatie.belgium.be/en/travel-to-belgium/working" rel="external">Belgium government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll need to check the specific rules of the region you’re going to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/en/working/british-workers-in-the-flemish-region#kjeybutm-2" rel="external">Flanders</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://emploi.wallonie.be/home/travailleurs-etrangers/permis-de-travail/dispenses.html" rel="external">Wallonia</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://economy-employment.brussels/permit-your-situation" rel="external">Brussels</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Belgium. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with the Belgian immigration authorities or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Belgium, so you know which ones to use when speaking to the Belgian authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Belgium for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs or seminar conventions</li>
  <li>board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>negotiating, signing and executing deals or contracts</li>
  <li>touring a company facility</li>
  <li>receiving goods supplied and manufactured by a Belgian company</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference (paid or unpaid)</li>
  <li>engaging in a commercial transaction by management/supervisory personnel and financial services personnel, including insurers, bankers and investment brokers</li>
  <li>tour guides or tour operators attending or participating in conventions or accompanying a tour</li>
  <li>providing translation and interpretation services</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
  <li>technical, scientific and statistical researchers carrying out research</li>
  <li>marketing research or analysis</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>Or for the following types of training, as long as it’s for the same company or group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving classroom-based training</li>
  <li>receiving on-the-job training</li>
  <li>shadowing someone’s job</li>
  <li>providing classroom-based or on-the-job training (Flanders only)</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer may need to submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.international.socialsecurity.be/working_in_belgium/en/limosa.html" rel="external">Limosa declaration</a> to the Belgian authorities.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Belgium’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt. 
All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>Each region in Belgium may also have its own exemptions and are not all covered in this guide. You’ll need to check with the individual authorities for a full list:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/en/working/british-workers-in-the-flemish-region#kjeybutm-2" rel="external">Flanders</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://emploi.wallonie.be/home/travailleurs-etrangers/permis-de-travail/dispenses.html" rel="external">Wallonia</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://economy-employment.brussels/permit-your-situation" rel="external">Brussels</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The following examples may be exempt in some regions but not in others so you would have to check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>after-sales service work (urgent maintenance or repair) for up to 5 calendar days in a month</li>
  <li>installing software for up to 8 calendar days a month</li>
  <li>prototype testing for up to 4 weeks in a calendar year (only in Brussels)</li>
  <li>installing or assembling first or initial systems or products for up to 8 days (doesn’t apply to those in the construction industry)</li>
  <li>self-employed workers staying in Belgium for business purposes for up to 5 days a month</li>
  <li>athletes, referees, support staff, official representatives, staff members, and any others recognised by the international or national sporting federations, travelling to Belgium for an international sports competition – allowed only for the duration of the competition and for a maximum of 3 months in a calendar year</li>
  <li>artists with an international reputation performing in Flanders for up to 21 days a quarter (includes support staff)</li>
  <li>artists with an international reputation performing in Brussels or Wallonia for up to 90 days a quarter (includes support staff)</li>
  <li>international transport sector workers (transporting passengers or goods)</li>
  <li>staff at international institutions – only if the institution’s status is governed by a ratified international treaty</li>
  <li>public administration staff and diplomats</li>
</ul>

<p>You also do not need a visa or permit if attending closed circle meetings for a maximum of 20 consecutive days at a time and 60 days a year. This includes customer negotiations, staff evaluations and company strategy meetings. Check with the Belgian authorities if you’re not sure whether your meeting is a ‘closed circle meeting’.</p>

<p>Your employer may need to submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.international.socialsecurity.be/working_in_belgium/en/limosa.html" rel="external">Limosa declaration</a> to the Belgian authorities.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>employment confirmation</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma and professional certificates</li>
  <li>CV</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re going for other business purposes or for more than 90 days, you may need a <a class="govuk-link" href="#permits">short or long-term permit</a>.</p>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Belgian embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit. The application process and document requirements vary by region so <a class="govuk-link" href="https://unitedkingdom.diplomatie.belgium.be/en/travel-to-belgium/working" rel="external">they will have to tell you which ones you need</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>For the short-term permits listed in this guide your family won’t be able to get dependant visas. They can join you for up to 90 days <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">under the visa waiver rules</a>.</p>

<p>There may be different rules for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://india.diplomatie.belgium.be/sites/default/files/content/download/consulair/Visa/visa_d-family_reunion_with_non-eu_spouse_art._1010bis.pdf" rel="external">taking families</a> if you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#long-term-transfer">long-stay permit</a>.</p>

<h3>Short and long-term permits</h3>
<p>You need to apply for a short-term work permit if you’re in Belgium for up to 90 days in a 180-day period because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring short term to a Belgian branch of a UK-based company</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing short-term services to a client in Belgium</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You need to apply for a long-term permit if you’re in Belgium for more than 90 days because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#long-term-transfer">transferring long term to the Belgian branch of a UK-based company</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a Belgian company on a long-term Belgian employment contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#long-term-services">providing long-term services to a client in Belgium</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#researcher">conducting research work</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Long-term permits are valid for up to 5 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<h2>Transferring short term to a Belgian branch of a UK-based company</h2>

<p>You need a short-term type B work permit for highly skilled workers if your UK-based employer is transferring you to a branch in Belgium.</p>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet minimum salary requirements</li>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract</li>
  <li>stay on UK payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>This type B permit can take 4 to 12 weeks to get. It’s valid for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://unitedkingdom.diplomatie.belgium.be/en/travel-to-belgium/working" rel="external">check the exact process and which forms you need</a> with the authority in the region as they vary. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<p>Your employer submits a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work permit application to the local immigration office</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.international.socialsecurity.be/working_in_belgium/en/limosa.html" rel="external">Limosa declaration</a> to the Belgian authorities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>Belgian authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Limosa declaration</li>
  <li>UK passport, valid for 6 months</li>
  <li>CV</li>
  <li>degree certificate from an accredited university</li>
  <li>signed employment contract with your UK employer</li>
  <li>signed assignment agreement with your UK employer</li>
  <li>social security cover certificate</li>
  <li>authorised employer’s ID</li>
  <li>comprehensive health insurance cover for Belgium</li>
</ul>

<h2>Providing short-term services to a client in Belgium</h2>

<p>You need a short-term work permit to provide support that requires specialised technical knowledge (such as installing, repairing and maintaining machinery) if your UK employer has a contract or work order with a Belgian company.</p>

<p>Some of these <a class="govuk-link" href="#exemptions">activities do not require a permit</a> if they’re only for a few days. Having this permit would allow you to carry out the work for a longer period of time.</p>
