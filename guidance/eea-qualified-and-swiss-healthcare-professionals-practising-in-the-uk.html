<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>To ensure that the process for recognising professional qualifications was not disrupted by the UK’s exit from the EU, the UK government enacted legislation. The legislation guarantees that qualifications previously automatically recognised with minimal barriers by UK regulators of healthcare professionals will be recognised under a near-automatic system.</p>

<p>This guidance explains the arrangements for <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-qualified and Swiss healthcare professionals (including any non-<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> spouses and dependants of the latter) practising in the UK.</p>

<p>Please note that this guidance only concerns the registration of professional qualifications. For further advice on obtaining the right to live and work in the UK, please see information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know">new immigration system</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/applying-for-settled-status">EU Settlement Scheme</a> the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/right-to-reside">right to reside</a>, and obtaining a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-health-care-visa/apply">Health and Care visa</a>.</p>

<p>The legislation places a duty on the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to carry out a statutory review of the provisions for near-automatic recognition, 2 years after 1 January 2021. This review will commence after 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>Your regulator will communicate information on any changes to processes resulting from this review. Any queries on such changes should be taken up with your regulator directly.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-qualified healthcare professionals</h2>

<p>The following advice applies to individuals who have an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-awarded or third country-awarded <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-recognised health or care qualification.</p>

<h3>Registration to practise in the UK</h3>

<p>If you have already completed the registration process, there is no further action you need to take. You will continue to be registered to practise.</p>

<p>If you are submitting a registration application after 11pm (<abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>) on 31 December 2020, if your health or care qualification is not listed among those identified as meeting the requirements for automatic recognition in EU law as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02005L0036-20200424#tocId127" rel="external">Annex V of Directive 2005/36/EC</a> (select the table of contents on the left-hand side and then select Annex V from the list), your application will be processed via the relevant regulator’s international registration process. For further details of those specific processes, please visit the webpage for the relevant regulatory body. A <a class="govuk-link" href="#UK-health-and-care-regulator-websites">list of links</a> to these can be found at the end of this document.</p>

<p>If your health or care qualification is listed among those identified as meeting the requirements for automatic recognition in EU law as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02005L0036-20200424#tocId127" rel="external">Annex V of Directive 2005/36/EC</a> (select the table of contents on the left-hand side and then select Annex V from the list), your application will be processed via a similar near-automatic recognition process as previously. Annex V contains lists of qualifications for the following professions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>doctor of medicine</li>
  <li>general nurse (adult nurse in the UK)</li>
  <li>midwife</li>
  <li>dentist, or specialist dentist</li>
  <li>pharmacist</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an individual’s eligibility for having their healthcare qualification recognised under this process by a UK regulator does not depend upon their nationality or country of residence</li>
  <li>the success of any application also depends on an applicant meeting the registration requirements relating to professional indemnity, character, English language and payment of fees stipulated by the UK regulator of their chosen healthcare profession</li>
</ul>

<p>For further advice on obtaining the right to live and work in the UK, please see information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know">new immigration system</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/applying-for-settled-status">EU Settlement Scheme</a> the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/right-to-reside">right to reside</a>, and obtaining a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-health-care-visa/apply">Health and Care visa</a>.</p>

<h3>Undertaking temporary and occasional work</h3>

<p>The UK no longer registers <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-qualified healthcare professionals for temporary and occasional (<abbr title="temporary and occasional">T&amp;O</abbr>) services. The UK no longer has access to the Internal Market Information (<abbr title="Internal Market Information">IMI</abbr>) system, so applications for the European Professional Card (<abbr title="European Professional Card">EPC</abbr>) can no longer be processed by UK regulators. There are no further automatic registrations for <abbr title="temporary and occasional">T&amp;O</abbr> with UK regulators via the <abbr title="European Professional Card">EPC</abbr> system either.</p>

<p>If you were already registered to undertake <abbr title="temporary and occasional">T&amp;O</abbr> work before 11pm (<abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>) on 31 December 2020, you can continue to provide <abbr title="temporary and occasional">T&amp;O</abbr> services until your temporary registration expires. You are no longer able to renew your temporary registration.</p>

<h2>Swiss healthcare professionals</h2>

<p>The following advice applies to individuals holding professional health and care qualifications who are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Swiss nationals</li>
  <li>non-<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> member state nationals who are the spouse or dependant of a Swiss national</li>
  <li>UK nationals settled in Switzerland</li>
  <li>non-<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> member state nationals who are the spouse or dependant of UK nationals settled in Switzerland</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registration to practise in the UK</h3>

<p>If you have already completed the registration process, there is no further action you need to take. You will continue to be registered to practise.</p>

<p>If you are submitting a registration application after 11pm (<abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>) on 31 December 2020, and if your health or care qualification is not listed amongst those identified as meeting the requirements for automatic recognition in EU law as per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02005L0036-20200424#tocId127" rel="external">Annex V of Directive 2005/36/EC</a> (select the table of contents on the left-hand side and then select Annex V from the list), you may still apply for registration via the relevant UK regulator under the directive through the general system of recognition or though acquired rights. For further details of those specific processes, please visit the webpage for the relevant regulatory body. A <a class="govuk-link" href="#UK-health-and-care-regulator-websites">list of links</a> to these can be found at the end of this document.</p>

<p>This is the case if one of the following applies to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your qualification was obtained in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland before 11pm (<abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>) on 31 December 2020</li>
  <li>you started but had not completed a Swiss or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> qualification before 11pm (<abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>) on 31 December 2020</li>
  <li>you hold a third country qualification that was recognised in Switzerland before 11pm (<abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>) on 31 December 2020</li>
  <li>you completed an application to have your qualification recognised in Switzerland before 11pm (<abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>) on 31 December 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>If one of the above does not apply to you, your application will be processed via the relevant regulator’s international registration process. For further details of those specific processes, please visit the webpage for the relevant regulatory body. A <a class="govuk-link" href="#UK-health-and-care-regulator-websites">list of links</a> to these can be found at the end of this document.</p>

Annex V lists certain qualifications for the following professions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>doctor of medicine</li>
  <li>general nurse (adult nurse in the UK)</li>
  <li>midwife</li>
  <li>dentist, or specialist dentist</li>
  <li>pharmacist</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the case if one of the following applies to you:</p>

  <li>your qualification was obtained in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland before 11pm (<abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>) on 31 December 2020</li>
  <li>you started but had not yet completed a Swiss or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> qualification before 11pm (<abbr title="Greenwich Mean Time">GMT</abbr>) on 31 December 2020</li>
</ul>
