<p>This information explains the interaction between land entered into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) standards agreement and other schemes, as well as other funding sources.</p>

<p>Existing schemes will continue to run alongside SFI, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), until it is delinked in 2024</li>
  <li>Countryside Stewardship (CS)</li>
  <li>Environmental Stewardship</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of 2024, new schemes will also be launched, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Nature Recovery</li>
  <li>Landscape Recovery</li>
</ul>

<h2>Including land in an SFI standards agreement and other schemes at the same time</h2>

<p>It’s possible to include the same land in an SFI standards agreement and another scheme if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you and your land are eligible for each scheme</li>
  <li>the activities or outcomes you’re being paid for under each scheme are compatible</li>
  <li>you are not being paid for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Payment Scheme</h2>

<p>You can include the same land parcel in a BPS application and your SFI standards agreement, as long as it’s eligible for each scheme.</p>

<p>If you apply for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lump-sum-payments-for-farmers-who-leave-or-retire-from-farming-and-delinked-payments/lump-sum-exit-scheme-and-delinked-payments-how-the-payments-will-work">Lump Sum Exit Scheme</a> in 2022, you should not apply for an SFI standards agreement. If you decide to withdraw your Lump Sum Exit Scheme application, you can then apply for an SFI standards agreement.</p>

<h2>Countryside Stewardship</h2>

<p>The interaction between an SFI standards agreement and CS is different depending on whether there’s a revenue option or capital items funding.</p>

<h3>CS revenue options</h3>

<p>If land used for a CS revenue option has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type for the standard you choose, you can enter it into an SFI standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the CS actions, including their timing, are compatible with the actions in the standard you choose</li>
  <li>you won’t be paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not the case, the ineligible CS revenue option land, including any land currently used for an ineligible rotational CS revenue option, cannot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be entered into an SFI standards agreement</li>
  <li>be used to complete any of the actions in the SFI standards</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you cannot enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an area of land used to establish a cover crop under CS into the arable and horticultural soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
  <li>an area of land used for a CS grass buffer strip on an improved grassland parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard you choose affects which CS revenue options are compatible and do not lead to double funding.</p>

<h4>CS revenue options and the moorland standard</h4>

<p>Land used for all CS revenue options can be entered into the introductory level of the moorland standard, if it has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type.</p>

<p>This is because the introductory level of the moorland standard does not involve physical land management actions, so there is no incompatibility or double funding.</p>

<h4>CS revenue options and the soils standards</h4>

<p>You can enter land used for certain CS revenue options into the introductory and intermediate levels in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils standard</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a> in 2022.</p>

<p>These eligible CS revenue options are set out in tables 1 and 2.</p>

<p>If you use an area of a land parcel for a CS revenue option not listed in tables 1 and 2 above, that area cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>However, you can enter the rest of the land parcel not covered by an ineligible CS revenue option into either of the soils standards (if it’s eligible land for the chosen standard).</p>

<p>For example, if part of a land parcel is used for a CS grass buffer strip, you can enter the rest of the area into either of the soils standards.</p>

<h3>Rotational CS revenue options</h3>

<p>A rotational CS revenue option is a multi-annual land management option that can be moved around identified land parcels in your CS agreement.</p>

<p>Each year of your CS agreement, you declare the area currently used for a rotational CS option. You do this either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the CS annual revenue claim, usually submitted by 15 May each year</li>
  <li>by 1 September in the relevant year if you cannot declare its location on the CS annual revenue claim</li>
</ul>

<p>Any area within a land parcel that’s currently used for an ineligible rotational CS revenue option cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>You can enter the rest of the land parcel not covered by an ineligible rotational CS revenue option into either of the soils standards (if it’s eligible land for the chosen standard).</p>

<p>The area currently used for an ineligible rotational CS revenue option will be automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your SFI application. This means the total area entered into your SFI standards agreement does not include the area currently used for an ineligible rotational CS revenue option.</p>

<p>Once your SFI standards agreement has started, the ineligible rotational CS revenue option area can be moved around the land parcels in your agreement. This is because we’ve already removed that area from your SFI application. However, this is only possible if the area of the ineligible rotational CS revenue option does not exceed the area automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your SFI application.</p>

<p>For example, a land parcel currently includes 2 hectares (ha) of SW6. That area is automatically removed from that land parcel in your SFI application. Once your SFI standards agreement has started, you can move that 2ha of SW6 around the land parcels in your agreement. However, if the area of SW6 increases to 2.5ha in either the second or third year of your SFI standards agreement, you’ll need to add land to your SFI standards agreement at the annual upgrade point to accommodate the additional 0.5ha.</p>

<h3>Applying for an SFI standards agreement if you have an existing CS agreement</h3>

<p>If you have an existing CS agreement, we will automatically remove the area of ineligible CS revenue options from the affected land parcels in your SFI application. This includes any area currently used for ineligible rotational CS revenue options.</p>

<p>This means the area is not included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your SFI application. For example, if there is a 10ha land parcel which has 2 ha of AB2 (Basic overwinter stubble), the ‘available area’ in your SFI application will be 8 ha.</p>

<h3>Applying for an SFI standards agreement and CS in 2022</h3>

<p>You may be applying for a CS Higher Tier or Mid Tier (including the Wildlife Offers) agreement starting from 1 January 2023. This may affect your SFI application if you include the same area of land in both CS and SFI.</p>

<p>If you submit your CS application and receive your CS agreement offer before you apply for SFI, any area of ineligible CS revenue options can be confirmed before you apply for SFI.</p>

<p>In this case, we will automatically remove the area of ineligible CS revenue options from the affected land parcels in your SFI application. This includes any area currently used for ineligible rotational CS revenue options.</p>

<p>This means the area isn’t included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your SFI application.</p>

<p>However, if the area of ineligible CS revenue options cannot be confirmed, it won’t be possible to automatically remove it from your SFI application. This will be the case if you apply for SFI before you submit your CS application.</p>

<p>This means the area of ineligible CS revenue options is included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ in your SFI application. You can only enter the total ‘available area’ into the standard you choose. It cannot be reduced in your SFI application to remove the area of ineligible CS revenue options.</p>

<p>If you enter the same area of land into both an SFI soils standard and an ineligible CS revenue option in a CS agreement that starts from 1 January 2023, your SFI payment will be automatically adjusted.</p>

<p>For example, you enter a 10 ha land parcel into one of the soils standards and include that same land parcel in your CS application. You have only included 1 ha of this land parcel in your CS application, but it’s in an ineligible CS revenue option for the SFI soils standard you have chosen. If your CS agreement starts after your SFI standards agreement, you will only be eligible for an SFI payment on 9 ha of that land parcel.</p>

<h3>CS capital items funding</h3>

<p>If you apply for a CS Capital Grants agreement, the same land parcel can be entered into an SFI standards agreement.</p>

<h2>Environmental Stewardship</h2>

<p>If land used for an Environmental Stewardship (ES) revenue option has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type for the standard you choose, you can enter it into an SFI standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ES actions, including their timing, are compatible with the actions in the standard you choose</li>
  <li>you won’t be paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not the case, the ineligible ES revenue option land, including any land currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option, cannot be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>entered into an SFI standards agreement</li>
  <li>used to complete any of the actions in the SFI standards</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you cannot enter an area of land:</p>

<ul>
  <li>used to establish a cover crop under ES into the arable and horticultural soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
  <li>used for an ES grass buffer strip on an improved grassland parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard you choose affects which ES revenue options are compatible and do not lead to double funding.</p>

<h3>ES revenue options and the moorland standard</h3>

<p>Land used for ES revenue options can be entered into the introductory level of the moorland standard if it has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type.</p>

<p>This is because the introductory level of the moorland standard does not involve physical land management actions, so there is no incompatibility or double funding.</p>

<h3>ES revenue options and the soils standards</h3>

<p>You can enter land used for certain ES revenue options into the introductory and intermediate levels in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils standard</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a> in 2022.</p>

<p>These eligible ES revenue options are set out in tables 3 and 4.</p>

<h3>Rotational ES revenue options</h3>

<p>A rotational ES revenue option is a multi-annual land management option that can be moved around identified land parcels in your ES agreement.</p>

<p>Each year of your ES agreement, you declare the area currently used for a rotational ES option. You do this either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the ES annual revenue claim, usually submitted by 15 May each year</li>
  <li>by 1 September in the relevant year if you cannot declare its location on the ES annual revenue claim</li>
</ul>

<p>Any area within a land parcel that’s currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>The area currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option will not be automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your SFI application. This is because that ES agreement information is held on a separate system. Instead, we will manually remove that area after you’ve submitted your SFI application.</p>

<p>Once your SFI standards agreement has started, the ineligible rotational ES revenue option area can be moved around the land parcels in your agreement. This is because we’ve already removed that area from your SFI application. However, this is only possible if the area of the ineligible rotational ES revenue option does not exceed the area we’ve removed from the ‘available area’ in your SFI application.</p>

<h3>Applying for an SFI standards agreement if you have an existing ES agreement</h3>

<p>If you have an existing ES agreement, we will automatically remove the area of ineligible non-rotational ES revenue options from the affected land parcels in your&nbsp;SFI&nbsp;application. However, we cannot automatically remove the area currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option, because that ES agreement information is held on a separate system.</p>

<p>If you’re applying for SFI on land that’s currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option , you’ll need to submit your SFI application including that area. We will then manually reduce the ‘available area’ to remove the area currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option. We will contact you to confirm the revised ‘available area’ in the affected land parcel before we offer you an SFI standards agreement.</p>

<h2>Sustainable Farming Incentive pilot</h2>

<p>Land parcels already in a Sustainable Farming Incentive pilot standards agreement cannot be entered into your SFI standards agreement.</p>

<h2>Local Nature Recovery</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-nature-recovery-more-information-on-how-the-scheme-will-work/local-nature-recovery-more-information-on-how-the-scheme-will-work">Local Nature Recovery</a> (LNR) is expected to launch by the end of 2024. You’ll be able to apply for LNR options on land entered into an SFI standards agreement, as long as the eligibility and compatibility requirements are met and there’s no double funding.</p>

<p>The LNR options will initially cover the following themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>managing feeding, shelter and breeding areas for wildlife on arable farms</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating grassland habitats such as species-rich grassland on farms and in the wider countryside</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating wetland habitats such as ponds, lakes, reedbeds and fens</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating lowland heathland</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating coastal habitats such as sand dunes, salt marsh and shingle</li>
  <li>managing and restoring areas of upland and lowland peat and moorland on farms and in the wider countryside</li>
  <li>targeted measures to support the recovery and reintroduction of particular wildlife species, such as creating and managing nesting and feeding habitat, and to tackle non-native invasive species</li>
  <li>managing and creating trees and woodlands, including agroforestry, traditional orchards and tree planting on areas of farms (the England Woodland Creation Offer will be the main scheme for creating woodland until 2025)</li>
  <li>nature-based solutions for water, such as creating and managing in-field vegetation, buffer strips and swales to reduce and filter runoff and contribute to natural flood management</li>
  <li>restoring rivers, flood plains, streams and riparian habitats</li>
</ul>

<p>More LNR guidance will be published on GOV.UK over the next year.</p>

<h2>Landscape Recovery</h2>

<p>You can apply for Landscape Recovery on land entered into an SFI standards agreement, as long as the eligibility and compatibility requirements are met and there’s no double funding.</p>

<h2>Farming in Protected Landscapes</h2>

<p>If you have land in a National Park Authority or Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) you can apply for Farming in Protected Landscapes funding and enter that same land into an SFI standards agreement, as long as the eligibility and compatibility requirements are met and there’s no double funding.</p>

<h2>Private sector schemes</h2>

<p>In 2022, you can enter the same area of land into an SFI standards agreement and a private sector scheme arrangement, such as carbon trading or payments for natural flood management.</p>

<p>The approach to private sector schemes will be reviewed by Defra annually.</p>
