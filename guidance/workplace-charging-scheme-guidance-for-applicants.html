<h2>About the scheme</h2>

<p>The Workplace Charging Scheme (<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>) is a voucher-based scheme that provides eligible applicants with support towards the upfront costs of the purchase and installation of electric vehicle (<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>) chargepoints.</p>

<p>It is available in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not in the Channel Islands or Isle of Man.</p>

<p>The scheme is run by the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>) and administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>).</p>

<p>This guidance is aimed at applicants. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-installers">Guidance for installers and manufacturers</a> is also available.</p>

<h3>How the scheme works</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> is open to businesses, charities and public sector organisations that meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#applicant-eligibility">applicant</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#site-eligibility">site eligibility</a> criteria.</p>

<p>The grant covers up to 75% of the total costs of the purchase and installation of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints (inclusive of VAT), capped at a maximum of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£350 per socket</li>
  <li>40 sockets across all sites per applicant – for instance, if you would like to install them in 40 sites, you will have 1 socket available per site</li>
</ul>

<p>After applying using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-application-form">online application form</a>, successful applicants are issued with a unique identification voucher code by email, which can then be given to any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-chargepoints-authorised-installers"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-authorised commercial chargepoint installer</a>.</p>

<p>Once the chargepoint(s) have been installed, the authorised installer can claim the grant from <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> on the applicant’s behalf. The chargepoint installation must be completed and the voucher claimed within 6 months of the voucher’s issue date. Claims against expired vouchers will not be paid.</p>

<p>Installers must not charge applicants for the grant in advance of payment being made by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>. After <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reimburses your installer for the value of your voucher, this cost will be discounted from your final invoice.</p>

<p>If you apply for less than 40 sockets, you can submit additional applications in the future until you reach that limit. <a class="govuk-link" href="#linked-enterprise">Special rules apply for linked enterprises.</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to terminate or change the rules of this grant scheme – including the grant level – at any time, although we will endeavour to provide up to 4 weeks’ notice. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will honour any voucher codes that have been issued ahead of any changes to the grant or during any notice period given following the announcement of the scheme’s closure.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<h4>Applicant</h4>

<p>A party who has declared an existing or future need for charging infrastructure. For the purposes of this scheme, an applicant can be any eligible business, charity or public sector organisation.</p>

<p>Applicants must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#t-and-cs">terms and conditions</a> of the scheme and have permission to install charging infrastructure at designated off-street parking facilities dedicated to staff and/or fleet use.</p>

<h4>Authorised installer</h4>

<p>A party that has been authorised to install <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> through the process outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-installers">guidance for installers</a>. Installers manage the installation of chargepoints at applicant’s sites.</p>

<p>The term ‘installer’ in this guidance means ‘authorised installer’.</p>

<h4>Authorised installer representative</h4>

<p>A party that has been authorised to sub-contract to installers the installation of chargepoints under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>The authorised installer representative remains wholly responsible for ensuring that the installers abide by the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="#t-and-cs">terms and conditions</a> of the scheme. If an authorised installer representative’s installer fails to meet the terms and conditions, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> may revoke the authorisation of the authorised installer representative.</p>

<h4>Authorised chargepoint manufacturer</h4>

<p>A party that manufactures chargepoints that have been authorised under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> through the process outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-installers">guidance for manufacturers</a>.</p>

<h4>Staff and/or fleet parking</h4>

<p>Off-street parking that is designated to the applicant and is for their staff or fleet, and not for customer use. Applicants must be able to provide evidence of this on request (for example, details of a parking policy or photographic evidence).</p>

<p>If the primary use of the chargepoints remains staff/fleet use, you may allow local residents to use the chargepoints outside of office hours when they will not typically be used by your staff or fleet vehicles.</p>

<p>The parking facilities must be clearly associated with the applicant’s premises and be either on-site or a reasonable distance from the place of work.</p>

<h4>Customer parking</h4>

<p>Parking that is available to be used by the applicant’s customers. Customer parking is not eligible for the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Chargepoint socket (also referred to as ‘chargepoints’ or ‘chargepoint units’)</h4>

<p>Sockets that are used to charge an <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>. There are 4 modes of <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint socket, and mode 3 and 4 are eligible for <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>. Each socket must have at least a 3kW supply undiminished by simultaneous charging.</p>

<p>Modes 1 and 2 (such as a normal 3-pin socket) are not eligible. For more information, refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/commercial-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">minimum technical specification for commercial chargepoints</a>.</p>

<h2>Grant eligibility</h2>

</li>
      <li>have received – or have currently pending at the time of application – less than €200,000 of public support in the last 3 financial years (meaning the previous 2 financial years plus the current financial year) and satisfy the <a class="govuk-link" href="#de-minimis-aid">state aid requirements for de minimis aid</a>
</li>
      <li>have received – or have currently pending at the time of application – less than 325,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) limit of public support in the last 3 financial years (meaning the previous 2 financial years plus the current financial year) and satisfy the <a class="govuk-link" href="#small-amounts-of-financial-assistance">Special Drawing Rights requirements</a>. Use this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coinmill.com/SDR_calculator.html" rel="external">SDR currency exchange rate conversion calculator</a> to calculate the equivalent in GBP.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>declare a need for <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging equipment, or an intent to encourage uptake among their staff and/or fleet (you do not need to possess a plug-in <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>)</li>
  <li>be located in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (applicants in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man are not eligible)</li>
  <li>have dedicated off-street parking for staff and/or fleet use only</li>
  <li>have parking facilities that are clearly associated with the applicant premises and be either on-site or at a reasonable distance from the workplace</li>
  <li>own the property or have consent from the landlord for chargepoints to be installed at all the sites listed in the application</li>
</ul>

<h4>Applicants who are part of a linked enterprise or single economic actor</h4>

<p>A linked enterprise is one where a group of enterprises, such as businesses or companies, are sufficiently linked such that, for state aid purposes, they should be treated as a single undertaking under de minimis aid rules.</p>

<p>‘Economic actor’ means an entity or a group of entities constituting single economic entity, regardless of its legal status, that is engaged in an economic activity by offering goods or services on a market. A company with subsidiaries or branches would be regarded as a single economic actor, unless the subsidiaries are effectively autonomous of the group and cannot rely on it for resources or financing. This definition is valid for subsidies awarded in accordance with article 364 of the UK-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Trade and Cooperation Agreement.</p>

<p>Franchises should consider whether they meet the above criteria defining a single economic actor or the below criteria defining a linked enterprise. This will depend on the terms of your franchise agreement.</p>

<p>A group of linked enterprises will be treated as a ‘single undertaking’ when either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one enterprise has a majority of the shareholders’ or members’ voting rights in another enterprise</li>
  <li>one enterprise has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of another enterprise</li>
  <li>one enterprise has the right to exercise a dominant influence over another enterprise, pursuant to a contract entered into with that enterprise or to a provision in its memorandum or articles of association</li>
  <li>one enterprise, which is a shareholder in or member of another enterprise, controls alone – pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders in or members of that enterprise – a majority of shareholders’ or members’ voting rights in that enterprise</li>
</ul>

<p>Enterprises that have any of these relationships through one or more other enterprises will also be considered to be a single undertaking.</p>

<p>More information about linked enterprises can be found in article 3.3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/conferences/state-aid/sme/smedefinitionguide_en.pdf" rel="external">European Commission’s User guide to the <abbr title="small and medium-sized enterprise">SME</abbr> definition</a>.</p>

<p>For applicants that are part of a single undertaking or constitute a single economic actor, the maximum limit of 40 sockets applies to the entire single undertaking or the entire single economic actor. Applicants will need to declare that, by receiving the grant, they (or the single undertaking or single economic actor of which they are part) do not exceed the <a class="govuk-link" href="#de-minimis-aid">de minimis state aid</a> limit of €200,000 or the <a class="govuk-link" href="#small-amounts-of-financial-assistance">Special Drawing Rights limit of 325,000</a> in the past 3 fiscal years.</p>

<p>If you previously applied for the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> as part of a franchise, you can apply for funding for subsequent chargepoint sockets provided you do not exceed the 40-socket limit. If you are now part of a linked enterprise or constitute a single economic actor, this limit will apply to the entire linked enterprise or single economic actor (all parts of it) and the number of sockets available to you will depend on the number of grants previously allocated to all the organisations that are part of that linked enterprise or single economic actor.</p>

<p>Where considered necessary, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to request further information or documentary evidence from relevant parties in support of any individual claim.</p>

<h4>Evidence required</h4>

<p>If your organisation is a registered business, charity or public sector organisation, this should be primarily evidenced by a Companies House reference number.</p>

<p>If you do not have this, you may use a VAT registration number.</p>

<p>If you have neither of these, you may use an <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> letter showing the business name, address and unique tax reference (UTR) number.</p>

<p>Charities not in possession of any of this documentation can upload a copy of their registration to the Charity Commission or a letter from a principal regulator by using the upload field reserved for the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> registration letter.</p>

<p>Schools and colleges in England and Wales registered at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk" rel="external">Get Information about Schools</a> can upload a pdf document of ‘establishment details’ showing the establishment’s ID number.</p>

<p>Schools in Northern Ireland registered at <a class="govuk-link" href="http://apps.education-ni.gov.uk/appinstitutes/default.aspx" rel="external">Department of Education Institution Search</a> can upload a pdf document of ‘institution details’ showing the institution’s reference number.</p>

<p>Schools in Scotland listed at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://education.gov.scot/parentzone/" rel="external">Parent Zone</a> can upload a pdf document of ‘school details’ showing the school’s SEED number. This can be done by using the upload field reserved for the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> registration letter. The person applying for the grant on behalf of a school or college needs to make sure their email address domain matches the email domain of the school or college concerned.</p>

<p>NHS surgeries not in the possession of a companies house number, a VAT or <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> letter and registered at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/Organisation/Search" rel="external">NHS Digital ODS Portal</a> (in England and Wales), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/scotlands-service-directory/gp-practices" rel="external">NHS inform</a> (in Scotland) or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/services/gp-practices" rel="external">Find a GP practice</a> (in Northern Ireland) can upload a pdf document showing the name and address of the surgery by using the upload field reserved for the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> letter. The person applying for the grant must apply for the grant using the NHS email domain such as @nhs.net, @nhs.scot or @hscni.net. The address of the installation site must be the same as the address registered with NHS.</p>

<p>If you are unable to provide any of these documents, we will be unable to issue you with a voucher.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about the eligibility of your organisation, contact the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk">workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>De minimis aid</h3>

<p>Funding granted to organisations through the&nbsp;<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>&nbsp;may constitute state aid, which is generally prohibited under European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) law. However, small amounts of aid have been deemed compatible with&nbsp;<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>&nbsp;law under the de minimis rules set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/de_minimis_regulation_en.pdf" rel="external">Commission Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No. 1407/2013</a>.</p>

<p>This allows aid up to €200,000 over a 3-year fiscal period to be given to a single undertaking.</p>

<p>The €200,000 de minimis state aid limit applies to companies in Northern Ireland that trade in goods or wholesale electricity markets with the European Union. It also applies to businesses providing services that are specifically tailored to the needs of a particular company or sector that manufacturers or trades in goods or wholesale electricity markets between Northern Ireland and the European Union.</p>

<h3>Small Amounts of Financial Assistance, Article 364 of the UK-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Trade and Cooperation Agreement</h3>

<p>Funding granted to organisations through the&nbsp;<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>&nbsp;may constitute state aid through small amounts of financial assistance that have been deemed compatible with Article 364 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukeu-and-eaec-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-ts-no82021#full-publication-update-history">UK/<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and EAEC: Trade and Cooperation Agreement [TS No.8/2021]</a> under the Special Drawing Rights without engaging Chapter 3 of Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Special drawing rights (SDR) are supplementary international reserve assets defined and maintained by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>

<p>This allows aid up to 325,000 Special Drawing Rights over a 3-year fiscal period to be given to a single economic actor. The 325,000 limit can be converted to GBP by using this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coinmill.com/SDR_calculator.html" rel="external">SDR currency exchange rate conversion calculator</a>.</p>

<p>Applicant public authorities (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#public-authority-definition">how we define ‘public authority’</a>) are not required to make a de minimis declaration or Special Drawing Rights declaration during the&nbsp;<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>&nbsp;application process.</p>

<p>All other organisations must make a de minimis or Special Drawing Rights declaration during the&nbsp;<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>&nbsp;application process provided that they:</p>

  <li>are not <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#public-authority-definition">defined as a public authority</a>
</li>
  <li>have received – or have currently pending at the time of application – less than €200,000 of de minimis aid or 325,000 Special Drawing Rights aid in the last 3 financial years (meaning the previous 2 financial years plus the current financial year)</li>
</ul>

<p>In this de minimis declaration or Special Drawing Rights declaration, the applicant must declare any support they have received from public sources that was given under de minimis aid or Special Drawing Rights aid</p>

<p>Organisations that are not a public authority and have received more than €200,000 de minimis aid or 325,000 Special Drawing Rights aid in the past 3 fiscal years are not eligible for the&nbsp;<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Site eligibility</h3>

<p>Applicants must have designated off-street parking facilities with spaces dedicated for staff and/or fleet use that are suitable for chargepoint installations. All parking must be designated to the applicant, although the rest of the car park may be shared with other organisations.</p>

<p>Each site must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a minimum power supply of 3kW to each individual socket that is not diminished by their simultaneous use</li>
  <li>have no more than one socket installed for each accessible parking space</li>
  <li>be for staff and/or fleet use</li>
</ul>

<h4>Working from home</h4>

<p>If your primary place of work is also a residential property (your home), you can apply for the grant under this scheme as long as your address is listed as your place of business with Companies House or <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Sites that are not eligible for this scheme</h4>

<p>The following sites are not eligible for the scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>locations outside England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (including the Channel Islands and Isle of Man)</li>
  <li>parking facilities that are part of a domestic property (and it is not your primary place of work) – you may be able to apply to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-grants-for-low-emission-vehicles#ev-chargepoint-grant"><abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant</a> instead if you want to install an <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint in a residential dwelling</li>
  <li>where the site of installation is an address that has claimed previously under the scheme – or its predecessor, the Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme (<abbr title="Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>) – or Domestic Recharging Scheme (<abbr title="Domestic Recharging Scheme">DRS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>parking facilities that are solely for customer use</li>
  <li>parking facilities not designated to the applicant</li>
  <li>parking facilities that have not yet been built – only existing designated off-street parking is eligible for the scheme; a confirmation letter (from, for example, your local council) does not oblige the applicant to proceed with the construction and <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, therefore, cannot rely on it as evidence</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will not grant exceptions for locations that do not meet these eligibility criteria.</p>

<h4>Dealerships</h4>

<p>Chargepoints installed in order to charge demonstrator vehicles, showroom vehicles, courtesy cars and vehicles in for servicing and repair are eligible under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Before applying</h4>

<p>Before applying, applicants are encouraged to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/business/transport/advice-on-large-fleet/" rel="external">Energy Saving Trust’s advice on large fleets</a>
</li>
  <li>discuss their needs with one or more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-chargepoints-authorised-installers">authorised <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> installers</a> as the chargepoint requirements may differ depending on the business need and installers are only authorised to install models on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-approved-chargepoint-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved commercial chargepoint model list</a>
</li>
  <li>undergo a site survey with an authorised installer to ensure the electrical capacity of the site can support the number of sockets for which you are applying</li>
  <li>consider the needs of disabled drivers and drivers with reduced mobility</li>
  <li>consider how the chargepoint will be maintained and any associated costs</li>
  <li>consider how the cost of electricity usage will be covered and if/how you would charge users for it</li>
</ul>

<p>If the applicant does not own or manage the land where they wish to install chargepoints, they must also secure the necessary permissions ahead of making an application. For example, if you have access to off-street parking via a garage or private car park that is provided by a third party, you are eligible for the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> provided the parking space meets all other eligibility criteria. If you do not own the parking space, however, you will be required to gain written permission from the landlord or owner.</p>

<h4>Evidence required</h4>

<p>Applicants must be able to provide evidence on request that the site of installation is linked to the business and that the parking is dedicated wholly to staff and/or fleet use – for example, parking policy or photographic evidence.</p>

<p>If a postcode is found to have been used by another company, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> may seek evidence that the proposed site is used by more than one commercial entity – for example, a letter from the site owner or landlord.</p>

<h3>Installer and chargepoint requirements</h3>

<p>Applicants can only redeem their <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> voucher with authorised installers and against approved chargepoint models. The chosen authorised installer will then claim the grant on their behalf.</p>

<p>The grant can be used towards the cost of purchasing and installing a chargepoint. The chargepoints must be brand new and not yet installed.</p>

<p>You may provide your own chargepoint if it is on the approved chargepoint model list and you have a manufacturer’s 3-year on-site warranty. However, such equipment will not be eligible for a grant under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>. In this instance, only the cost of labour and other parts provided for the installation will be eligible for the grant.</p>

<p>You cannot claim against:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a previously installed or second-hand chargepoint – the chargepoint unit must be new</li>
  <li>installations made prior to a voucher being issued – applicants must apply for a voucher before installing any chargepoints</li>
</ul>

<p>Before applying, we strongly advise applicants to check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your chosen installer is authorised by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> under this scheme – <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-authorised-installers">view the list of&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved installers under the&nbsp;<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr></a>)</li>
  <li>your chosen chargepoint(s) is on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-approved-chargepoint-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved commercial chargepoint model list</a> at the time of installation</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that chargepoints are listed at the request of their manufacturers. If your chargepoint is not present, contact the chargepoint manufacturer to confirm why it is not listed.</p>

<h3>Terms and conditions</h3>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to take whatever action it deems appropriate if there is any evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>scheme requirements not being upheld</li>
  <li>fraudulent activity</li>
  <li>misuse of government funding by any party</li>
</ul>

<p>Before applying to the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>, you must ensure you meet the following terms and conditions:</p>

  <li>I acknowledge any voucher received is not transferable and can only be redeemed by the organisation stated in this application using a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-chargepoints-authorised-installers">commercial chargepoint installer authorised by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr></a>. I acknowledge that the voucher can only be applied at the addresses listed in my application.</li>
  <li>I am aware that, by applying for a voucher, I am applying for a grant that is operating under&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="#de-minimis-aid">de minimis state aid regulations</a> or Special Drawing Rights&nbsp;and I have confirmed that I have not exceeded the €200,000 limit or 325,000 Special Drawing Rights limit permitted within a 3-year rolling period. I confirm that, by receiving the&nbsp;<abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>&nbsp;grant, I do not exceed the state aid limit of €200,000 or Special Drawing Rights limit of 325,000 in the past 3 fiscal years. The 325,000 limit can be converted to GBP by using this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coinmill.com/SDR_calculator.html" rel="external">SDR currency exchange rate conversion calculator</a>.</li>
  <li>I acknowledge that any voucher received will only be eligible at the sites listed in this application up to the total number of chargepoints stated. If, following the site survey, I would like to install more chargepoints, I will apply for subsequent vouchers, provided my cumulative total does not exceed 40 sockets.</li>
  <li>I am content for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-chargepoints-authorised-installers">authorised chargepoint installer</a> to claim the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> grant on my behalf and acknowledge that I may be contacted in the future by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> or its agents for audit purposes, which may include site visits.</li>
  <li>I understand that the installation of electric vehicle chargepoints must be completed before the expiry date stated on the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> voucher (180 days from when it is issued) and will allow installers sufficient time to complete the installations. If the installation is not complete within the expiry date on the voucher, I will need to reapply for the scheme.</li>
  <li>I understand that the voucher is awarded on the condition that usage data is supplied to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> for a minimum of 3 years following installation. I give permission for them to use this usage data (in an anonymised form) to inform future policy development.</li>
  <li>I understand that, as the grant recipient, the applicant must ensure that the chargepoints installed are maintained in a serviceable condition and are available for use for at least 3 years, from the point of first installation, unless given specific permission otherwise by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</li>
  <li>I understand that, if the chargepoint needs to be removed or taken out of commission within 3 years from the date of installation, I must inform <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:worplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk">worplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk</a>. This may result in the grant being reclaimed.</li>
  <li>I understand that I am responsible for paying the costs associated with electricity usage for the chargepoint, as well as any back-office and maintenance costs associated with the chargepoint. I also understand that I can charge my employees for the electricity usage associated with the chargepoint. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> is not responsible for these costs.</li>
  <li>I understand that my personal information will be safeguarded and processed in accordance with data protection legislation. The Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) is the Data Controller for <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> for the purposes of data protection law. Administration of the schemes will be carried out by the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>, which is an executive agency of the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and part of the same controller. I have seen a copy of the full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-zero-emission-vehicles/about/personal-information-charter"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> privacy policy</a>, which includes the information <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> collects, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, it will be shared with other parties.</li>
  <li>I understand that installers collecting personal data from customers are also considered a ‘data controller’ and should follow their obligations for managing personal data accordingly. Manufacturers and/or their appointed third-party service providers are the data controllers of the data flowing to/from the chargepoint for smart chargers and it is not <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>’s responsibility to determine how they process customer data. Always read the terms and conditions carefully</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ongoing commitments</h3>

<p>Applicants must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain the chargepoint for a minimum of 3 years (including providing evidence of a 3-year on-site warranty on parts and installation)</li>
  <li>ensure measures are in place with the chargepoint operator to provide usage data to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> (in an anonymised form and in accordance with data protection legislation) to guide future policy development. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/commercial-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">Commercial chargepoints: minimum technical specification</a> for more information</li>
  <li>retain all documentation pertaining to the installation for a minimum of 3 years, including:
    <ul>
      <li>installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates</li>
      <li>invoices</li>
      <li>declarations and signatures</li>
      <li>dates of installations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants must be able to provide the above in electronic form to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> if requested.</p>

<h4>Warranty requirements</h4>

<p>All chargepoints must have a minimum 3-year on-site warranty on parts and installation from the chargepoint manufacturer in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/commercial-chargepoints-minimum-technical-specification">Commercial chargepoints: minimum technical specification</a>.</p>

<p>You may provide your own chargepoint if it is on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-approved-chargepoint-model-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved commercial chargepoint model list</a> and you have a manufacturer’s 3-year on-site warranty. However, such equipment will not be eligible for a grant under the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The installer may claim only for the cost of labour and other parts provided for the installation. If the chargepoint is on the approved list, the installer can claim for the cost of the chargepoint, too.</p>

<h4>Auditing</h4>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will involve a third-party organisation to audit claims and determine compliance with the scheme’s rules, which will require access to <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr> data, statements and records held by the applicant and chargepoint installer.</p>

<p>Occasionally, there may be an on-site visit that will require access to the chargepoint itself.</p>

<h4>Tax</h4>

<p>Since 6 April 2018, if you provide your employees with workplace facilities to charge an <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> used by them (including as a passenger), you will not be taxed on the cost of electricity if certain conditions are met. You can find more information in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim01035"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Employment Income Manual</a>.</p>

<p>Businesses can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual/ca23156">potentially claim 100% of the costs of installing an electric vehicle charging point as a capital allowance</a>. Some of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/super-deduction">expenditure may also qualify for the new super deduction</a>, equating to a 130% enhanced deduction of the total cost.</p>

<h4>Moving an existing chargepoint</h4>

<p>The chargepoint may be moved, but <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will not contribute to the cost of doing this.</p>

<h4>Decommissioning of chargepoints</h4>

<p>If the chargepoint needs to be removed or taken out of commission within this 3-year period, the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> must be informed with a brief explanation why at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk">workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk</a>. This may result in the grant being reclaimed.</p>

<h3>Help with wider responsibilities of property owners and managers</h3>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" rel="external">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</a> requires property managers and owners to assess potential fire risks and put in place adequate and proportionate fire protection measures to mitigate against the risk to life from fire and then maintain them. This should be updated when installing <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints.</p>

<p>The government will produce guidance to aid this assessment for electric vehicle fires, available in early 2022. This will identify mitigations and measures that can be taken when installing electric vehicle chargepoints in enclosed car parks. As such it will help building owners meet their existing duties under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information you need to provide during the application</h3>

<p>You must apply using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-application-form">online application form</a>. You will need to provide the following in your application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your contact details</li>
  <li>evidence of your <a class="govuk-link" href="#applicant-evidence">applicant</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#site-evidence">site</a> eligibility</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to appeal if your application is unsuccessful</h3>

<p>If your application is unsuccessful, you may appeal by emailing the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk">workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk</a>. Your case will be reviewed by a manager. The outcome of this appeal is final.</p>

<h3>Voucher code details and validity</h3>

<p>If your application is successful, you will be issued with a voucher by email. This will contain a unique code, which will need to be referenced in subsequent documentation related to the scheme. It will also give:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your contact details</li>
  <li>the installation site(s)</li>
  <li>the expiry date</li>
  <li>the number of sockets and sites for which the voucher is valid</li>
</ul>

<p>The voucher will be valid for 6 months (180 days).</p>

<h4>If the installation (or part of it) cannot be completed by your voucher’s expiry date</h4>

<p>If the installation cannot be completed within the 6-month period specified on the voucher, you will need to email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk">workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk</a> to withdraw your application and reapply for a new voucher. Vouchers are non-transferable.</p>

<p>If some chargepoints on your voucher have been completed by the expiry date but others have not, your installer will need to claim the installations completed and you will need to reapply for a new voucher for the remaining installations not yet completed. In these circumstances, installations completed before the new voucher has been issued will not be eligible.</p>

<h4>If your circumstances have changed</h4>

<p>If your circumstances have changed since you originally applied to the <abbr title="Workplace Charging Scheme">WCS</abbr>, you must contact your authorised installer to inform them of what has changed. They will be able to tell you whether you are still eligible to have a chargepoint installed. You may have to reapply for a voucher with your amended details.</p>

<p>If you proceed with your installation following a change in your circumstances that has invalidated your application, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to take any action it deems appropriate to reclaim the grant.</p>

<h4>How to change the site(s) of your intended installation</h4>

<p>It is not possible to change the site where you wish to install the chargepoints. Vouchers are non-transferable.</p>

<p>If you wish to change the site(s) where the chargepoints are due to be installed, you will need to email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk">workplacechargingscheme@dvla.gov.uk</a> and request to withdraw your current voucher and reapply for a new voucher at your preferred site address.</p>

<h4>Installation of subsequent chargepoints</h4>

<p>If, for example, a site survey shows greater space and scope for chargepoint installations than was originally anticipated, or you have identified an increased need following an initial installation of chargepoint sockets, you may apply for subsequent vouchers for additional chargepoints and sites – provided your cumulative total does not exceed 40 sockets.</p>

<p>For instance, if 10 chargepoint sockets were initially claimed, you will be eligible for 30 further sockets.</p>

<h3>How to make a complaint</h3>

<p>If you have any issues with the chargepoint or installer at any time prior, during and after the installation, you should try to resolve these with your authorised chargepoint installer in the first instance.</p>

<p>If you feel that your concerns are not being addressed, contact <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:chargepoint.grants@ozev.gov.uk">chargepoint.grants@ozev.gov.uk</a>.</p>

      <li>photographs</li>
      <li>applicant declarations, signatures and full address</li>
      <li>dates of installation</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Installers must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>charge applicants for the grant in advance of payment being made by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>inflate the costs of the chargepoints to benefit from a higher grant level</li>
  <li>use the grant to cross-subsidise costs incurred in other parts of its business</li>
  <li>apply for the voucher on the applicant’s behalf (such as by using installer’s name as the name of the business and listing the applicant’s address as one of the installation sites on the voucher application)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any evidence of non-compliance with the above will be acted on by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> and <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to withhold payment from installers where necessary.</p>

<h2>Manufacturer responsibilities</h2>

<p>It’s the manufacturer’s responsibility to ensure that a <a class="govuk-link" href="#warranty">valid 3-year on-site warranty</a> is provided to the applicant – either via the installer or directly – at the time of installation.</p>

<p>If the manufacturer plans to meet <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>’s warranty requirements through partners, resellers or installers, this must be explained in the warranty document.</p>

<p>The manufacturer is expected to honour this warranty by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing on-site assistance to applicants</li>
  <li>attempting to repair chargepoints directly at the applicant’s site(s) – should this not be possible or if additional work is required, manufacturers must either attempt to fix the chargepoint at their own premises or replace it at no extra cost to the applicant</li>
</ul>

<p>If the manufacturer requires the applicant to return parts of the chargepoint to them, the applicant is not liable for the costs associated with doing so.</p>
