<h3>Nationality requirements</h3>

<p>The Civil Service Nationality Rules are written into law, they are exempt from the Equality Act 2010 and must be followed.  They outline who can and cannot work in the Civil Service.</p>

<p>In summary from 1st January 2021 broadly the following groups will be able to work in the non-reserved posts within the Civil Service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK nationals</li>
  <li>Nationals of Commonwealth countries</li>
  <li>Nationals of the Republic of Ireland</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> nationals with (or eligible for) status under the <abbr title="EU Settlement Scheme">EUSS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Relevant <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Turkish nationals working in the Civil Service</li>
  <li>Relevant <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Turkish nationals who have built up the right to work in the Civil Service</li>
  <li>Certain family members of the relevant EU &amp; Turkish nationals</li>
</ul>

<p>A reserved post can be filled only by UK Nationals. A non-reserved post is open to nationals from the countries and associations of countries outlined above.  These posts are non-reserved posts.</p>

<p>If you fail to follow these rules the appointment will be deemed illegal. Your appointee’s employment will be terminated with immediate effect.</p>

<p>GRS check candidates against the nationality rules as part of the pre-employment.</p>

<h3>Right to work: Immigration requirements</h3>

<p>You must have the right to work in the United Kingdom and meet the Immigration and Visa requirements for the scheme.</p>

<p>Further details can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration">Gov.uk Visas and Immigration page</a></p>

<p>Before the appointment of the successful candidate can be confirmed, the Department will undertake background security checks. As part of this, we will need to confirm your identity, course details over the past three years (or employment details if you were in employment), nationality and immigration status, and criminal record (unspent convictions only).</p>

<p>All employees must meet the Baseline Personnel Security Standard (<abbr title="Baseline Personnel Security Standard">BPSS</abbr>). This is a series of basic security checks to confirm identity, right to work in the UK, employment history &amp; where relevant, details of any criminal record. Successful candidates must meet the security requirements before they can be appointed.</p>

<p>Additionally, some roles within the Government will require you to successfully complete National Security Vetting at Counter Terrorism (<abbr title="Counter Terrorism Check">CTC</abbr>), Security Clearance (<abbr title="Security Clearance">SC</abbr>), or Developed Vetting (<abbr title="Developed Vetting">DV</abbr>) level as a condition of appointment.</p>

<p>To meet <abbr title="Counter Terrorism Check">CTC</abbr>, <abbr title="Security Clearance">SC</abbr> or <abbr title="Developed Vetting">DV</abbr> requirements you will normally need to have been resident in the UK for at least 3, 5 or 10 years prior to the date of application (the level of checks that are required are stated in the advert; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels">more information on the levels can be found here</a> ). If you do not satisfy the residency criteria, an application may be submitted and a decision will be made on a case by case basis; consideration will be given to where you lived, how long you were out of the UK and why you were abroad.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a role requiring security clearance, please be aware that foreign or dual nationality is not an automatic bar. However certain posts may have restrictions which could affect those who do not have sole British nationality or who have personal connections with certain countries outside the UK.</p>

<h4>All offers of employment are conditional on successful completion of <abbr title="Baseline Personnel Security Standard">BPSS</abbr> and National Security Vetting. Candidates should not resign from their current job until these checks have been successfully completed.</h4>

<h3>What would I do?</h3>

<p>Government social researchers play a critical role in gathering analysing and interpreting the information that forms the foundation for decision-making affecting every UK resident. As a Research Officer working for a civil service organisation you can contribute to the reporting of social trends, the development of government policy and evaluation of how policies make a difference to public services. Your work might involve developing surveys, analysing data, producing statistics, reviewing existing research evidence and working with other analysts in government to provide timely, relevant and robust briefing for policy colleagues and Ministers.</p>

<h3>Social Researchers working in departments and agencies</h3>

<p>To find out more on the work of social researchers in some of the departments, please see the job specification documents at the top of this page.</p>

<h3>Allocation to a <abbr title="Government Social Research Service">GSR</abbr> department</h3>

<p>You will be assigned into a department for your first posting within the <abbr title="Government Social Research Service">GSR</abbr>, with an expectation of staying in this department for two years.</p>

<p>We will take into consideration candidates’ preferences on department/location but may not be able to fulfil these on all occasions. It is worth noting that any role in the Civil Service will be a rewarding opportunity.</p>

<h3>Knowledge test</h3>

<p>You will be invited to attend a <abbr title="Government Social Research Service">GSR</abbr> Knowledge Test after the closing date. Full details of this test will be provided to candidates who reach this stage.</p>

<h3>The Interview</h3>

<p>This will consist of a blended interview, which should take approximately an hour including a 5 minute presentation with follow up questions to assess your technical professional skills as a Social Researcher, in line with the whole <abbr title="Government Social Research Service">GSR</abbr> Technical Framework at <abbr title="Research Officer">RO</abbr> level.  At interview you will also be asked questions based on the following Civil Service Behaviours: Working Together, Managing a Quality Service, Communicating and Influencing.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/717275/CS_Behaviours_2018.pdf" rel="external">Civil Service Behaviours framework can be found here</a> and further guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/success-profiles">Success Profiles can be found on Civil Service Jobs here</a>.</p>

<p>An example of a Behavioural question would be: Tell me about a time when you’ve had to deal with a difficult customer. It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in, and use the WHO or STAR model to explain: What  was the task, How you approached the work/situation and what the Outcomes were, what did you achieve? Or What was the Situation? That were the Tasks? What Action did you take? What were the Results of your actions?</p>

<h3>How much would I earn?</h3>

<p>Salaries vary between departments. The average starting salary in London is about £29,000.</p>

<h4>The Civil Service is committed to becoming the most inclusive employer in the UK.</h4>

<p>We are committed to understanding, respecting and representing as broad a range of views and backgrounds as we have in UK society. We know that diverse perspectives and experiences are critical to an effective, modern Civil Service.
