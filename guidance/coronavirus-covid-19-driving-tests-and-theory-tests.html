<h3>If your driving test is affected</h3>

<p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) will contact you if your test is affected and tell you what you need to do.</p>

<h2>Booking a driving test</h2>

<p>You can still <a href="https://www.gov.uk/book-driving-test" class="govuk-link">book your driving test</a> online.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If you’re a driving instructor, you can still <a href="https://www.gov.uk/book-pupil-driving-test" class="govuk-link">book tests for your pupils</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you cannot wear a face covering</h2>

<p>When you arrange your test, you’ll need to say if there’s a <a href="#wearing-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">good reason you cannot wear a face covering</a> when you take your test.</p>

<p>You might not be able to take a test at your prefered test centre.</p>

<h2>When you come for your driving test</h2>

<p>Do not arrive for your driving test more than 5 minutes before your appointment time.</p>

<p>Some driving test centre waiting rooms are closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Your driving instructor or accompanying driver can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/driving-test-centre-waiting-rooms-during-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">check if the waiting room will be open</a> before your test.</p>

<p>Toilets are available on request, even if the waiting room is closed.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/101047/do-not-arrive-more-than-5-minutes-early.jpg" alt="Graphic of a clock with a caption that says 'Do not arrive more than 5 minutes before your appointment time'"></div></figure>

<h3>Rules for the car you use</h3>

<p>You must clean the inside of your car before your test. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tidying any unnecessary items away from the dashboard, footwells, door pockets, cup holders and seats</li>
  <li>wiping down the dashboard and car controls</li>
</ul>

<p>The examiner will do an additional clean of some surfaces.</p>

<p>The car you use for your test must have at least one window open on each side throughout the test. Any combination of windows can be opened - for example, one from the front and one from the back. Wear clothing suitable for the weather.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-test/using-your-own-car" class="govuk-link">Check all the rules the car you use must meet</a>.</p>

<h3>Safety precautions</h3>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> has introduced safety precautions. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>driving examiners wearing face coverings - they might also choose to wear gloves and use disposable seat covers</li>
  <li>limiting the number of people arriving for a driving test at the same time</li>
  <li>not allowing your driving instructor or supervising driver to sit in the back during your test</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wearing a face covering</h3>

<p>You must bring and wear a face covering when you come for your test, unless you have a good reason not to. This includes if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a physical or mental illness or impairment, or a disability that means you cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering</li>
  <li>putting on, wearing or removing a face covering would cause you severe distress</li>
  <li>you need to remove it during your test to avoid harm or injury or the risk of harm or injury to yourself or others</li>
</ul>

<h4>If you wear glasses</h4>

<p>Wearing glasses does not count as a good reason not to wear a face covering. You should practise driving wearing a face covering before your test to help you prepare.</p>

<h4>When you arrange your test</h4>

<p>You need to say if you have a good reason not to wear a face covering when you arrange your test.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" role="note" aria-label="Warning">
<p>Your test will be cancelled if you come for your test without a face covering and you did not declare you could not wear one when you arranged your test.</p>
</div>

<p>You will need to remove your face covering briefly so your driving examiner can check your ID.</p>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering">how to wear and make a cloth face covering</a>.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/101115/wear-face-covering.jpg" alt="Graphic of a face covering with a caption that says 'Bring and wear a face covering unless you have a good reason not to'"></div></figure>

<h2>During your driving test</h2>

<p>If you have a problem with your face covering during the test, your driving examiner will ask you to stop so you can adjust it. Your driving examiner will end the test early if it becomes a safety issue.</p>

<h3>If you make a mistake</h3>

<p>You can carry on if you make a mistake during your driving test.</p>

<p>If you make a serious or dangerous fault, which means you’ve failed, your driving examiner will direct you back to the driving test centre, where the test will end. This is to minimise the amount of time you need to spend in the vehicle.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-test/what-happens-during-test" class="govuk-link">Find out more about how the car driving test works</a>.</p>

<h2>At the end of your test</h2>

<p>Your driving examiner will ask if you want your instructor to come over to listen to the feedback, but only if social distancing can be maintained.</p>

<h2>When you must not go to your test</h2>

<p>Do not go to your driving test if:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/" rel="external">you or someone you live with has COVID-19 symptoms</a></li>
  <li>you’ve been told by the NHS Test and Trace service that you’ve been in contact with a person who has COVID-19</li>
  <li>you’re <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control/self-isolating-when-you-arrive" class="govuk-link">self-isolating because you recently entered the UK</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/change-driving-test">Change your test appointment</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/cancel-driving-test">cancel your test</a> if you’re not able to go.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Graphic of a house with a caption that says 'You must not come for your test if you’re self-isolating'" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/101051/self-isolating.jpg"></div></figure>

<h2>If your theory test certificate expires</h2>

<p>You need to have passed a theory test in the last 2 years to be able to take most types of driving tests.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" aria-label="Warning" role="note">
<p>Your theory test certificate will not be extended.</p>
</div>

<p>This is because your road safety knowledge and hazard perception skills need to be up to date when you restart driving lessons and take your driving test.</p>
