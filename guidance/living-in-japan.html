<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guide sets out essential information for British nationals residing in Japan, including advice on health, benefits, residence requirements and more.  We are unable to provide any guidance on general lifestyle enquiries apart from the information and links listed below. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-tokyo#our-services">information on what consulates can and cannot do</a> for British nationals.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930005927.pdf" rel="external">Foreign Residents Support Center (FRESC)</a> is a one-stop consultation centre which hosts the offices of eight public organisations which includes the Immigration Services Agency of Japan, the Japan Legal Support Center, the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Visa Information desk, Tokyo Labour Bureau Consultation and Support Office for Foreigners. The centre is open from 9-5 on weekdays, provides consultation services on issues of Visa &amp; Immigration, Legal Support &amp; Employment, in English, Chinese and 9 other languages, utilising remote interpreters when necessary via videolink.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>

<p>Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/0000164708_00079.html" rel="external">Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s coronavirus page</a> for an overview of the current situation in Japan.</p>

<p>We are not advising British people who are permanent residents overseas to return to the UK. You should follow the advice of the local authorities in your host country. You can also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/japan/staying-during-coronavirus">travel advice</a> for our latest guidance.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Japan, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/japan/coronavirus#covid-19-vaccines-if-you-live-in-japan">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>British nationals who have resident or student status in Japan should consider their own personal circumstances and take into account all of the information available, when making a decision on whether or not to return to the UK. You may consider the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Financial support: do you have sufficient funds to support yourself without going back to the UK for an undetermined number of months? Check the Finance section below for more information.</li>
  <li>Health Insurance: If you were instructed by the authorities to undergo COVID-19 PCR testing, all testing and COVID-19 related medical costs are borne by the Japanese government. The government however does not bear any non COVID-19 medical costs. Do you have medical coverage? Taking your own personal health condition into account, are you confident in receiving the necessary support you need in Japan? Check the Health section below for more information.</li>
  <li>Legal &amp; employment support: do you understand the kind of support available to you in the case of unemployment or economic hardships due to COVID-19? Will these support mechanisms be sufficient for you to support yourself for an undetermined number of months? Check the Legal and Employment section below for more information.</li>
  <li>For students: do you understand the arrangements your host university has in place? Particularly access to medical facilities, accommodation and online learning options. Keep in contact with your UK university too (if applicable) about their advice.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have COVID-19 related concerns on entering Japan and returning to the UK, please refer to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/japan/coronavirus">coronavirus specific travel advice</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Health</h2>
<p>British nationals resident in Japan should consider contacting their local ward or city office about what healthcare options may be available and/or refer to JNTO’s guide to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html" rel="external">accessing medical facilities in Japan</a>.</p>

<p>See also, list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/japan-list-of-doctors-and-medical-facilities">medical facilities in Japan</a>.</p>

<p>For non-residents, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/japan/health">Travel Advice</a> for further information.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of many individuals in unforeseen ways. If you are under mental duress, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://telljp.com/" rel="external">TELL</a> (click <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/telljapan/" rel="external">here</a> for daily service hours for both chat and phone services) provides support and counselling services to Japan’s international community. Befrienders Worldwide also offers emotional support services worldwide. So, if you would like to speak to volunteers in the UK instead, see information on available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.befrienders.org/directory?country=United+Kingdom" rel="external">24/7 UK helplines</a>.</p>

<p>If you are experiencing or know of someone who is a victim of domestic violence and abuse, non-profit organisation <a class="govuk-link" href="https://soudanplus.jp/" rel="external">DV Soudan+</a> supports victims by operating a hotline available in 10 different languages, provides professional consultation services as well as shelter. Another organisation <a class="govuk-link" href="https://en.kyofukai.jp/about-us/facilities/help/" rel="external">HELP</a> (House in Emergency of Love and Peace) supports women and children regardless of race, visa status and nationality. They provide shelter with English consultations available. Lastly, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www1.tokyo-womens-plaza.metro.tokyo.jp/consult/tabid/256/Default.aspx" rel="external">Tokyo Women’s Plaza</a> also runs a free telephone consultation service in multiple languages.</p>

<p>Further information on mental health support in Japan can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-support-for-british-nationals-in-japan/mental-health-support-for-british-nationals-in-japan">here</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Coronavirus</h3>

<p>If you suspect you have COVID-19, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has published a  <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.covid19-info.jp/" rel="external">multilingual guide</a> on actions to take. Also included are information on precautions to take to prevent the further spread of the virus, as well as information on local call centres. More detailed guidance on preventive measures published by the same ministry can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/kenkou-iryousoudan_00006.html#1-1" rel="external">here</a> as well.<br></p>

<p>The government of Japan have stated that they are currently covering all costs related to hospitalisation for COVID-19, regardless of nationality. The Japanese authorities expects patients to follow the formal reporting process in place.<br></p>

<p>If you have not been approved for the PCR test by Japanese health officials, some private clinics are now offering PCR testing for a fee. Should you test negative, you will have to bear the full cost for this test but if you test positive, the government will cover the cost of this test and subsequent COVID-19 related medical costs. <br></p>

<p>Please be aware that Japanese government expects residents no longer covered by Japanese national insurance and unable to go back to the UK, to pay for non COVID-19 medical costs themselves.</p>
</div>

<h2>Visa &amp; Immigration</h2>

<p>Please check the validity of your visa and if you have any concerns with your visa status in Japan, and see <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.moj.go.jp/EN/nyuukokukanri/kouhou/m_nyuukokukanri01_00003.html" rel="external">information regarding visa and immigration</a> as published by the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p>With visa renewal, length of extension is assessed case by case by the Japanese authorities. Please check with your regional immigration office regarding specific requirements before starting on any application process. Due to the high volume of inquiries, it may take some time to reach the relevant authorities.  We would recommend you to enquire by phone at the first instance as the Immigration Services Agency advises customers to avoid coming in unless necessary.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/info/index.html" rel="external">contact information of local immigration authorities</a>.</p>

<p>If you require further information and support, the <a class="govuk-link" href="#eel-decline">Foreign Residents Support Center</a> provides consultation services in English and other languages.</p>

<h2>Government Benefits</h2>
<p>Japan has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/Jasos2001/p7-15.html#:~:text=There%20are%20three%20types%20of,each%20firm's%20individual%20pension%20scheme" rel="external">three-tier pension system</a> and participation in the national pension system <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nenkin.go.jp/international/japanese-system/nationalpension/nationalpension.html" rel="external">“Basic Pension”</a> is mandatory for most.</p>

<p>To find out about what benefits you may be entitled to in Japan, you should contact your local ward or city office.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/benefits-if-you-are-abroad">information on benefits</a> you might be able to get while being abroad and how to claim them.</p>

<p>You need to tell the relevant government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax that you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>New policy on proof of ‘Life Certificates’</h3>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has changed their policy on who can now sign these ‘Life Certificates’. This now reflects the list of people who can countersign a passport photograph. Please read the DWP’s guide <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">state pension if you retire abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Given the restrictions on courier services worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the time period for Life Certificates to be submitted has been extended to 16 weeks (with the potential for further extension). However, at present, no pensions will be suspended for customers who have been issued a Life Certificate.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension Centre</a> is now able to approve Life Certificates over the telephone. Applicants must pass some basic security questions regarding their account, such as how much they receive and when. If you are unable to call on your own, a three-way call can be initiated by family, friends, or the British Embassy. In these cases, the relevant third party should contact the International Pension Centre and they will add you to the call (interpreters are available if required). If you are unable to get through to the International Pension Centre, you can email them and request a call back.</p>

<h2>Driving licences and vehicles</h2>
<p>See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/japan/safety-and-security">Travel Advice</a> for general information on driving licences in Japan.  If you intend to stay in Japan for longer than one year, you should apply for a Japanese driving licence. For more information and details of offices where you can convert your UK driving license to a Japanese license, visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.jaf.or.jp/e/" rel="external">Japanese Automobile Federation website</a>.</p>
