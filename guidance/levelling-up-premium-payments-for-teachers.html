<h2>Eligibility criteria for teachers</h2>

<p>You must meet the eligibility criteria to be able to claim any additional payments.</p>

<p>Once the claim window opens in autumn 2022, you will be able to answer some questions to find out what additional payments you are eligible to claim.</p>

<p>You will only be able to claim either an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-career-payments-guidance-for-teachers-and-schools">early-career payment</a> or levelling up premium payment per academic year, even if you are eligible to claim for both payments.</p>

<p>Learn more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/additional-payments-for-teaching-eligibility-and-payment-details">what additional payments are available</a>.</p>

<h3>School eligibility</h3>

<p>Levelling up premium payments will be offered in schools identified as having a high need for teachers. If you teach in an eligible school in an Education Investment Area, you will receive a higher payment.</p>

<h4>Methodology</h4>

<p>We have produced a <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1074856/Levelling_up_premium_methodology.pdf">methodology document</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">148 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">2 pages</span>)</span> which explains our funding approach.</p>

<h3>Qualifications</h3>

<p>To claim, you must have completed at least one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> course specialising in mathematics, physics, chemistry or computing</li>
  <li>training to get qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>) through assessment only or overseas recognition in an eligible academic year</li>
  <li>a UK undergraduate or postgraduate degree related to mathematics, physics, chemistry and computing on the JACS 3.0 principal subject codes or with a relevant <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1074765/LUP_eligible_JACS3_HECoS_codes_list.ods">higher education classification of subjects (HECoS) code</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="OpenDocument Spreadsheet">ODS</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">11.6 KB</span>)</span>
</li>
  <li>an equivalent non-UK degree</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and <abbr title="qualified teacher learning and skills">QTLS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>To claim a payment in the academic year 2022 to 2023, you must have one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts#qualified-teacher-learning-and-skills-qtls">qualified teacher learning and skills (<abbr title="qualified teacher learning and skills">QTLS</abbr>)</a> status and membership of the Society for Education and Training (SET)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must have started a postgraduate <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> course or completed an undergraduate <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> course in the 2017 to 2018 to the 2021 to 2022 academic years.</p>

<p>The academic year runs from 1 September to 31 August.</p>

<h3>Employment</h3>

<p>You must be employed as a teacher in a state-funded secondary school in England when you apply for the payment. State-funded secondary schools include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authority-maintained secondary schools (including middle-deemed secondary schools)</li>
  <li>academies, free schools or multi-academy trusts</li>
  <li>special schools (local authority-maintained or non-maintained)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must have spent at least 50% of your contracted hours allocated to teaching one or more of the eligible subjects at the time of the application.</p>

<h3>Supply, private school and sixth-form college teachers</h3>

<p>If you are a supply teacher, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be employed directly by the school</li>
  <li>have been working for at least one term before applying</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot come from a private agency.</p>

<p>If you teach in a private school or sixth-form college, you are not eligible.</p>

<h3>Part-time teachers</h3>

<p>If you are a part-time teacher, you are eligible for the same levelling up premium payment amounts as full-time teachers.</p>

<p>You still need to meet the same eligibility criteria in full.</p>

<h3>Breaks in teaching</h3>

<p>You are allowed to have some breaks in your normal employment which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sickness, maternity, paternity, parental or adoption leave</li>
  <li>annual leave</li>
  <li>time between unfair dismissal and an employee being reinstated</li>
  <li>military service, for example with a reserve force</li>
  <li>temporary lay-offs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>You must not currently be subject to any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>formal performance measures as a result of continuous poor teaching standards</li>
  <li>disciplinary action</li>
</ul>

<h2>Payments and deductions</h2>

<h3>Number of payments</h3>

<p>You can only claim one additional payment in each academic year, even if you are eligible for more than one type of additional payment.</p>

<p>For example, if you are eligible for both the levelling up premium and early career payments, you can only claim one of these additional payments in the same academic year.</p>

<p>However, if you are eligible to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/additional-payments-for-teaching-eligibility-and-payment-details">claim back your student loan repayments</a>, you will be able to claim this as well as a levelling up premium payment or early-career payment.</p>

<h3>Paying Income Tax and National Insurance</h3>

<p>The levelling up premium payment is considered taxable income.</p>

<p>The Department for Education will pay Income Tax up to basic rate (currently earnings of Â£12,571 to Â£50,270, taxed rate 20%) and National Insurance for the payment on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you become or already are a higher rate taxpayer, any additional Income Tax and National Insurance contributions for this payment over the higher rate will remain your responsibility. The higher rate is currently earnings of Â£50,271 to Â£150,000, taxed rate 40%.</p>

<p>The Department for Education is not liable to reimburse tax at the higher rate.</p>

<p>Please review the tax bands updated on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates">Income Tax rates and Personal Allowances</a>.</p>

<p>The payment is not part of your salary from your employer. You, your employer, or the government will not make a contribution to your pension as part of this payment.</p>

<p>Please consider any other benefits or tax credits that could be affected if you claim this payment.</p>

<h3>Student loan deductions</h3>

<p>If you have a student loan you are currently paying off, a deduction will go towards repaying your student loan. This is taken from your payment automatically.</p>
