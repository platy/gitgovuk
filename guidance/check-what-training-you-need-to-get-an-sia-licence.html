<p>Before you apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-if-you-need-an-sia-licence#licence-types">front line SIA licence</a>, you need to train for a ‘licence-linked’ qualification. This is so we can be sure you have the skills and knowledge you need to hold a licence and do your job safely.</p>

<p>You do not need a licence-linked qualification to get a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-if-you-need-an-sia-licence#licence-types">non-front line licence</a> or a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-if-you-need-an-sia-licence#licensable-activities">key holding licence</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have successfully got the qualification you need for a front line licence, the awarding organisation will tell us. We must get this notification before you can submit your licence application. Otherwise, you will not be able to submit the application.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a licence for the first time, you must have got your qualification within the last 3 years.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a licence you have held before, you need to get a new qualification if it is longer than 3 years since your old licence was active.</p>

<h2>Search for a training provider</h2>

<p>You must get your training from an approved training provider. These are providers that have been approved by awarding organisations that offer SIA-licence-linked qualifications.</p>

<p>We do not give training ourselves. We do not get any money from training providers’ course fees.</p>
