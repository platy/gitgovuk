<p>Applications are normally processed in date order from when your documents were uploaded, or after your appointment at a visa application centre. We are working 7 days a week, but it will take some time before we can issue decisions to everyone who has applied.
<br><br>
We know that some applicants have been waiting for nearly 3 weeks for their application to be processed. We are working to resolve this and speed up the processing of applications.</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme allows Ukrainian nationals and their family members to come to the UK if they have a named sponsor who can provide accommodation.</p>

<p>It is free to apply.</p>

<p>You will be able to live, work and study in the UK and access public funds.</p>

<p>If you are Ukrainian and need assistance completing this application, please call the 24/7 free helpline +44 808 164 8810 (0808 164 8810 if you’re in the UK).</p>

<p>If you cannot contact UK 0808 numbers, please use +44 (0)175 390 7510.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>To apply to the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme you must be Ukrainian, or the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national, and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>18 or older on the date of application</li>
  <li>under 18 years old and applying with your parent or legal guardian, or to join them in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been residing in Ukraine on or immediately before 1 January 2022 (including those who have now left Ukraine)</li>
  <li>be outside of the UK</li>
  <li>have an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/homes-for-ukraine-sponsor-guidance">eligible UK-based sponsor</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your UK-based sponsor does not need to register with the Homes for Ukraine Scheme if you’re already in contact with them.</p>
</div>

<p>An immediate family member is your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>unmarried partner (you must have been living together in a relationship for at least 2 years)</li>
  <li>child who is under 18</li>
  <li>parent (if you are under 18)</li>
  <li>fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner</li>
</ul>

<p>You and your sponsor will be subject to security and safeguarding checks.</p>

<p>If your intended sponsor is based in the Bailiwick of Guernsey, Isle of Man or Jersey, they should contact the relevant authority listed below before you make an application. They will need to check the details of the sponsorship schemes available in those jurisdictions, which may differ from that provided by the UK government:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bailiwick of Guernsey (Guernsey, Alderney and Sark): <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ukraine@gov.gg">ukraine@gov.gg</a>
</li>
  <li>Isle of Man: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ukraineguidance@gov.im">ukraineguidance@gov.im</a>
</li>
  <li>Jersey: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ukraine@gov.je">ukraine@gov.je</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How long you can stay</h2>

<p>You can stay in the UK for up to 3 years.</p>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>It is free to apply.</p>

<p>You do not need to pay the immigration health surcharge or biometric enrolment fee.</p>

<h2>Apply</h2>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply.visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/apply-visa-type/ukraine-scheme-ooc" rel="external">apply online</a>.</p>

<p>To support you in applying for the Ukraine Family Scheme or the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme (Homes for Ukraine), we have translated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukraine-family-scheme-and-ukraine-sponsorship-scheme-application-screens">application screens</a> to Ukrainian and Russian.</p>

<p>You and your sponsor can fill in the form together.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The form is aimed at the person applying to the scheme. If you are a sponsor applying on behalf of a person coming from Ukraine, you should provide their details first. The section for providing your details as a sponsor comes later on in the form.</p>
</div>

<p>This application is also an application for a biometric immigration document.</p>

<p>By completing this application, you confirm that both the applicant and the sponsor have given permission for their data to be shared and contact details used for the purpose of checks and supporting the sponsor arrangement.</p>

<h3>If you hold a valid Ukrainian international passport or an expired Ukrainian international passport with a formal extension stamp issued by the Ukrainian government</h3>

<p>If you hold a valid Ukrainian international passport or an expired Ukrainian international passport with a formal extension stamp issued by the Ukrainian government, you will need to complete an application online, but you do not need to attend an appointment at a visa application centre (VAC) to give your biometric information.</p>

<h3>Uploading your documents</h3>

<p>During the application process you will be asked to upload a copy of the photograph page of your valid or expired Ukrainian international passport.</p>

<p>If you are applying with an expired Ukrainian international passport, you must upload a copy of the page where the formal extension stamp issued by the Ukrainian government is shown.</p>

<p>You will be asked to provide documents that show the identity of your UK-based sponsor.</p>

<p>This can be a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK or Irish passport or Irish passport card</li>
  <li>biometric residence permit or biometric residence card</li>
  <li>refugee travel document</li>
  <li>a photo driving licence issued by the UK, Ireland, or the Crown Dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>If your sponsor has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-your-uk-visas-and-immigration-account">UKVI account</a>, they can use the online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status">View and prove service</a> to show their identity.</p>

<p>It is not mandatory to provide these documents but it may help support your application if you are able to.</p>

<p>You can upload your documents using our commercial partner document upload app. This will be either TLS or VFS depending on which country you are applying in. You can download the app from the TLS or VFS website when you make your application.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you need support to upload images of your documents, you can book an appointment at a VAC.</p>
</div>

<p>You will also be asked to provide your sponsor’s residential address.</p>

<h3>Official permission letter</h3>

<p>Once your application has been processed you will receive an official permission letter from UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) confirming that you can travel to the UK.</p>

<p>The permission letter will allow you to board a plane or other form of transport to the UK.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You should not travel to the UK until you have received an official permission letter.</p>
</div>

<h3>At the UK border</h3>

<p>Border Force, airlines and carriers will be informed that customers with valid Ukrainian passports who have been accepted under the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme will be issued with a letter confirming they have permission to travel to the UK without a UK visa in their passport.</p>

<p>When you arrive in the UK, you will need to show your permission letter to Border Force officers who will endorse your passport with a 6-month entry stamp.</p>

<p>The 6-month entry stamp is evidence of your right to work, study and claim benefits in the UK.</p>

<h3>Extending your stay in the UK</h3>

<p>You will need to submit your biometrics within 6 months of arriving in the UK to extend your stay for up to 3 years and be issued with a biometric residence permit (BRP) as evidence of your immigration status.</p>

<p>You can start the process to provide your biometric information by completing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://apply.visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/ukraine-scheme-brp" rel="external">online form</a>.</p>

<p>Once we have received your details, we will tell you how to provide your biometric information.</p>

<p>You do not need to do this as soon as you reach the UK, but you do need to make sure that you have provided your biometrics before the 6 months leave you are granted ends.</p>

<h3>If you do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport</h3>

<p>If you do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport you will need to book and attend an appointment at a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre">visa application centre</a>.</p>

<h3>Uploading your documents</h3>

<p>During the application process you will be asked to provide one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ukrainian National identity card</li>
  <li>a combination of official documents – for example, a photo driving licence and birth certificate</li>
  <li>an emergency certificate issued by a Ukrainian authority since March 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also provide documents that show the identity of your UK-based sponsor. This can be a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK or Irish passport or Irish passport card</li>
  <li>biometric residence permit or biometric residence card</li>
  <li>refugee travel document</li>
  <li>a photo driving licence issued by the UK, Ireland, or the Crown Dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>If your sponsor has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-your-uk-visas-and-immigration-account">UKVI account</a>, they can use the online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status">View and prove service</a> to show their identity.</p>

<p>It is not mandatory to provide these documents but it may help support your application if you are able to.</p>

<p>You can upload your documents using our commercial partner document upload app. This will be either TLS or VFS depending on which country you are applying in. You can download the app from the TLS or VFS website when you make your application.</p>

<p>You will also be asked to provide your sponsor’s residential address.</p>

<h3>Visa application centres (VACs)</h3>

<p>You will need to have your photograph and fingerprints taken at a VAC as part of your application. Children under the age of 5 who do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport will not have their fingerprints taken but will still need to book and attend a VAC appointment and have a digital photograph taken.</p>

<p>You do not need to book an appointment at a VAC to provide your biometric information if you hold a valid Ukrainian international passport.</p>

<h3>Visa application centre availability</h3>

<p>VACs in Ukraine are currently closed. You can apply at a VAC in any country if you are able to travel safely.</p>

<p>There is a temporary VAC for people applying for the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/rze_en/address" rel="external">Rzeszow, Poland</a>. You’ll need to complete your online application and book an appointment before attending the Rzeszow VAC - walk-in appointments are no longer accepted.</p>

<p>VACs are currently operating throughout Europe including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/bud_en/address" rel="external">Budapest, Hungary</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/kiv_en/address" rel="external">Chisinau, Moldova</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/waw_en/address" rel="external">Warsaw, Poland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/bbu_en/address" rel="external">Bucharest, Romania</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://pos.tlscontact.com/par_en/address" rel="external">Paris, France</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Once you’ve submitted your form</h3>

<p>You will need to await a decision from the UK government on your application before travelling.</p>

<p>We are prioritising Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme applications and aim to make a decision as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>You will be contacted when a decision has been made.</p>

<p>If you are granted permission under the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme you will receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an official letter of permission (if you hold a valid Ukrainian international passport)</li>
  <li>a visa (if you attended a visa application centre to give your biometrics)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please do not attend the visa application centre to collect your visa until you have been contacted.</p>

<h3>Contact UK Visas and Immigration</h3>
<p>You can call the free 24/7 helpline on +44 808 164 8810 if you are outside the UK for help with any questions about the scheme.</p>
