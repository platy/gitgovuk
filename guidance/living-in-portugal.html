<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Portugal before 1 January 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<h3>Applying for a biometric card as a resident</h3>

<p>If you were legally resident in Portugal before 1 January 2021, you should exchange your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> resident document for a new biometric card using the Portuguese Border and Immigration Service <a href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">SEFâ€™s Brexit portal</a>.</p>

<p>Register on the portal and download your registration confirmation, in the form of a digital document, with a QR code. This document can be used to prove you are resident in Portugal when entering or exiting the country, until you receive your new biometric card.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residence document will continue to be accepted until the new one arrives or until the end of its validity.</p>

<h3>Registering for residency</h3>

<p>If you have been living in Portugal before 1 January 2021 and have not yet registered, email <a href="mailto:brexit@sef.pt" class="govuk-link">brexit@sef.pt</a>, to request registration.</p>

<p>You must include a scanned copy or photo of your passport, proof of address and proof you were living in Portugal before January 2021.</p>

<p>For more information, check <a href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">SEFâ€™s Brexit portal</a> or phone SEFâ€™s Brexit helpline (+351 21 711 50 45).</p>

<p>For more information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the Border and Immigration Agency (SEF) <a href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on residency rights for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals</a> (in English)</li>

<h3>Additional support</h3>

<h3>Moving to Portugal</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the <a href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/entrada-em-portugal/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Portugal</a>
</li>
  <li>find more information about visas on the <a href="http://www.portugalemlondres.org/imigrar.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Portuguese Consulate in London page</a>

  <li>read the Border and Immigration website for <a href="https://www.sef.pt/en/Pages/homepage.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">information on residency and working in Portugal</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Everyone who is registered as a resident can also register to access the Portuguese national health service (SNS) on the same basis as a Portuguese citizen.</p>

<p>You should ensure you are properly registered for healthcare as a resident in Portugal. Private health insurance is available but is not mandatory and should not be a substitute for registering for state healthcare.</p>

<p>Once you are registered as a resident in Portugal, register at your local health centre (centro de saÃºde) and get a user health number (NÃºmero de Utente de SaÃºde) by showing your residence certificate and your passport.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-portugal-including-madeira" class="govuk-link">guidance on how you can register for healthcare in Portugal and how the healthcare system works</a>. Make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> if you live in Portugal and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are receiving a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pension</li>
  <li>are receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>are a frontier worker who lives in Portugal and commutes to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have been sent to Portugal temporarily by your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> employer</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-portugal-including-madeira#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Portugal</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) and Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Portugal, you must not use your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC to access healthcare in Portugal, unless you are a student or a detached (posted) worker. Current EHICs will remain valid until the expiry date on the card.</p>

<p>If you are living in Portugal you may be eligible for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> student in Portugal</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p>The card you receive will depend on when you moved to Portugal.</p>

<p><a href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Apply now for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC</a>.</p>

<p>You should apply for a Portuguese-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for visits outside of Portugal if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered with Portuguese Social Security (if you are working or the dependent of someone working in Portugal), or</li>
  <li>resident in Portugal and do not have healthcare cover from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or another Member State (for example if you are not entitled to an S1), but have a health number (NÃºmero de Utente de SaÃºde)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Portuguese government has more <a href="https://eportugal.gov.pt/en/servicos/requerer-o-cartao-europeu-de-seguro-de-doenca-da-seguranca-social" rel="external" class="govuk-link">information on how to apply</a>, including an application form which you should complete and hand in at your nearest Social Security office.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<p>For more information read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">guidance on healthcare when travelling in Europe</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#travel-eu">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

</ul>

<p>Send questions about access to healthcare in Portugal to <a href="mailto:healthcare.portugal@fcdo.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">healthcare.portugal@fcdo.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence card, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your card, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence card, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Portugal. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Portugal, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped. This will not affect your rights in Portugal.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Portugal.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You will be able to travel to other <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice</a> page for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Ireland has not changed.</p>
