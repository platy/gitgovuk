</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Portugal before 1 January 2021, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should check that you are correctly registered and should get a new residence document to evidence your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Portugal before 1 January 2021, you should exchange your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> resident document for a new biometric card using <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/">SEFâ€™s Brexit portal</a>.</p>

<p>Register on the portal and download your registration confirmation, in the form of a digital document, with a QR code. This document can be used to prove you are resident in Portugal when entering or exiting the country, until you receive your new biometric card.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residence document will continue to be accepted until the new one arrives or until the end of its validity.</p>

<p>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021 but not yet registered, you need to keep a range of evidence that you arrived with intention to live here. The Portuguese government has not yet announced the process for these registrations. You should regularly check <a href="https://www.sef.pt/en/Pages/homepage.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">SEFâ€™s website</a> for updates and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-portugal" class="govuk-link">sign up for updates</a> to this guidance.</p>

<h3>Additional support</h3>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals who are resident in Portugal before 1 January 2021, and who need help with their residency registration, can get support from organisations funded by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-allocates-3-million-to-support-uk-nationals-in-the-eu"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Nationals Support Fund</a>.</p>

<p>This support is only available to people who need additional help to secure their rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. They may include pensioners, disabled people, people living in remote areas or people who have mobility difficulties. Support available includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>answering questions about residence applications, such as the documents you need and how the application process works</li>
  <li>guiding you through the process, if necessary</li>
  <li>support if you experience language barriers or difficulty accessing online information and services</li>
</ul>

<p>If you, or someone you know, are having difficulty completing residence paperwork or have any questions, contact The International Organisation for Migration (IOM):</p>

<ul>
  <li>visit the <a rel="external" href="https://unitedkingdom.iom.int/uknsf-portugal" class="govuk-link">IOM website</a>

  <li>email: <a href="mailto:UKNationalsPT@iom.int" class="govuk-link">UKNationalsPT@iom.int</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to Portugal</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the <a rel="external" href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/entrada-em-portugal/" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Portugal</a>
</li>
  <li>find more information about visas on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.portugalemlondres.org/imigrar.html" rel="external">Portuguese Consulate in London page</a>

  <li>read the Border and Immigration website for <a href="https://www.sef.pt/en/Pages/homepage.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">information on residency and working in Portugal</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Everyone who is registered as a resident can also register to access the Portuguese national health service (SNS) on the same basis as a Portuguese citizen.</p>

<p>You should ensure you are properly registered for healthcare as a resident in Portugal. Private health insurance is available but is not mandatory and should not be a substitute for registering for state healthcare.</p>

<p>Once you are registered as a resident in Portugal, register at your local health centre (centro de saÃºde) and get a user health number (NÃºmero de Utente de SaÃºde) by showing your residence certificate and your passport.</p>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-portugal-including-madeira">guidance on how you can register for healthcare in Portugal and how the healthcare system works</a>.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> employer has sent you to Portugal temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-portugal-including-madeira#posted-worker">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Portugal and commutes to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-portugal-including-madeira#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Portugal</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Portugal, you must not use your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access healthcare in Portugal, unless you are a student.</p>

<p>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> student in Portugal</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Apply now for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>You should apply for a Portuguese-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for visits outside of Portugal if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered with Portuguese Social Security (if you are working or the dependent of someone working in Portugal), or</li>
  <li>resident in Portugal and do not have healthcare cover from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or another Member State (for example if you are not entitled to an S1), but have a health number (NÃºmero de Utente de SaÃºde)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Portuguese government has more <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://eportugal.gov.pt/en/servicos/requerer-o-cartao-europeu-de-seguro-de-doenca-da-seguranca-social">information on how to apply</a>, including an application form which you should complete and hand in at your nearest Social Security office.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<p>For more information read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare when travelling in Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#travel-eu" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence card, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your card, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence card, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Portugal. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Portugal, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped. This will not affect your rights in Portugal.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Portugal.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Portugal, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You will be able to travel to other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" rel="external">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice</a> page for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>If you are not a resident, you will only pay tax on income that came from Portugal.</p>
