<h2>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you were living in Portugal since before 1 January 2021.  You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Portuguese government and your local health authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/portugal">Portugal travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Portugal, read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/portugal/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell theâ€¯UKâ€¯government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you areâ€¯<a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/portugal/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Portugal</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to live in Portugal, you must meet all visa requirements before you travel.</p>

<p>Read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Portuguese governmentâ€™s <a rel="external" href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/entrada-em-portugal/" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Portugal</a>
</li>
  <li>more information about visas on the <a href="http://www.portugalemlondres.org/imigrar.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Portuguese Consulate in London page</a>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have rights under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should exchange your EU residence document (Registration Certificates issued by the town halls or Certificates of Permanent Residence issued by SEF) for a biometric residence permit. This permit will show that you have the rights defined in the Withdrawal Agreement. It also proves your right to enter Portugal, and exempts you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<p>For more information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/">the SEF Brexit portal</a> or phone the SEF Brexit helpline (+351 21 711 50 45)</li>
  <li>read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/" rel="external">SEF</a> guidance on residency rights for UK nationals</li>
  <li>read <a href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/faqs/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">SEFâ€™s frequently asked questions on residency</a>
</li>
  <li>visit the <a href="https://portaldiplomatico.mne.gov.pt/politica-externa/brexit" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs web page</a> (in Portuguese)</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021 and have an EU residence document</h3>

<p>To exchange your EU residence document for a biometric residence permit, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register on the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/">SEF Brexit portal</a>
</li>
  <li>download the certificate with the QR code. This is your official proof of residency in Portugal and is valid until your new biometric card is issued</li>
  <li>wait for SEF to send an appointment at a town hall designated for biometric data collection. SEF will contact you when they start sending appointments</li>
</ul>

<p>Your valid EU residence document will continue to be accepted until it expires, or until you receive your new biometric residence permit.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021 but do not have an EU residence document</h3>

<p>You can request a biometric residence permit by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:gricrp.cc@sef.pt">gricrp.cc@sef.pt</a>.</p>

<p>Your email must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a scanned copy or photo of the details page of your passport</li>
  <li>proof of your address</li>
  <li>proof you were living in Portugal before January 2021, for example rental agreements, utility bills, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you receive an email from SEF requesting additional documentation, you must respond within 10 working days. After the 10 days, you should still reply, sending the requested additional documentation.</p>

<p>When your request is approved, SEF will email a personalised digital token that will give you access to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/" rel="external">SEFâ€™s Brexit portal</a>. You must then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register on the portal</li>
  <li>download the certificate with the QR code. This is your official proof of residency in Portugal, valid until you receive your new biometric card</li>
  <li>wait for SEF to give you an appointment at a town hall for biometric data collection. SEF will contact you when they start sending appointments</li>
</ul>

<p>Portugal considers dual nationals to be in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement. If you are a dual citizen of the UK and an EU country, you should register your residency with your European nationality. You still have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Portugal at any time in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Read the Portuguese governmentâ€™s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/solicitar/residir/art98-1/" class="govuk-link">how to apply for residence as a family member</a>. Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-portugal#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Portugal.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Portugal</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/portugal/entry-requirements#passport-validity" class="govuk-link">Portugal travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Portugal using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Portugal with a Portuguese residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Portugal, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist" class="govuk-link">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your residence card or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021 but have not yet applied for a residence card, carry evidence that you are resident in Portugal. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are resident in Portugal, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If your passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-portugal">healthcare in Portugal</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study" class="govuk-link">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>

<p>If you are registered as a resident, you should register with the Portuguese national health service (SNS). You will have the same benefits as a Portuguese citizen.</p>

<p>When you are registered as a resident in Portugal, ask for a healthcare user number (NÃºmero de Utente de SaÃºde) at your local health centre (centro de saÃºde). You will need to show your residence certificate and your passport. Read the <a href="https://www.acss.min-saude.pt/category/citizens/international-health/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Portuguese government guidance on access to healthcare for residents</a>.</p>

<p>You can get private health insurance but you do not need to, and it is not a substitute for registering for state healthcare.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Portugal and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>are a frontier worker who lives in Portugal and commutes to work in the UK</li>
  <li>have been sent to Portugal temporarily by your UK employer</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-portugal-including-madeira%22%20/l%20%22s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on using an S1 form in Portugal</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Portugal, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC or GHIC to access healthcare in Portugal, unless you are a student or a detached (posted) worker. Current EHICs will remain valid until the expiry date on the card.</p>

<p>If you are living in Portugal, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC or GHIC if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Portugal</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p>The card you receive will depend on when you moved to Portugal.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start">Apply now for a new UK EHIC or GHIC</a>.</p>

<p>You should apply for a Portuguese-issued EHIC for visits outside of Portugal if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered with Portuguese Social Security (if you are working or the dependent of someone working in Portugal), or</li>
  <li>resident in Portugal and do not have healthcare cover from the UK or another EU country (ie, you are not entitled to an S1), but have a healthcare user number (NÃºmero de Utente de SaÃºde)</li>

<p>The UK has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/portugal-tax-treaties" class="govuk-link">double taxation agreement with Portugal</a> so that you do not pay tax on certain income in both countries.</p>
