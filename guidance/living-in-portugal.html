<h2>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you were living in Portugal since before 1 January 2021. These are indicated with sub-headings.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>You should follow the advice of the Portuguese Government and your local authority. You can also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/portugal" class="govuk-link">Portugal travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/portugal/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Portugal</a>.</p>

<p>Read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Portuguese governmentâ€™s <a rel="external" href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/entrada-em-portugal/" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Portugal)</a>
</li>
  <li>more information about visas on the <a href="http://www.portugalemlondres.org/imigrar.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Portuguese Consulate in London page</a>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you have lived in Portugal since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have rights under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should exchange your EU residence document (Registration Certificates issued by the town halls or Certificates of Permanent Residence issued by SEF) for a biometric residence permit. This permit will show that you have rights defined in the Withdrawal Agreement. It also proves your right to enter Portugal, and exempts you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021 and have an EU residence document</h3>

<p>You should apply to exchange your EU residence document for a biometric residence permit. You need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/">SEFâ€™s Brexit portal</a>
</li>
  <li>download the certificate with the QR code. This is your official proof of residency in Portugal and is valid until your new biometric card is issued</li>
  <li>wait for SEF to give you an appointment at a town hall designated for biometric data collection</li>
</ul>

<p>Your valid EU residence document should continue to be accepted until you receive your new biometric residence permit or until your EU residence document expires.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021 but do not have an EU residence document</h3>

<p>You can request a biometric residence permit by emailing <a href="mailto:brexit@sef.pt" class="govuk-link">brexit@sef.pt</a>.</p>

<p>Your email must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a scanned copy or photo of the details page of your passport</li>
  <li>proof of your address</li>
  <li>proof you were living in Portugal before January 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>If you receive an email from SEF requesting additional documentation, you must respond within 10 working days. If the 10 days have passed, you should still reply, sending the requested additional documentation.</p>

<p>When your request is approved, SEF will email a personalised digital token that will give you access to <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/" class="govuk-link">SEFâ€™s Brexit portal</a>. You must then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register on the portal</li>
  <li>download the certificate with the QR code. This is your official proof of residency in Portugal and is valid until your new biometric card is issued</li>
  <li>wait for SEF to give you an appointment at a town hall designated for biometric data collection</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021: family members joining you</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Portugal at any point in the future. Find more information on who this applies to on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe</a> page.</p>

<p>See the Portuguese governmentâ€™s guidance on <a href="https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/solicitar/residir/art98-1/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">how to apply for residence as a family member</a>. Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel.</p>

<p>For more information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://brexit.sef.pt/en/">SEFâ€™s Brexit portal</a> or phone SEFâ€™s Brexit helpline (+351 21 711 50 45)</li>

<h3>Additional support</h3>

<p>If you need additional support to complete your residence application, read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-support-fund-uknsf-applying-for-residency-in-eu-or-efta-countries" class="govuk-link">UK Nationals Support Fund</a>.</p>

<p>Support from the UK Nationals Support Fund will end on 26 November 2021. You should contact the UK Nationals Support Fund implementing partner before this date if you require additional support. If you are already being assisted by our implementing partner, they will continue to assist you until you have made your application.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport in Portugal</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/portugal/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">travel advice for Portugal</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/default/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU / European Free Trade Area (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Portugal using your EU / EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Portugal with a residence permit or long stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Portugal, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>You should carry your residence card, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your card, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence card, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Portugal. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Portugal, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped. This will not affect your rights in Portugal.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Portugal before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, especially within the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/default/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a>, you should carry with you your residence document or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, carry your certificate of registration.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Portugal, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is incorrectly stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you do not need any extra months on your passport to enter or exit EU countries.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/default/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>If you stay in Portugal with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> page for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-portugal">healthcare in Portugal</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances. Private health insurance is available but is not mandatory and should not be a substitute for registering for state healthcare.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="http://www.acss.min-saude.pt/category/citizens/international-health" class="govuk-link">Portuguese government guidance on access to healthcare for residents</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone who is registered as a resident can also register to access the Portuguese national health service (SNS) on the same basis as a Portuguese citizen.</p>

<p>You should ensure you are properly registered for healthcare as a resident in Portugal. Private health insurance is available but is not mandatory and should not be a substitute for registering for state healthcare.</p>

<p>Once you are registered as a resident in Portugal, register at your local health centre (centro de saÃºde) and get a healthcare user number (NÃºmero de Utente de SaÃºde) by showing your residence certificate and your passport.</p>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-portugal-including-madeira">guidance on how you can register for healthcare in Portugal and how the healthcare system works</a>. Make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Portugal and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>are a frontier worker who lives in Portugal and commutes to work in the UK</li>
  <li>have been sent to Portugal temporarily by your UK employer</li>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Portugal, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC or GHIC to access healthcare in Portugal, unless you are a student or a detached (posted) worker. Current EHICs will remain valid until the expiry date on the card.</p>

<p>If you are living in Portugal you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC or GHIC if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Portugal</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p>The card you receive will depend on when you moved to Portugal.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start">Apply now for a new UK EHIC or GHIC</a>.</p>

<p>You should apply for a Portuguese-issued EHIC for visits outside of Portugal if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered with Portuguese Social Security (if you are working or the dependent of someone working in Portugal), or</li>
  <li>resident in Portugal and do not have healthcare cover from the UK or another Member State (for example if you are not entitled to an S1), but have a healthcare user number (NÃºmero de Utente de SaÃºde)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Portuguese government has more <a href="https://www.seg-social.pt/pedido-cartao-europeu-seguro-doenca#" rel="external" class="govuk-link">information on how to apply</a>, including <a rel="external" href="https://www.seg-social.pt/documents/10152/21732/GIT_53_DGSS/b32f3c97-421a-41ba-8014-529b7d2c90f4/b32f3c97-421a-41ba-8014-529b7d2c90f4" class="govuk-link">an application form</a> which you should complete and hand in at your nearest Social Security office. Your Portuguese-issued EHIC will be sent to you by post.</p>

<p>An EHIC or GHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>
