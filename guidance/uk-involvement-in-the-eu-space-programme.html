<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Programme includes the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the European satellite navigation programmes, Galileo and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (<abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the Copernicus Earth Observation programme</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Surveillance and Tracking (<abbr title="EU Space Surveillance and Tracking">EUSST</abbr>) programme</li>
  <li>the Governmental Satellite Communications (GovSatCom) programme (a new <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> programme)</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK maintains access to <abbr title="EU Space Surveillance and Tracking">EUSST</abbr> services and is seeking full participation in the Copernicus component.</p>

<p>The UK’s membership of the European Space Agency (<abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr>) is not affected by leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as <abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr> is not an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organisation.</p>

<h2>Galileo and <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The UK no longer participates in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Galileo or <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr> programmes.</p>

<h3>Actions for businesses, academics and researchers</h3>

<p>Any UK businesses, academics and researchers currently contracted or expecting to carry out contracts on programmes in which the UK no longer participates should contact the relevant contracting authority to make sure that arrangements are in place to comply with the conditions of the contract and to avoid possible penalties.</p>

<p>Organisations in the UK and in UK Overseas Territories that currently hold ground infrastructure hosting contracts may wish to contact their contracting authority, such as the European Space Agency or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Global Navigation Satellite System Agency, to verify the future position.</p>

<p>Any UK users of the <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr> Safety of Life (SoL) service should make preparations for mitigating the loss of this service from 25 June 2021. UK users no longer have access to the <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr> Data Access Service (EDAS).</p>

<h3>Areas of UK involvement</h3>

<p>For the public and most UK, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and other satellite navigation users, there should be no noticeable impact. For example, devices such as smart phones can still use Galileo and <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>.</p>

<p>UK businesses and organisations are able to use the freely available ‘open’ signal to develop products and services for consumers, and can use the open position, navigation and timing services provided by Galileo and <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> subsidiaries of UK businesses are eligible to bid for future work on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Global Navigation Satellite System (<abbr title="EU Global Navigation Satellite System">GNSS</abbr>) programmes.</p>

<h3>Areas where UK involvement has come to an end</h3>

<p>The UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>does not use Galileo (including the future Public Regulated Service (<abbr title="Public Regulated Service">PRS</abbr>)) for defence or critical national infrastructure</li>
  <li>does not have access to the encrypted Galileo Public Regulated Service</li>
  <li>cannot play any part in the development of Galileo</li>
  <li>cannot play any part in the development of <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>from 25 June 2021 UK users will not be able to use the <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr> SoL service and the <abbr title="European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service">EGNOS</abbr> Working Agreements (EWAs), which will no longer be recognised by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This also means that UK-based businesses, academics and researchers cannot bid for future <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="EU Global Navigation Satellite System">GNSS</abbr> contracts and may face difficulty carrying out and completing existing contracts.</p>

<h2>Copernicus</h2>

<p>The UK welcomes the agreement in principle for the UK to continue to participate in the Copernicus component of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Programme as a third country for 2021-2027.</p>

<p>This agreement is subject to finalisation of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Regulation. The UK will need to assess any potential exclusions applied to third country participants in the Regulation against the agreement reached to ensure it receives a fair balance of rights in return for an appropriate financial contribution to the programme.</p>

<p>The UK reserves the right to reconsider participation following the finalisation of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Regulation. We expect the final confirmation on UK’s participation in the Copernicus component to be made in the first quarter of 2021.</p>

<h3>Actions for businesses, academics and researchers if the UK confirms its participation in the Copernicus component</h3>

<p>If the UK confirms in 2021 that we will participate in Copernicus, we expect UK-based businesses, academics and researchers will then be able to bid for future Copernicus contracts tendered through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, funded through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s Multi-annual Financial Framework and through any process using <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procurement rules.</p>

<p>Similarly, we expect UK users will also be able to access most of the Copernicus data and services as now. It is anticipated that UK would not have access to a small proportion of data considered to be security sensitive.</p>

<h3>Actions for businesses, academics and researchers if the UK is not able to reach an agreement with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> on Copernicus participation</h3>

<p>The UK reserves the right to reconsider its intention to participate in the Copernicus component if the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Regulation imposes conditions that impact the way the UK would participate. In such a case, the UK will not be able to participate in the parts of the Copernicus programme that are open only to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States. For example, UK-based businesses, academics and researchers will not be able to bid for future Copernicus contracts tendered through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, funded through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s Multi-annual Financial Framework or through any process using <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procurement rules after December 2020.</p>

<p>In this eventuality, we would encourage UK-based entities holding extant contracts to confirm arrangements with their relevant contracting authority.</p>

<p>Some UK users may lose the right to high-bandwidth access to the standard data from Copernicus Sentinels. Some UK users may also lose access to data sourced by Copernicus from Contributing Missions. UK users will not have access to data deemed security sensitive.</p>

<p>In this eventuality, UK-based Copernicus data users should consider the impact that losing access to any data or information not sourced under the free and open data policy may have on their operations.</p>

<h3>Areas where UK involvement continues under all circumstances</h3>

<p>The UK remains a member of the European Space Agency (<abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr>) and continues to participate in the Copernicus Space Component (CSC-4) of the Copernicus programme through <abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr>. This allows UK entities to continue to be able to bid for contracts tendered through <abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr> for CSC-4, its predecessor the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (<abbr title="Global Monitoring for Environment and Security">GMES</abbr>) programme, or under other programmes such as the Earth Observation Envelope Programme 5 (<abbr title="Earth Observation Envelope Programme 5">EOEP5</abbr>) and Future EO-1.</p>

<p>Copernicus has a free and open data policy which means that the data produced by its satellites (Sentinels) and the Land, Marine, Climate Change and Atmosphere services are freely available to UK users.</p>

<p>UK membership of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (<abbr title="European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites">EUMETSAT</abbr>), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (<abbr title="European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts">ECMWF</abbr>) and Mercator Ocean is unaffected, as these are European rather than <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> bodies. Those organisations retain access to high-bandwidth data that supports the Land, Marine, Climate Change and Atmosphere services.</p>

<p>UK organisations could previously bid for Copernicus contracts tendered through <abbr title="European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts">ECMWF</abbr> and Mercator Ocean. It is not yet clear whether this is still possible and will only become clear once the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has finalised agreements with their Entrusted Entities (including <abbr title="European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts">ECMWF</abbr> and Mercator Ocean).</p>

<p>Subsidiaries of UK organisations that are based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-based researchers using Copernicus data and services are unaffected from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The UK continues to be part of the Sentinel 6/Jason Continuity of Service (Jason-CS) mission. We expect that UK-based entities holding extant contracts in the Sentinel 6/Jason-CS mission will continue to be able to deliver that work. We encourage UK-based entities holding those contracts to confirm arrangements with their relevant contracting authority.</p>

<h2>Space surveillance and tracking</h2>

<p>The UK welcomes the agreement that UK users can continue to access <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Surveillance and Tracking services. This will help to manage the risk of collisions in space from space debris and satellites.</p>

<p>Whilst UK users can continue to receive services, the UK is no longer eligible to participate in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Surveillance and Tracking programme.</p>

<p>The UK continues to receive space surveillance and tracking data from the US.</p>

<h3>Actions for businesses, academics and researchers</h3>

<p>There should be no noticeable impact or disruption to space surveillance services for UK users already registered with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. New users from the UK need to apply in the same way as they did before. </p>

<h3>Areas where UK involvement has come to an end</h3>

<p>The UK does not participate in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Space Surveillance and Tracking programme, contribute to providing services to the programme or take part in the scientific and technical groups that make up the programme.</p>

<h2>UK involvement in the European Space Agency</h2>

<p>The UK’s membership of the European Space Agency (<abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr>) is not affected by leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as the <abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr> is not an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> organisation. Companies and other organisations should continue to apply for <abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr> programmes and contracts in the normal way.</p>

<p>UK entities that participate in <abbr title="European Space Agency">ESA</abbr> programmes should continue to follow the existing rules around exemptions from taxes and duties. These rules are set out in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1105/contents/made" rel="external" class="govuk-link">European Space Agency (Immunities and Privileges) Order 1978</a> (in particular articles 10 to 12). The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/diplomatic-privileges">HMRC guidance on diplomatic privileges</a> should be followed.</p>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>Businesses, academics and researchers with existing contracts relating to these programmes, or who use data and services, may contact the UK Space Agency at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@ukspaceagency.gov.uk">info@ukspaceagency.gov.uk</a> with any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Organisations who get Horizon 2020 research programme funding, or who are bidding for funding, can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-participation-in-horizon-2020-uk-government-overview">Horizon 2020 guidance</a>.</p>
