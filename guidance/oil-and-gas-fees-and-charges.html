<h2>Charging for environmental and other regulatory functions</h2>

<p>The Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (<abbr title="Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning">OPRED</abbr>) carries out environmental and other regulatory functions in relation to the offshore oil and gas industry, and the offshore gas and carbon dioxide storage industries.</p>

<p>The powers to charge fees are contained in a mixture of charging schemes made under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relevant legislation (e.g. the Offshore Chemical Regulations 2002 and the Offshore Petroleum Activities (Oil Pollution Prevention and Control) Regulations 2005);</li>
  <li>provisions in activity-specific legislation (e.g. for <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr>-related activities under the Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Production, Unloading and Storage (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2020); or</li>
  <li>provisions in fees-specific legislation (e.g. for Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (<abbr title="Oil Pollution Emergency Plans">OPEPs</abbr>) under the Pollution Prevention and Control (Fees) (Miscellaneous Amendments and Other Provisions) Regulations 2015).</li>
</ul>

<p>The main fees-specific legislation, the Pollution Prevention and Control (Fees) (Miscellaneous Amendments and Other Provisions) Regulations 2015 (the â€˜2015 Regulationsâ€™), have been amended several times, most recently in June 2022.</p>

<p>The time taken to undertake chargeable functions is recorded, and the fees are calculated by reference to 2 hourly rates â€“ one rate for the environmental specialist staff and one rate for the non-specialist staff. Environmental specialists are technical staff who carry out the relevant functions of the Secretary of State and non-specialists are administrative staff.</p>

<h2>The Pollution Prevention and Control (Fees) (Miscellaneous Amendments and Other Provisions) Regulations 2015</h2>

<p>The Pollution Prevention and Control (Fees) (Miscellaneous Amendments and Other Provisions) Regulations 2015 came into force on 22 July 2015, and introduced new fees for functions relating to:</p>

  <li>The Offshore Petroleum Activities (Conservation of Habitats) Regulations 2001</li>
  <li>Regulation 49 of the Offshore Marine Conservation (Natural Habitats etc.) Regulations 2007 (now replaced by Regulation 55 of the Conservation of Offshore Marine Habitats and Species Regulations 2017)</li>
