<p>The following legal obligations will apply to marketing authorisation holders (<abbr title="marketing authorisation holder">MAH</abbr>) in the UK, in a no deal scenario:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To operate a pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products.</li>
  <li>To have an appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance (<abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>) that resides and operates in the UK and is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products (“the UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>”).</li>
  <li>To maintain and make available upon request a pharmacovigilance system master file (<abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr>) that describes the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products (“the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr>”). The UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> must be located in, or accessible electronically from, the UK at the same site at which adverse reaction reports may be accessed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of this guidance is to provide practical information and instructions to UK <abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr> on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the role and responsibilities of the UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the development and registration of the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> and</li>

<h3 id="role-and-responsibilities-of-the-uk-qppv">Role and responsibilities of the UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The role and responsibilities of the UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> are equivalent to that of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>. In accordance with The Human Medicines Regulations (<abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr>) regulation 182(2) (as amended by The Human Medicines (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019 (“the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit Regulations”)), the holder must:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">(a) have permanently and continuously at its disposal an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessing-ordinary-residence-nationality-policy-guidance">appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance who is ordinarily resident</a>, and operates, in the United Kingdom and is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the pharmacovigilance system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, <abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr> Schedule 12A (inserted by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit Regulations) paragraph 10(4) states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The holder must ensure that the qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance has sufficient authority to influence the performance of the quality system and the pharmacovigilance activities of the holder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further guidance on the qualifications and role of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> is described in <a rel="external" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/post-authorisation/pharmacovigilance/good-pharmacovigilance-practices">Good Pharmacovigilance Practice (<abbr title="Good Pharmacovigilance Practice">GVP</abbr>) Module I – Pharmacovigilance systems and their quality systems</a>.</p>

<h3 id="temporary-exemption-as-to-the-location-of-the-uk-qppv">Temporary exemption as to the location of the UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>
</h3>

<p>There is a temporary exemption in place which allows you until 21 months after exit day to appoint a UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> that resides and operates in the UK. This is stated in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-guidance-note-on-the-regulation-of-medicines-medical-devices-and-clinical-trials-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/further-guidance-note-on-the-regulation-of-medicines-medical-devices-and-clinical-trials-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">section 1.9 of the further guidance from January 2019</a>.</p>

<p>This temporary exemption will allow the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> who, immediately before exit day, resided and operated in an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> state, to assume responsibility for UK authorised products until a <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> who resides and operates in the UK can be established.</p>

<h2 id="guidance-on-the-uk-psmf">Guidance on the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr>
</h2>

<h3 id="uk-psmf-location">UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> location</h3>

<p>You need to ensure that the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> is located at the same point in the UK from which the reports of suspected adverse reactions referred to in <abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr> regulation 187(4) are accessible (electronically or physically). This differs from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> concept where the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> shall be located either at the site where the main pharmacovigilance activities are performed or at the site where the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> operates.</p>

<p>The UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> needs to be permanently and immediately available for inspection at the stated location in the UK.</p>

<h3 id="uk-psmf-format-content-and-representation-of-pv-systems">UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> format, content and representation of <abbr title="pharmacovigilance">PV</abbr> systems</h3>

<p>The requirements for the format and content of the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> are equivalent to that of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr>. The minimum requirements for the content and maintenance of the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> are laid out in <abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr> Schedule 12A and further guidance on the format and content of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> is described in <abbr title="Good Pharmacovigilance Practice">GVP</abbr> Module II – Pharmacovigilance system master file.</p>

<p>The UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> must describe the global pharmacovigilance system and reflect the global availability of safety information for UK authorised products. The annex content should be specific to UK authorised products.
As per <abbr title="Good Pharmacovigilance Practice">GVP</abbr> Module II, there are different approaches to establishing a pharmacovigilance system. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr> can establish more than one pharmacovigilance system.</li>
  <li>A pharmacovigilance system can be shared by several <abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must make sure that every pharmacovigilance system covering UK authorised products is identified by a unique number.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-request-a-uk-psmf-number">How to request a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number</h3>

<p>All UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master files">PSMFs</abbr> must be registered with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. You should request a unique UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> for each pharmacovigilance system that you are operating for UK authorised products. Where the pharmacovigilance system is shared by several <abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr>, a single request for a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>A UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number request form will be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-licence-to-market-a-medicine-in-the-uk">available on the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> website</a> immediately after exit day in a no deal Brexit scenario.</p>

<p>You should not request a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number until you are planning to update the summary of pharmacovigilance system (<abbr title="Summary of pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr>) for your UK product licences (<abbr title="product license">PL</abbr>) via submission of a variation application.</p>

<p>You should follow the instructions for completing the form and submit to: <a href="mailto:UKPSMFadmin@mhra.gov.uk">UKPSMFadmin@mhra.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>You will receive a unique UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number by email within 10 working days.</p>

<p>All UK <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> must include a summary of the holder’s pharmacovigilance system, including the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number. You should submit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medicines-apply-for-a-variation-to-your-marketing-authorisation">Type IAIN variations</a> related to the <abbr title="Summary of pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and these submissions should cover all UK <abbr title="product license">PLs</abbr> under a unique pharmacovigilance system.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-make-your-submission">How to make your submission</h3>

<p>All applications to update the <abbr title="Summary of pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> are required to be submitted as a Type IAIN - C.I.8.a variation via the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-submissions-to-the-mhra-in-a-no-deal-scenario"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Submissions portal</a>.</p>

<p>In a no deal scenario we are expecting a large volume of regulatory submissions. You should submit your <abbr title="Summary of pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> updates as single changes and, to prevent delays, you should submit in collections of no more than 25 <abbr title="product license">PLs</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-you-need-to-supply">Documentation you need to supply</h3>

<p>You should supply the following documentation in a C.I.8.a submission (Introduction of, or changes to, a summary of pharmacovigilance system for medical products for human use):</p>

<h4 id="summary-of-the-pharmacovigilance-system-or-update-of-the-relevant-elements-as-applicable">1. Summary of the pharmacovigilance system, or update of the relevant elements (as applicable):</h4>
