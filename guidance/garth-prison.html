<p>There is a visitors car park outside the prison, including space for Blue Badge holders.</p>

<h3>Entering Garth</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will pass through a metal detector and be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Garth has a family-friendly dress code policy which means visitors should dress appropriately. You may be turned away if you are wearing items like vests, low-cut tops, high-cut skirts or dresses, shorts, see-through or ripped clothing, flip-flops or headwear other than that worn for religious reasons. Additionally, you cannot wear anything with offensive patterns or slogans, football shirts, cargo or combat trousers, uniforms (except school uniforms), hi-visibility clothing, steel toe-capped footwear or football boots. You will need to remove hats, scarves, sunglasses, gloves, large belt buckles, metal hair clips and excessive jewellery before you go in.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Garth. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker (you will need a £1 coin for this) in the visitors centre. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There is a visitors centre run by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.partnersofprisoners.co.uk/hmp-garth/" rel="external">Partners of Prisoners (POPS)</a>.</p>

<p>The centre is open on visiting days from 11:30am to 4:30pm.</p>

<p>Telephone: 01772 622 129<br>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/call-charges">Find out about call charges</a></p>

<p>The visiting hall is on the ground floor and wheelchair accessible. There is a children’s play area with activities organised by a play worker. Parents and guardians remain responsible for their children at all times.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days being run.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Garth</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Garth.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms and are able to make calls every day between 6am and 10pm.</p>

<p>Phones do not accept incoming calls so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Garth using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Garth.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Garth</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Prisoners can apply for permission to receive items from friends and family. The items can then be handed in at the visitors entrance before a visit between 1:05pm and 1:30pm.</p>

<p>There are limits to the number of parcels a prisoner can receive. Only specific items are allowed. Ask at the visitors centre for details.</p>

<p>Items are not normally accepted by post. However, a prisoner who is a foreign national or does not get visits can apply for permission for a family member or friend to send items in.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
