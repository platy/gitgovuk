<h2>Additional support this year</h2>

<p>A package of support has been put in place for students taking GCSE, AS and A level qualifications in summer 2022. It is intended to make sure that we are being as fair as possible to students given the disruption they have experienced, and many continue to face, due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Part of the changes includes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/ofquals-approach-to-grading-exams-and-assessments-in-summer-2022-and-autumn-2021">more generous grading this year</a> to provide a safety net for students who may have been impacted by the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Background to these changes</h2>

<p>Full details of the changes we have made to our rules can be found in the decisions for the consultations ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-the-assessment-of-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-2022">Proposed changes to the assessment of GCSEs, AS and A levels in 2022</a>’ and ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/arrangements-for-non-exam-assessment-for-qualifications-in-2022">Arrangements for non-exam assessment for qualifications in 2022</a>’.</p>

<h2>Vocational and technical qualifications</h2>

<p>Where needed, awarding organisations are allowed to make adaptations to assessments and qualifications due to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Schools and colleges have already been told what these changes will be, and you should speak to your school or college for further details about your specific qualification.</p>

<h2>Accessible version of diagram</h2>

<h3>Generous grading</h3>

<p>Exams will be graded more generously this year providing a safety net for students.</p>

<h3>Changes to coursework</h3>

<p>Non-exam assessment and fieldwork requirements adjusted, with flexibility in some subjects.</p>

<h3>Optional content</h3>

<p>There will be less content or fewer topics for students to learn in some GCSEs.</p>

<h3>Support materials</h3>

<p>Students will get formulae and equation sheets in some exams and won’t have to memorise as much.</p>

<h3>Advance information</h3>

<p>Exam boards will give information on the focus of exams for most subjects to help students revise.</p>
