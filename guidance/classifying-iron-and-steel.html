<h2>Spheroidal graphite cast iron</h2>

<p>Spheroidal graphite cast iron is classified as ‘Other cast articles of other iron’ under subheading 7325 99 90.</p>

<p>It’s not classified as non-malleable cast iron (under 7325 10 00) because it’s deformable under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tensile stress</li>
  <li>compressive stress (to a certain degree)</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not classified as malleable cast iron under 7325 99 10. Code 7325 99 10 60 covers spheroidal graphite cast iron (also known as ductile cast iron), and parts thereof, of a kind used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cover ground or sub-surfaces systems, or openings to ground or sub-surface systems</li>
  <li>give access to ground or sub-surface systems, or provide view to ground or sub-surface systems</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because it differs in terms of its composition and method of production.  Malleable cast iron under pressure or hammering can easily spread and flatten.</p>

<h2>Iron and steel processes and terms</h2>

<p>Forging is a process where metal is formed into a shape by heat and pressure.</p>

<p>Hot-drop forging and drop stamping is the production of metal shapes or sections by hot shaping cut blanks in dies.</p>

<p>Wire drawing is a cold process in which bars or rods (in irregularly wound coils) are drawn through one or more dies at high speed to obtain coiled wire of a smaller diameter.</p>

<p>Bright drawing is a cold process in which bars or rods are drawn at slow speed through one or more dies to obtain products of smaller or different shaped sections.</p>

<p>Hot drawing is a process where metal is heated and passed through a die to produce the finished shape.</p>

<p>Rolled or obtained by continuous casting means a process that casts molten steel directly into semi-finished shapes.</p>

<p>Hot extrusion is a process consisting of enclosing a piece of metal heated to forging temperature (approximately 360 to 520 degrees Celsius) in a chamber. High pressure is applied to the metal which is then forced through a die.</p>

<p>Cold extrusion is a similar process as hot extrusion, but with the metal kept at room temperature.</p>

<p>Sintering is a process where compacted metal powder (obtained by moulding) is passed under a burner and ignites. Air drawn through the powder causes any Sulphur or carbon present to oxidise. This causes a partial fusion of the particles in the powder, forming a porous cellular clinker (a sinter).</p>

<p>Closed-die forging is a process where hot metal is shaped within the walls of 2 dies that enclose the work piece.</p>

<p>Annealing is the heating of a metal or alloy to a predetermined temperature (below its melting point), maintaining the temperature before cooling slowly.</p>

<p>Pig iron, is an iron-carbon alloy not usefully malleable, containing more than 2% by weight of carbon and which may contain by weight one or more other elements within the following limits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not more than 10% of chromium</li>
  <li>not more than 6% of manganese</li>
  <li>not more than 3% of phosphorus</li>
  <li>not more than 8% of silicon</li>
  <li>a total of not more than 10% of other elements</li>
</ul>

<p>Spiegeleisen, is an iron-carbon alloy containing by weight more than 6% but not more than 30% of manganese and otherwise conforming to the specification of pig iron.</p>

<p>Ferro-alloys, are alloys in pigs, blocks, lumps or similar primary forms, in forms obtained by continuous casting and also in granular or powder forms, whether or not agglomerated, commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as de-oxidants, de-sulphurising agents or for similar uses in ferrous metallurgy and generally not usefully malleable, containing by weight 4% or more of the element iron and one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more than 10% of chromium</li>
  <li>more than 30% of manganese</li>
  <li>more than 3% of phosphorus</li>
  <li>more than 8% of silicon</li>
  <li>a total of more than 10% of other elements, excluding carbon, subject to a maximum content of 10% in the case of copper</li>
</ul>

<p>These may also contain by weight one or more other elements within the following limits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not more than 10% of chromium</li>
  <li>not more than 6% of manganese</li>
  <li>not more than 3% of phosphorus</li>
  <li>not more than 8% of silicon</li>
  <li>a total of not more than 10% of other elements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classes of Steel</h2>

<p>Steels can be grouped into one of the 3 classes of chemical composition. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stainless steels</li>
  <li>other alloy steels</li>
  <li>non-alloy steels</li>
</ul>

<p>Stainless steel is defined as an alloy steel containing, by weight, 1.2% or less of carbon and 10.5% or more of chromium (with or without other elements).</p>

<p>Other alloy steel is defined as steels not complying with the definition of stainless steel and containing by weight one or more of the following elements in the proportion shown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.3% or more of aluminium</li>
  <li>0.0008% or more of boron</li>
  <li>0.3% or more of chromium</li>
  <li>0.3% or more of cobalt</li>
  <li>0.4% or more of copper</li>
  <li>0.4% or more of lead</li>
  <li>1.65% or more of manganese</li>
  <li>0.08% or more of molybdenum</li>
  <li>0.3% or more of nickel</li>
  <li>0.06% or more of niobium</li>
  <li>0.6% or more of silicon</li>
  <li>0.05% or more of titanium</li>
  <li>0.3% or more of tungsten (wolfram)</li>
  <li>0.1% or more of vanadium</li>
  <li>0.05% or more of zirconium</li>
  <li>0.1% or more of other elements (except sulphur, phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen), taken separately</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of these criteria apply, then such steel is considered as a non-alloy steel.</p>

<p>If you’re importing goods into Northern Ireland from outside the UK and the EU, and the goods are at risk of onward movement to the EU, you should use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/sections" rel="external">Northern Ireland (EU) Tariff</a>.</p>

<p>If this guidance does cover your item, you’ll still need to look up the full commodity code to use in your declaration on the appropriate tariff.</p>

<p>You can find more ways to help you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports#split-consignments">find a commodity code</a> by referring to the links given in this section.</p>
