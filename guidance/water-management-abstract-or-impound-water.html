<h2>Water abstraction</h2>

<p>Taking water from a surface source (such as a river, stream or canal) or from an underground source is called abstraction. If you plan to take more than 20 cubic metres a day, you are likely to need an abstraction licence from the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency assesses applications to abstract (take) water against local water availability. How they do this is set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/water-abstraction-licensing-strategies-cams-process">abstraction licensing strategies (<abbr title="abstraction licensing strategies">ALS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h2>Before you apply for a water abstraction licence</h2>

<p>Before you apply for a new water abstraction licence or to change an existing licence, check your local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/water-abstraction-licensing-strategies-cams-process"><abbr title="abstraction licensing strategies">ALS</abbr></a> to find out how much water is available in your river catchment and if your application is likely to be successful.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/water-management-apply-for-a-water-abstraction-or-impoundment-licence#types-of-licence">Check you apply for the right type of licence</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/water-management-apply-for-a-water-abstraction-or-impoundment-licence#safe-passage-for-eels">Check whether you need to provide safe passage for eels</a>.</p>

<p>You can then <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/water-management-apply-for-a-water-abstraction-or-impoundment-licence">apply for a water abstraction licence</a>.</p>

<h2>Abstractions or impoundments that do not need a licence</h2>

<p>You do not need a licence or to register an exemption for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>abstractions of 20 cubic metres or less a day, provided your abstraction is part of a single operation - if you abstract from the same source at multiple points, the exemption only applies if the combined total of all abstractions is 20 cubic metres or less a day</li>
  <li>filling ships or boats with drinking or ballast water</li>
  <li>water used for fire fighting</li>
  <li>
    <p>abstraction (transfers) downstream of the normal tidal limit by navigation, harbour and conservancy authorities, other than in the hour before or after low tide</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>abstraction in connection with dredging operations authorised by an authority in its statutory duties in relation to waters upstream of the normal tidal limit and any abstraction downstream of the normal tidal limit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>abstraction of water within managed wetland systems (subject to the main abstraction into the system being licensed) and impounding works solely for the management, operation or maintenance of water within managed wetland systems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>abstraction of water with a high saline content from underground strata in the Cheshire basin (part of an existing exemption given to the former Mersey and Weaver River Authority in 1968)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>impounding works constructed by or on behalf of Internal Drainage Boards to exercise their functions within their appointed area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dewatering of underground strata and abstractions of surface waters to prevent interference with building or engineering works where the abstraction lasts less than 6 consecutive months, subject to restrictions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>low risk passive dewatering, if you follow the conditions in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/passive-dewatering-regulatory-position-statement">passive dewatering regulatory position statement</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>third-party operated dry docks that transfer water to and from a navigation authority’s water system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>impounding works when required in an emergency</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>emergency abstraction or impounding where undertaken by port, harbour or conservancy authorities, subject to notifying us using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-of-emergency-abstraction-form-wr341">form WR341</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>using rainwater collected from roofs and other surfaces - see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rainwater-harvesting-regulatory-position-statement">regulatory position statement on collecting rainwater</a> to find out when collected rainwater is exempt and when you need a water abstraction licence</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on restrictions see the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1044/contents/made" rel="external">Water Abstraction and Impounding (Exemptions) Regulations 2017</a>.</p>

<h2>Duration of abstraction licences</h2>

<p>Abstraction licences may have a time limit linked to a common end date. You can find this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/water-abstraction-licensing-strategies-cams-process"><abbr title="abstraction licensing strategies">ALS</abbr></a> for the area you are in.</p>

<p>When the Environment Agency grants a licence for the first time, it’s likely to be for between 6 and 18 years. When they renew a licence it will normally be for another 12 years.</p>

<p>They may also grant short duration licences where they think there may be issues with the licence or water availability in the longer term, or if you only need it for a short time.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, they will consider granting licences for up to 24 years.</p>

<h3>Long duration licence</h3>

<p>If you need to abstract water for a period of up to 24 years, when you apply you will have to demonstrate (through a business case) that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the lifetime of the infrastructure (for example, pumps, pipework, reservoirs) inseparably associated with the licence will extend over the desired duration of the licence</li>
  <li>you continuously need the service or product the infrastructure supplies throughout the duration of the licence</li>
  <li>you have assessed the likely environmental and economic changes that may affect the abstraction over the duration of the licence and the assessment shows no significant concerns (if an environmental impact assessment is required under planning law, this may suffice – alternatively you will need to provide an environmental assessment)</li>
  <li>the infrastructure contributes to sustainable development</li>
</ul>

<h2>Abstraction licence renewal</h2>

<p>If your current abstraction licence is due to expire, and you want to continue to abstract, you need to apply for a new licence at least 3 months before the existing licence expires.</p>

<h2>Trading water rights</h2>

<p>An abstraction licence gives its holder a right to abstract water. If you are unable to get your own abstraction licence, you may be able to enter into an agreement with an existing licence holder. You can agree for them to give you part or all of their abstraction right permanently or temporarily. This is called the trading of water rights.</p>

<p>If you already have an abstraction licence, you can agree to give the rights to some or all of that water to someone else. The trading of water rights will usually require the parties involved to apply to the Environment Agency for a new licence and to change or cancel (revoke) any existing licence.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make information available about abstractions, water availability and its approach to licensing</li>
  <li>advise before an application about whether proposed trading is likely to be licensed</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency is unable to act as a broker or negotiate the trading of licences.</p>

<h3>Types of trade</h3>

<p>There are 4 different trading scenarios. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whole, permanent – the whole of the trader’s abstraction right is transferred to the recipient on a permanent basis</li>
  <li>whole, temporary – the whole of the trader’s abstraction right is transferred to the recipient on a temporary basis</li>
  <li>part, permanent – part of the trader’s abstraction right is transferred to the recipient on a permanent basis</li>
  <li>part, temporary – part of the trader’s abstraction right is transferred to the recipient on a temporary basis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Find a trading partner</h3>

<p>You need to find your own trading partner.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">Contact the Environment Agency</a> to get abstraction licence details. They will give you information from the water resources public register, for free.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/water-abstraction-licensing-strategies-cams-process">abstraction licensing strategies (<abbr title="abstraction licensing strategies">ALS</abbr>)</a> give further information on any local constraints on water rights trades. For example, if trading water rights would damage the environment.</p>

<h2>Impounding water</h2>

<p>An impoundment is a structure within inland waters that can permanently or temporarily change the water level or flow. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dams</li>
  <li>weirs</li>
  <li>fish passes</li>
  <li>hydropower turbines</li>
  <li>sluices</li>
  <li>penstocks</li>
  <li>culverts</li>
  <li>lock gates</li>
  <li>retaining walls</li>
  <li>flumes</li>
  <li>reservoir embankments</li>
  <li>temporary diversions during construction work</li>
</ul>

<p>You must have an impounding licence before you start work on an impoundment structure, even in an emergency, unless one of the exemptions below applies.</p>

<h2>Impoundments that do not need a licence</h2>

<p>There are several exemptions where an impounding licence is not needed. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>works constructed without a licence before 1 April 2006, except where a notice is served by the Environment Agency requiring application for a licence</li>
  <li>where a public authority that manages or owns waterways or harbours constructs any new impoundment, alters an existing impoundment or obstructs or impedes the flow of inland waters while exercising its powers or undertaking its duties</li>
  <li>where the impoundment is authorised by a drought order or drought permit</li>
  <li>where the persons doing the works are Crown exempt</li>
  <li>where structures and works are authorised by legislation (for example an act of Parliament)</li>
  <li>where the Environment Agency serves notice requiring impoundment only for the purpose of screening or passage for eels</li>
</ul>

<h3>Low risk impoundment activities</h3>

<p>Some impoundment activities have little impact on the environment and other water users. The Environment Agency will not normally require an impounding licence application for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fish easements or passes that have formal written approval by the Environment Agency and do not significantly affect the distribution of flow over the weir</li>
  <li>placing a notch in a weir to encourage fish migration</li>
  <li>placing woody debris across part of the channel to diversify flows</li>
  <li>flap valves that only operate during flooding</li>
  <li>fixed control or passive flood prevention structures within the channel that only hold back flood water (structures with movable gates or sluices require an impounding licence)</li>
  <li>small measurement structures, such as v-notch or small rectangular weirs</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency will not normally require a licence application for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>refurbishing a sluice</li>
  <li>re-pointing (block work structures)</li>
  <li>repairs (for example to expansion joint, stone pitching or bank/wall)</li>
  <li>void filling (‘solid’ structures)</li>
  <li>managing vegetation</li>
  <li>de-silting</li>
  <li>re-positioning (rock, rubble or block work bank protection structures)</li>
  <li>replacing elements that do not contribute to phased replacement of the whole structure</li>
  <li>re-facing</li>
  <li>skimming/covering</li>
  <li>blockage removal, including screen clearing</li>
  <li>embankment grouting</li>
</ul>

<p>Other activities that will not normally require a licence are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>works that temporarily divert water during construction or maintenance of a structure and do not affect any other water users, rights or the environment</li>
  <li>impounding works or changes to the impoundment to reduce or avoid an immediate threat to human life, property or the environment during an emergency</li>
  <li>any activity outside the channel, for example on top of the river banks, such as installing or maintaining bridge supports or flood defences</li>
  <li>work in the river, parallel and adjacent to the bank that does not significantly narrow the channel, for example installing sheet piling, rip rap and rock revetments for erosion protection</li>
  <li>installing a wave wall on an existing reservoir dam that is not intended to impound any extra water</li>
  <li>increasing the height of spillway sidewalls (that does not alter the impounding level)</li>
  <li>altering, moving or constructing a spillway without increasing the impounded level or changing the downstream flow regime to the detriment of the environment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Low risk impoundment checklist</h3>

<p>If you answer ‘no’ to all of the following questions, then you are unlikely to need a licence. Use this checklist for your own records.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do surveys reveal any existing abstractions, including unlicensed ones, which may be affected by the proposal?</li>
  <li>Are there any other water users or riparian rights or interests that may be affected?</li>
  <li>Will the changes cause parts of the weir to suffer significantly reduced flows?</li>
  <li>Is the proposal within, or likely to have an impact on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Special Area of Conservation, Special Protected Area or Ramsar site?</li>
  <li>Are planned changes in river flow likely to cause significant change to invertebrate habitats?</li>
  <li>Does the proposal affect protected species (not fish) that may live at the site or elsewhere in the catchment?</li>
  <li>Are planned changes in the river flow likely to cause a significant change in the macrophyte and diatom communities?</li>
  <li>Will the proposal impact on either the up or downstream passage of fish (including eels)?</li>
  <li>Will the proposal impact on any fish spawning or nursery areas?</li>
  <li>Will the proposal cause sediment movement or deposition to be substantially altered above or below the site?</li>
  <li>Will pollutants be discharged or mobilised into the river during construction and/or operation?</li>
  <li>Is the proposal likely to significantly increase river turbidity or significantly alter movement of sediment?</li>
  <li>Does the scheme involve construction of a new raised reservoir with the capacity of 25,000 cubic metres or more?</li>
  <li>Will the proposal cause erosion of the river banks up or down stream?</li>
</ol>
