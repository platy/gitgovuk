<p>The easiest railway station to use is Doncaster. You can take a 20 minute taxi ride from there to the prison.</p>

</ul>

<p>There is a visitors car park.</p>

<h3>Entering Hatfield</h3>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Hatfield has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Hatfield. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. You can take in pushchairs and changing and feeding items for your baby.</p>

<p>Hatfield aims to provide an enjoyable visiting experience for families so expects you to be respectful and to supervise children at all times.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>Hatfield has a cafe in the visiting halls of both sites where you can buy hot and cold food and drinks.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>Family days are currently not available.</p>

<p>The days are made up of family activities, crafts and quizzes themed around seasonal events.</p>

<p>Library staff run the family days working in partnership with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reducing-reoffending.uk/" rel="external">Reducing Re-offending</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonadvice.org.uk/" rel="external">Prison Advice and Care Trust</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.novus.ac.uk/" rel="external">Novus</a> and other internal departments.</p>

<p>Men can apply for family days at the library.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Hatfield</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a resident during their time at Hatfield.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Residents do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this and can call anytime up to 10pm.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Hatfield using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the resident, depending on the rules at Hatfield.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Hatfield</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Clothing and gifts can not be sent in. Instead, clothing is exchanged during temporary release. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Hatfield</a> for information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

  <li>retail -  such as training as a barista or serving in the farm shop</li>
  <li>IT, corporate business, welding, barbering, catering, health and safety</li>

</li>
  <li>physical education - such as recreational PE programmes, navigation awards, basketball and first aid</li>
</ul>

<p>Residents can also take part in training, voluntary community work and paid employment with various local companies.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>
