<h2>Travel safely during the coronavirus outbreak</h2>

<p>Following this guidance will help you stay safe and protect others by controlling the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Every action to help reduce the spread will reduce any further resurgence of the virus in the coming months.</p>

<p>Even after you have received a vaccine, you should continue to follow this guidance on how to travel safely.</p>

<p>Before travelling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">how to stay safe and prevent the spread</a>
</li>
  <li>download the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</a> before you travel, if possible, and check in where you see official <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code posters</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">Find out more about what to do if you have COVID-19 or are experiencing symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>Find out whether you need to self-isolate and how you can protect others if you:</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Travel and COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19, even if they are mild, you should stay at home while you are waiting for a home self-sampling kit, a test site appointment or a test result. If you need to leave your home to get to a test site, limit your contact with other people and return home immediately afterwards. If possible, walk, cycle or drive in a private vehicle alone to the test site.</p>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>COVID-19 spreads through the air by droplets and aerosols that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person.</p>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Operators are free to set their own requirements for wearing face coverings and you should check with the operator of the service you are using before travelling.</p>

<p>When you choose to wear a face covering, it should fit tightly around the nose and mouth and contain multiple layers. Wearing the highest quality face covering available to you will provide greater protection.</p>

<p>When wearing a face covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering</li>
  <li>use a ‘black bag’ waste bin or litter bin to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste">dispose</a> of it – you should not put face coverings in a recycling bin or drop them as litter</li>
  <li>be mindful that a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound</li>
</ul>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by a police officer or other relevant person.</p>

<p>There may be rules for wearing face coverings in other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations. Check the guidance before travelling from England to the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

  <li><a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-frequently-asked-questions" class="govuk-link">face coverings in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Public transport</h2>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Operators are free to set their own requirements for wearing face coverings and you should check with the operator of the service you are using before travelling.</p>

<p>Before and during your journey, check with your transport operator for the latest travel advice on your route:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.traveline.info">bus, coach, tram and ferry operators</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/coronavirus.aspx" class="govuk-link">National Rail</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/coronavirus-covid-?intcmp=62419"><abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Help keep yourself, other passengers and transport staff safe by observing the following precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plan your journey and check your route to identify the options for reaching your destination</li>
  <li>travel at off-peak times</li>
  <li>use quieter stations and stops – get off a stop early if it’s less busy</li>
  <li>while waiting for a service to arrive stay outdoors, rather than indoors, where possible</li>
  <li>keep changes to a minimum, for example, between bus and train</li>
  <li>walk for more of your journey, for example, the first or last mile</li>
  <li>download the <a rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</a> before travelling</li>
  <li>make a <a href="#checklists-for-safer-travel" class="govuk-link">list of items to take with you</a>
</li>
  <li>open windows where it is possible and safe to do so</li>
  <li>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</li>
  <li>avoid touching your face</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when coughing or sneezing</li>
  <li>dispose of waste safely, including items such as used disposable face coverings</li>
  <li>respect other people and be considerate of them while travelling</li>
  <li>be aware of those who are pregnant, older or who have disabilities who may require a seat or extra space</li>
</ul>

<p>Treat transport staff with respect and follow instructions from your transport operator.</p>

<h3>Transport support services for people with disabilities</h3>

<p>All <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-disabled" class="govuk-link">transport support services for people with disabilities</a> are still available. You can contact providers in advance to understand the COVID-secure measures they have put in place to keep you safe on your journey. For more information, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rights-of-disabled-passengers-on-transport">check your rights as a passenger with a disability</a> before you travel.</p>

<h2>Taxis and private hire vehicles</h2>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Follow instructions from the operator and driver and treat them with respect.</p>

<h2>Aviation, ferries and maritime transport</h2>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement in England to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Operators are free to set their own conditions of carriage and you should check with the operator of the service you are using before travelling.</p>

<p>Before you travel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check with your travel operator and port, or airline and airport for the latest travel advice on your route and whether there are any specific requirements you need to know about</li>
  <li>download the <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</a>, if possible</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>Different rules apply in <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-advice" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-quarantine/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a> and <a href="https://gov.wales/foreign-travel-and-returning-home" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Wales</a>.</p>

<h2>Travelling within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the Common Travel Area</h2>

<h3>Travelling to England</h3>

<p>You can enter England from other parts of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. This is known as the Common Travel Area. However, there may be restrictions in place in the area you intend to travel from which prevent you from travelling. For example, if you are in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, there may be restrictions on movement which means you cannot travel to England.</p>

<p>You should check the restrictions in place where you intend to travel from before making arrangements to travel. If you do travel to England, you must follow the restrictions on what you can and cannot do until you arrive in England.</p>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>complete a passenger locator form</li>
  <li>take any COVID-19 tests</li>
  <li>quarantine on arrival in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not have been outside of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man in the 10 days before you arrive in England</p>

<h3>Travelling from England</h3>

<p>You may leave England to travel to other parts of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. However, there may be restrictions in place in the area you intend to travel to which prevent you from travelling. You may only be able to travel for certain reasons, such as work. You should check the restrictions in place at your intended destination, such as rules regarding the wearing of face coverings, before making arrangements to travel.</p>
