<h2>National lockdown</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">National lockdown</a> applies in England.</p>

<p>The rules are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations. You should check the rules that apply if you plan to travel to any other part of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-regulations-guidance-what-restrictions-mean-you">Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels">Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus">Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You must not leave your home unless you have a reasonable excuse (for example, for work or to attend a medical appointment). If you need to travel, you should stay local – meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live – and look to reduce the number of journeys you make overall. The list of reasons you can leave your home include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work, where you cannot reasonably work from home</li>
  <li>accessing education and for caring responsibilities</li>
  <li>visiting those in your support bubble – or your childcare bubble for childcare</li>
  <li>visiting hospital, <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your health</li>
  <li>buying goods or services that you need, but this should be within your local area wherever possible</li>
  <li>outdoor exercise – this should be done locally wherever possible, but you can travel a short distance within your area to do so if necessary (for example, to access an open space)</li>
  <li>attending the care and exercise of an animal, or veterinary services</li>
  <li>attending communal worship and life events, including weddings and funerals</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to travel, walk or cycle where possible, and plan ahead to avoid busy times and routes on public transport. This will allow you to practise social distancing while you travel.</p>

<p>Car sharing is not permitted with anyone from outside your household or support bubble unless your journey is undertaken for an exempt reason. See the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="#car-sharing">car sharing</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to use public transport, you should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="#public-transport">public transport</a> guidance.</p>

<p>You must not travel at all if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been told by the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/nhs-test-and-trace-if-youve-been-in-contact-with-a-person-who-has-coronavirus">NHS Test and Trace service to self-isolate</a>
</li>
  <li>are experiencing any <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms</a>
</li>
  <li>are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">self-isolating</a> as a result of COVID-19 symptoms or sharing a household or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubble</a> with somebody with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">symptoms</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staying away from home overnight</h3>

<p>You cannot leave your place of residence to go for holidays or overnight stays unless you have a reasonable excuse for doing so. This means that holidays in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and abroad are not allowed.</p>

<p>This includes staying in a second home or caravan, if that is not your primary residence. This also includes staying with anyone who you don’t live with unless they’re in your support bubble.</p>

<p>You are allowed to stay overnight away from your home if a legally permitted reason applies, including if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are visiting your support bubble</li>
  <li>are unable to return to your main residence</li>
  <li>need accommodation while moving house</li>
  <li>need accommodation to attend a funeral or related commemorative event</li>
  <li>require accommodation for work purposes or to provide voluntary services</li>
  <li>are a child requiring accommodation for school or care</li>
  <li>are homeless, seeking asylum, a vulnerable person seeking refuge, or if escaping harm (including domestic abuse)</li>
  <li>are an elite athlete or their support staff or parent, if the athlete is under 18, and it is necessary to be outside of the home for training or competition</li>
</ul>

<h2>Travel safely during the coronavirus outbreak</h2>

<p>It is against the law to leave your home to travel unless for work or other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#when-you-can-leave-home">legally permitted reasons</a>. If you need to travel you should stay local – meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live – and look to reduce the number of journeys you make overall.</p>

<p>You can help control COVID-19 and travel safely by walking and cycling, if you can. Where this is not possible, use public transport or drive.</p>

<p>You can also help control COVID-19 by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working from home where possible</li>
  <li>observing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social contact</a> rules</li>
  <li>keeping your distance when you travel, where possible</li>
  <li>washing or sanitising your hands regularly</li>
  <li>planning ahead and avoiding the busiest routes, as well as busy times like the rush hour</li>
  <li>downloading the <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID-19 app</a> before you travel, if possible, and checking in where you see official NHS COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code posters</li>
</ul>

<p>These restrictions apply to England only. The rules are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-regulations-guidance-what-restrictions-mean-you" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus">Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Social distancing</h2>

<p>You should stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre with extra precautions in place (such as wearing face coverings).</p>

<p>Help keep yourself, other passengers and transport staff safe by taking the following precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limit the number of people or households that you come into contact with, for example by avoiding the busiest routes, as well as busy times like the rush hour</li>
  <li>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</li>
  <li>avoid touching your face</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when coughing or sneezing</li>
  <li>travel side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow</li>
  <li>only touch surfaces where required for safe travel</li>
  <li>stay outdoors, rather than indoors, where possible</li>
  <li>minimise the time spent close to other people, where possible</li>
  <li>avoid loud talking, shouting or singing</li>
  <li>dispose of waste safely, including items such as used disposable face coverings</li>
</ul>

<p>You must wear a <a class="govuk-link" href="#face-coverings">face covering</a> on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs in England unless you are exempt.</p>

<h2>Social contact</h2>

<p>When travelling on public transport, aircraft, taxis, private hire vehicles, coaches, ferries or other maritime vessels, you must not gather with others outside of your household or support bubble.</p>

<p>There are some activities for which individuals are still permitted to travel in groups that do not otherwise conform to the requirements of the social contact rules. This is only where travel is reasonably necessary in order to carry out a specific activity, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with work, for example, transport organised by an employer during the course of your work</li>
  <li>providing support to a vulnerable person</li>
  <li>providing emergency assistance, and to avoid injury or illness or to escape risk of harm</li>
  <li>making arrangements where children do not live in the same household as both their parents or guardians</li>
  <li>training or competition, where the person concerned is an elite sportsperson</li>
  <li>where fulfilling a legal obligation such as attending court or jury service</li>
</ul>

<p>The police will be able to take action against those who break these rules, including asking people to disperse and issuing a fixed penalty notice of £200 for the first offence.</p>

<p>People aged 18 or over can be fined:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£200 for the first offence, lowered to £100 if paid within 14 days</li>
  <li>£400 for the second offence, then doubling for each further offence up to a maximum of £6,400</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules for social contact are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link" rel="external">social contact in Northern Ireland</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/covid-19-alert-levels">social contact in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>A face covering is a covering of any type which covers your nose and mouth. Surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) should continue to be reserved for people who need to wear them at work.</p>

<p>Face coverings are not a substitute for maintaining <a class="govuk-link" href="#social-distancing">social distancing</a> and good hand hygiene.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">How to wear and make a face covering</a>.</p>

<h3>Where you must wear face coverings</h3>

<p>It is the law that you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/592/contents" rel="external">must wear a face covering when travelling in England</a> on public transport. Such as, on or in a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bus or coach</li>
  <li>train or tram</li>
  <li>ferry or hovercraft or other vessel</li>
  <li>taxi or private hire vehicle</li>
  <li>aircraft</li>
  <li>cable car</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also wear a face covering in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs from which passenger services operate. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>airports</li>
  <li>rail stations and terminals</li>
  <li>the Channel Tunnel terminal in Kent</li>
  <li>ports and terminals</li>
  <li>bus, coach and tram stations and terminals</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also wear a face covering in other indoor settings.</p>

<p>If you do not wear a face covering in these settings you will be breaking the law and could be fined. The fine for a first offence is £200, or £100 if you pay the fine within 14 days.</p>

<p>Repeat offenders receiving fines either on public transport or in an indoor place will have their fines doubled on each subsequent offence up to a maximum value of £6,400. After the first offence, there will be no discount. As an example, receiving a second fine will amount to £400 and a third fine will be £800. A sixth fine and all subsequent fines will be £6,400.</p>

<p>These laws apply while you are in England. If travelling from any other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nation, you will be required to wear a face covering when you enter England, regardless of the rules in the nation you are transiting from.</p>

<h3>Other areas you should wear a face covering</h3>

<p>You must also wear a face covering by law in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">some other public places</a>, unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age or health, or if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#exemptioncards">a legitimate reason not to</a>.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to also wear a face covering in other enclosed spaces where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, or where there are people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>The rules for wearing face coverings are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/covid-19-coronavirus/covid-19-information-public#face-coverings" class="govuk-link" rel="external">face coverings in Northern Ireland</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-frequently-asked-questions">face coverings in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Face covering exemptions</h3>

<p>Some people <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">don’t have to wear a face covering</a> including for health, age or disability reasons.</p>

<p>Government and some operators have produced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#documents" class="govuk-link">cards and badges</a> which you can choose to wear to show you are exempt. There is no requirement to do this though, and if you rely on an exemption, transport staff should not ordinarily ask for evidence.</p>

<p>Some transport staff may also not wear a face covering if it is not required for their job.</p>

<h3>When you can remove your face covering</h3>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by a police officer or other relevant person.</p>

<p>You do not need to wear a face covering if you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#legitimate-reasons-not-to-wear-a-face-covering">legitimate reason not to</a>.</p>

<p>Within the public area of a transport hub, passengers are able to remove their face covering in order to eat and drink when seated. They must put their face covering back on once they finish eating or drinking.</p>

<p>It is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering. For longer journeys, take more than one face covering and a plastic bag for used face coverings.</p>

<p>Please be mindful that the wearing of a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

<h3>Disposing of used face coverings</h3>

<p>Use a ‘black bag’ waste bin or litter bin to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste">dispose</a> of face coverings. You should not put face coverings in a recycling bin or drop them as litter.</p>

<h2>Walking and cycling</h2>

<p>It is against the law to leave your home to travel unless for work or other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#when-you-can-leave-home" class="govuk-link">legally permitted reasons</a>.</p>

<p>Where you need to travel, walk or <a href="https://www.think.gov.uk/cycle-safety" class="govuk-link" rel="external">cycle</a> if you can. This will reduce pressure on public transport and the road network.</p>

<p>You should stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre with extra precautions in place (such as wearing face coverings).</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">local council</a> can help you plan your journey by providing maps showing dedicated paths and routes.</p>

<p>You must observe <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">social contact</a> rules while walking or cycling in England.</p>

<p>Where possible, <a class="govuk-link" href="#social-distancing">keep a suitable distance from other people</a>. For example, when waiting at crossings and traffic lights. Take precautions where this is not possible.</p>

<p>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands before and after cycling.</p>

<p>Consider making a <a href="#checklists-for-safer-travel" class="govuk-link">list of items to take with you</a>.</p>

<h2>Private cars and other vehicles</h2>

<h3>Plan your journey</h3>

<p>It is against the law to leave your home to travel unless for work or other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#when-you-can-leave-home" class="govuk-link">legally permitted reasons</a>.</p>

<p>You may rent a car or other vehicle for travel where the vehicle is being used for the above reasons.</p>

<p>Plan your route, including any breaks, before setting out.</p>

<p>Download the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS COVID-19 app</a>, if possible.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.think.gov.uk/campaign/vehicle-safety-checks">Check that your vehicle is safe and roadworthy</a> if you haven’t used it for several weeks.</p>

<p>People from a household or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubble</a> can travel together in a vehicle.</p>

<p>You should wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isn’t possible and where you will come into contact with people outside your household or support bubble. Take care to <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">use face coverings properly</a>.</p>

<p>Consider making a <a class="govuk-link" href="#checklists-for-safer-travel">list of items to take with you</a>.</p>

<h3>Car sharing</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home">National lockdown</a> applies in England.</p>

<p>There are also guidelines for travelling in <a href="#taxis-and-private-hire-vehicles" class="govuk-link">taxis and private hire vehicles</a>.</p>

<p>It is against the law to leave your home to travel unless for work or other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#when-you-can-leave-home" class="govuk-link">legally permitted reasons</a>.</p>

<p>Car sharing is not permitted with someone from outside your household or your support bubble unless your journey is undertaken for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#when-you-can-leave-home">exempt reason</a>. For example, if car sharing is reasonably necessary as part of your work.</p>

<p>It is difficult to socially distance during car journeys. Where it is essential to car share, you can reduce the risk of transmission by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sharing the transport with the same people each time</li>
  <li>minimising the group size at any one time</li>
  <li>opening windows for ventilation</li>
  <li>travelling side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow</li>
  <li>facing away from each other</li>
  <li>considering seating arrangements to maximise distance between people in the vehicle</li>
  <li>cleaning your car between journeys using standard cleaning products – make sure you clean door handles and other areas that people may touch</li>
  <li>asking the driver and passengers to <a class="govuk-link" href="#face-coverings">wear a face covering</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>On your journey</h3>

<p>Expect more pedestrians and cyclists, especially at peak times of day. Where possible, allow other road users to <a class="govuk-link" href="#social-distancing">maintain social distancing</a>. For example, give cyclists space at traffic lights.</p>

<p>At garages, petrol stations and motorway services, try to keep your distance from other people and, if possible, pay by contactless. Follow guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">use of face coverings</a>. Where possible, check in using the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/">NHS COVID-19 app</a> if you enter a venue that has an official NHS COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code poster at the entrance. Alternatively, you can provide your contact details.</p>

<p>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands often, and always when exiting or re-entering your vehicle.</p>

<h3>Completing your journey</h3>

<p>When finishing your journey, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Public transport</h2>

<p>You can continue using the public transport network if you need to travel for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#when-you-can-leave-home">exempt reason</a>.</p>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs in England. You will be breaking the law if you fail to do so and could be fined.</p>

<p>Some people <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">don’t have to wear a face covering</a> for health, age or disability reasons.</p>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by a police officer or other relevant person.</p>

<p>It is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering.</p>

<p>If you need to dispose of your face covering, use ‘black bag’ waste bins or litter bins. You should not use a recycling bin.</p>

<h3>Plan your journey</h3>

<p>Before and during your journey, check with your transport operator for the latest travel advice on your route:</p>

<p>Travel may take longer than normal on some routes due to social distancing measures. Allow more time if your journey involves changes between different forms of transport.</p>

<p>If you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travel at off-peak times</li>
  <li>use quieter stations and stops – get off a stop early if it’s less busy</li>
  <li>keep changes to a minimum, for example, between bus and train</li>
  <li>walk for more of your journey, for example, the first or last mile</li>
  <li>book your tickets online in advance or pay by contactless</li>

<p>If you need help, try to <a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">keep a suitable distance from members of staff</a>.  If this isn’t possible, try to avoid physical contact and keep the time you spend near staff as short as possible.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Where travel is necessary, consider whether children could walk or cycle, accompanied by a responsible adult or carer, where appropriate.</p>

<p>Children in England must also observe <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">social contact</a> rules in some cases.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#social-distancing">Social distancing applies to children</a> as well as adults. Children should keep their distance from people who are not in their household or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubble</a> while on public transport and in enclosed or substantially enclosed public areas of transport hubs.</p>

<p>If this isn’t possible, children should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid physical contact</li>
  <li>face away from others</li>
  <li>keep the time spent near others as short as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Children under the age of 3 should not wear face coverings. Children aged from 3 to 10 can wear face coverings, but they are not required to.</p>

<p>If you are the responsible adult or carer travelling with children, please help them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minimise the surfaces they touch</li>

</ul>

<h2>Taxis and private hire vehicles</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home">National lockdown</a> applies in England.</p>

<p>It is against the law to leave your home to travel unless for work or other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#when-you-can-leave-home" class="govuk-link">legally permitted reasons</a>.</p>

<p>If you are leaving your home to travel for a legally permitted reason, you must also note that, aside from the driver, it is not permitted to share a taxi or private hire vehicle with someone from outside your household or your support bubble unless doing so is itself necessary for an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#meeting-other-people" class="govuk-link">exempt reason</a>, for example, if it is reasonably necessary as part of your work.</p>

<p>You must wear a <a class="govuk-link" href="#face-coverings">face covering</a> when using taxis or private hire vehicles. You will be breaking the law if you fail to do so and could be fined. A taxi driver or private hire vehicle operator will be entitled to refuse to accept you if you do not wear a face covering, unless you are exempt from this requirement.</p>

<p>You should stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre with extra precautions in place (such as wearing face coverings).</p>

<p>Follow the advice of the operator and driver. For example, you may be asked to sit in the back left-hand seat if travelling alone. You may want to check with your taxi or private hire operator before travelling if they have put any additional measures in place.</p>

<h2>Travelling abroad</h2>

<p>You can only travel internationally – or within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> – where you have a legally permitted reason to leave home. In addition, you should consider the public health advice in the country you are visiting.</p>

<p>If you do need to travel overseas (and are legally permitted to do so, for example, because it is for work), even if you are returning to a place you’ve visited before, you should look at the rules in place at your destination and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>) travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>Foreign nationals are subject to the ‘Stay at Home’ regulations. You should not travel abroad unless it is permitted. This means you must not go on holiday.</p>

<p>If you are visiting the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, you may return home. You should check whether there are any restrictions in place at your destination.</p>

<h3>Entry restrictions</h3>

<p>There are restrictions in place on travel to some countries and what you can do when you are there. For example, you may need proof of a negative COVID-19 test to travel to some countries.</p>

<p>Before you travel, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">government travel advice for the latest information on COVID-19 entry requirements and travel warnings</a> for the country you are travelling to</li>
  <li>make sure you understand the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control" class="govuk-link">restrictions on re-entering the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Also read the following guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus">guidance for British citizens travelling abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-air-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">guidance for passengers in airports and on aircraft</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Check your specific plans with your airline, ferry, train operator and accommodation provider. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance" class="govuk-link">get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover</a>.</p>

<p>Your transport provider may put measures in place to help you follow the public health guidance of the destination country.</p>

<h2>Exemptions – people who do not have to wear a face covering on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs</h2>

<p>The requirement to wear a face covering does not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a child under the age of 11</li>
  <li>passengers in an allocated cabin, berth or other similar accommodation, when they are alone or with members of their household or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubble</a>
</li>
  <li>passengers who remain in their private vehicle while on board public transport, for example on a car ferry</li>
  <li>a person who enters or is within a transport hub in a vehicle (other than a vehicle being used for the provision of a public transport service)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Legitimate reasons not to wear a face covering</h3>

<p>You also do not need to wear a face covering if you have a legitimate reason not to. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you have a physical or mental illness or impairment, or a disability that means you cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering</li>
  <li>if putting on, wearing or removing a face covering would cause you severe distress</li>
  <li>if you are travelling with, or providing help to, someone who relies on lip reading to communicate</li>
  <li>if you are travelling to avoid injury or escape the risk of harm, and you do not have a face covering with you</li>
  <li>if you need to remove it during your journey to avoid harm or injury or the risk of harm or injury to yourself or others</li>
  <li>if you need to eat, drink, or take medication on public transport</li>
  <li>if you are asked to remove your face covering by a police officer or other official, for example to check your railcard</li>
  <li>in other situations set out in further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-face-covering">government face covering guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enforcement of face coverings on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs</h3>

<p>You are not allowed to get on public transport or enter substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs if you are not wearing a face covering, unless you have an <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">exemption or a legitimate reason for not wearing one</a>. Transport staff may tell you not to board or ask you to get off.</p>

<p>If you refuse to wear a face covering, you can receive a fine from the police or Transport for London enforcement officers. The fixed penalty notice will require you to pay £200, which is reduced to £100 if paid within 14 days.</p>

<p>Repeat offenders receiving fines either on public transport or in an indoor place will have their fines doubled on each subsequent offence up to a maximum value of £6,400. After the first offence, there will be no discount. As an example, receiving a second fine will amount to £400 and a third fine will be £800. A sixth fine and all subsequent fines will be £6,400.</p>
