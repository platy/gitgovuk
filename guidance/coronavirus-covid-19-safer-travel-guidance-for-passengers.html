<h2>Travel safely during the coronavirus outbreak</h2>

<p>You should work from home if you can. If you’re going to travel, plan ahead and travel safely. This means you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">rules on what you can and cannot do</a>
</li>
  <li>check your route before you leave</li>
  <li>walk or cycle if possible</li>
  <li>follow the guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#public-transport" class="govuk-link">safe use of public transport</a>
</li>
  <li>follow the guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#private-cars-and-other-vehicles" class="govuk-link">safe use of private cars and other vehicles</a> – where possible only car share with members of your own household or support bubble</li>
  <li>download the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS COVID-19 app</a> before you travel, if possible, and check in where you see official NHS COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code posters</li>
</ul>

<p>Help keep yourself, other passengers and transport staff safe by taking the following precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain social distancing</li>
  <li>limit the number of people or households that you come into contact with, for example, by avoiding the busiest routes, as well as busy times, such as the rush hour</li>
  <li>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</li>
  <li>avoid touching your face</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when coughing or sneezing</li>
  <li>travel side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow</li>
  <li>only touch surfaces where required for safe travel</li>
  <li>stay outdoors, rather than indoors, where possible</li>
  <li>minimise the time spent close to other people, where possible</li>
  <li>avoid loud talking, shouting or singing</li>
  <li>dispose of waste safely, including items such as used disposable face coverings</li>
</ul>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs in England, unless you are exempt.</p>

<p>You should follow this guidance even if you have been vaccinated, as you could still spread COVID-19 to others. Check the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-what-to-expect-after-vaccination/what-to-expect-after-your-covid-19-vaccination" class="govuk-link">what to expect after your vaccination</a>.</p>

<p>You must not travel at all if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been told by the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/nhs-test-and-trace-if-youve-been-in-contact-with-a-person-who-has-coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS Test and Trace service to self-isolate</a>
</li>
  <li>are experiencing any <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/">coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms</a>
</li>
  <li>are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">self-isolating</a> as a result of COVID-19 symptoms or sharing a household or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">support bubble</a> with somebody with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">symptoms</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance applies to England only. See:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Travel and coronavirus testing</h2>

<p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus, you must stay at home while you are waiting for a home self-sampling kit, a test site appointment or a test result. If you need to leave your home to get to a test site, observe strict social distancing advice and return home immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>You may be asked to take a coronavirus test by your employer, at school or at university, even if you are not displaying coronavirus symptoms. If you know you are going to be tested, before you leave home consider how you will travel back home in a way that protects others should you test positive.</p>

<p>If possible, walk, cycle or drive in a private vehicle alone to the test site.</p>

<p>If driving, you should travel by yourself or, if necessary, only with people from your household or support bubble. Follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#private-cars-and-other-vehicles" class="govuk-link">guidance on car-sharing</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to use public transport to travel to the test site, you should travel alone or, if necessary, only with people from your household or support bubble. Try to avoid travelling on busy routes or during busy periods, such as rush hour. Follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#public-transport">guidance to keep yourself, other passengers and public transport staff safe</a>.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about travelling back from the testing venue safely should you test positive, discuss this in advance with your employer and arrange to attend a community test centre near your home, or arrange a home test if available. If you are an essential worker, you can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested#employer-referral" class="govuk-link">self-referral portal for testing essential workers</a>.</p>

<p>If students have concerns about travel arrangements should they test positive, they should discuss this with their college or university.</p>

<h2>Social distancing</h2>

<p>Guidance on meeting friends and family was updated for Step 3 to apply from 17 May. Close contact with friends and family is a personal choice, but you should consider the guidance on risks associated with COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#keeping-yourself-and-others-safe" class="govuk-link">actions you can take to help keep yourself and others safe safe</a>.</p>

<p>Social distancing requirements continue to apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the workplace</li>
  <li>in businesses</li>
  <li>at public venues</li>
  <li>on public transport</li>
</ul>

<p>When travelling you should, where possible, stay 2 metres apart or 1 metre apart with mitigations, from people who are not part of your household or support bubble.</p>

<p>Read guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19#keep-a-safe-distance-social-distancing">how to stop the spread of coronavirus by keeping a safe distance</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Meeting and travelling with other people</h2>

<p>On all public transport you must travel in groups of no more than 6, or 2 households, unless you are travelling for a reason that is exempt.</p>

<p>You can travel in a group larger than 6 people or 2 households where travel is reasonably necessary to carry out a specific activity. For example, with work, if your employer has organised transport during the course of your work.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">guidance on what you can and cannot do</a> for more information about when you can meet in larger groups.</p>

<p>The police will be able to take action against those who break these rules, including asking people to disperse and issuing a fixed penalty notice of £200 for the first offence.</p>

<p>People aged 18 or over can be fined:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£200 for the first offence, lowered to £100 if paid within 14 days</li>
  <li>£400 for the second offence, then doubling for each further offence up to a maximum of £6,400</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules for how many people can meet indoors and outdoors are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19" rel="external">the rules in Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels/">the rules in Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/covid-19-alert-levels" rel="external">the rules in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>A face covering is a covering of any type that covers your nose and mouth. Surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) should be reserved for people who need to wear them at work.</p>

<p>Face coverings are not a substitute for maintaining <a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing</a> and good hand hygiene.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">How to wear and make a face covering</a>.</p>

<h3>Where you must wear face coverings</h3>

<p>It is the law that you <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/592/contents" class="govuk-link">must wear a face covering when travelling in England</a> on public transport. Such as, on or in a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bus or coach</li>
  <li>train or tram</li>
  <li>ferry or hovercraft or other vessel</li>
  <li>taxi or private hire vehicle</li>
  <li>aircraft</li>
  <li>cable car</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also wear a face covering in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs from which passenger services operate. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>airports</li>
  <li>rail stations and terminals</li>
  <li>the Channel Tunnel terminal in Kent</li>
  <li>ports and terminals</li>
  <li>bus, coach and tram stations and terminals</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also wear a face covering in other indoor settings.</p>

<p>If you do not wear a face covering in these settings you will be breaking the law and could be fined. The fine for a first offence is £200, or £100 if you pay the fine within 14 days.</p>

<p>Repeat offenders receiving fines either on public transport or in an indoor place will have their fines doubled on each subsequent offence up to a maximum value of £6,400. After the first offence, there will be no discount. As an example, receiving a second fine will amount to £400 and a third fine will be £800. A sixth fine and all subsequent fines will be £6,400.</p>

<p>These laws apply while you are in England. If travelling from any other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nation, you will be required to wear a face covering when you enter England, regardless of the rules in the nation you are transiting from.</p>

<h3>Other areas you should wear a face covering</h3>

<p>You must also wear a face covering by law in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-to-wear-a-face-covering">some other public places</a>, unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age or health, or if you have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#exemptioncards" class="govuk-link">a legitimate reason not to</a>.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to also wear a face covering in other enclosed spaces where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, or where there are people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>The rules for wearing face coverings are different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Face covering exemptions</h3>

<p>Some people <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">don’t have to wear a face covering</a> including for health, age or disability reasons.</p>

<p>Government and some operators have produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#documents">cards and badges</a> which you can choose to wear to show you are exempt. There is no requirement to do this, though, and if you rely on an exemption, transport staff should not ordinarily ask for evidence.</p>

<p>Some transport staff may also not wear a face covering if it is not required for their job.</p>

<h3>When you can remove your face covering</h3>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by a police officer or other relevant person.</p>

<p>You do not need to wear a face covering if you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#legitimate-reasons-not-to-wear-a-face-covering">legitimate reason not to</a>.</p>

<p>Within the public area of a transport hub, passengers are able to remove their face covering in order to eat and drink when seated. They must put their face covering back on once they finish eating or drinking.</p>

<p>It is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#how-to-wear-a-face-covering">Follow the guidance on how to wear and remove a face covering</a>.</p>

<p>Please be mindful that the wearing of a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

<h3>Disposing of used face coverings</h3>

<p>Use a ‘black bag’ waste bin or litter bin to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste" class="govuk-link">dispose</a> of face coverings. You should not put face coverings in a recycling bin or drop them as litter.</p>

<h2>Walking and cycling</h2>

<p>When travelling, walk or <a href="https://www.think.gov.uk/cycle-safety" class="govuk-link" rel="external">cycle</a> if you can.</p>

<p>You should stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre while wearing a face covering.</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">local council</a> can help you plan your journey by providing maps showing dedicated paths and routes.</p>

<p>You must observe <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing</a> rules while walking or cycling in England.</p>

<p>Where possible, <a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">keep a suitable distance from other people</a>. For example, when waiting at crossings and traffic lights. Take precautions where this is not possible.</p>

<p>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands before and after cycling.</p>

<p>Consider making a <a class="govuk-link" href="#checklists-for-safer-travel">list of items to take with you</a>.</p>

<h2>Private cars and other vehicles</h2>

<h3>Plan your journey</h3>

<p>Plan your route, including any breaks, before setting out.</p>

<p>Download the <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS COVID-19 app</a>, if possible.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.think.gov.uk/campaign/vehicle-safety-checks" class="govuk-link">Check that your vehicle is safe and roadworthy</a> if you haven’t used it for several weeks.</p>

<p>You should wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isn’t possible and where you will come into contact with people outside your household or support bubble. Take care to <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">use face coverings properly</a>.</p>

<p>Consider making a <a href="#checklists-for-safer-travel" class="govuk-link">list of items to take with you</a>.</p>

<h3>Car sharing</h3>

<p>There are guidelines for travelling in <a href="#taxis-and-private-hire-vehicles" class="govuk-link">taxis and private hire vehicles</a>.</p>

<p>When car sharing, you should only travel in groups of no more than 6 people, or 2 households, unless you are travelling for a reason that is exempt.</p>

<p>You can protect yourself and those you are sharing a car with by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sharing the car with the same people each time and, where possible, only with members of your household or support bubble</li>
  <li>minimising the group size at any one time</li>
  <li>opening windows for ventilation</li>
  <li>travelling side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow</li>
  <li>facing away from each other</li>
  <li>considering seating arrangements to maximise distance between people in the vehicle</li>
  <li>cleaning your car between journeys using standard cleaning products – make sure you clean door handles and other areas that people may touch</li>
  <li>asking the driver and passengers to <a class="govuk-link" href="#face-coverings">wear a face covering</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>On your journey</h3>

<p>Expect more pedestrians and cyclists, especially at peak times of day. Where possible, allow other road users to <a class="govuk-link" href="#social-distancing">maintain social distancing</a>. For example, give cyclists space at traffic lights.</p>

<p>At garages, petrol stations and motorway services, try to keep your distance from other people and, if possible, pay by contactless. Follow guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">use of face coverings</a>. Where possible, check in using the <a rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID-19 app</a> if you enter a venue that has an official NHS COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code poster at the entrance. Alternatively, you can provide your contact details.</p>

<p>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands often, and always when exiting or re-entering your vehicle.</p>

<h3>Completing your journey</h3>

<p>When finishing your journey, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Public transport</h2>

<p>You can use public transport if you need to travel.</p>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs in England. You will be breaking the law if you fail to do so and could be fined.</p>

<p>Some people <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">don’t have to wear a face covering</a> for health, age or disability reasons.</p>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by a police officer or other relevant person.</p>

<p>It is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering.</p>

<p>If you need to dispose of your face covering, use ‘black bag’ waste bins or litter bins. You should not use a recycling bin.</p>

<h3>Plan your journey</h3>

<p>Before and during your journey, check with your transport operator for the latest travel advice on your route:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.traveline.info" rel="external" class="govuk-link">bus, coach, tram and ferry operators</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/coronavirus-covid-?intcmp=62419" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Travel may take longer than normal on some routes due to social distancing measures. Allow more time if your journey involves changes between different forms of transport.</p>

<p>If you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travel at off-peak times</li>
  <li>use quieter stations and stops – get off a stop early if it’s less busy</li>
  <li>keep changes to a minimum, for example, between bus and train</li>
  <li>walk for more of your journey, for example, the first or last mile</li>
  <li>book your tickets online in advance or pay by contactless</li>
  <li>download the <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS COVID-19 app</a> before travelling</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider making a <a href="#checklists-for-safer-travel" class="govuk-link">list of items to take with you</a> and minimise the luggage you take.</p>

<h3>On your journey</h3>

<p>Even after you have received a vaccine, you should continue to apply safety measures when using public transport.</p>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs in England. You will be breaking the law if you fail to do so and could be fined.</p>

<p>Some people <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">don’t have to wear a face covering</a> for health, age or disability reasons.</p>

<p>When travelling you should, where possible, stay 2 metres apart or 1 metre apart with mitigations, from people who are not part of your household or support bubble. Travel is permitted in groups of no more than 6 people, or 2 households, unless you are travelling for a reason that is exempt.</p>

<p>Help keep yourself, other passengers and transport staff safe by observing the following precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure you maintain <a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing</a>, where possible, including at busy entrances, exits, under canopies, bus stops, platforms or outside of stations</li>
  <li>limit the number of people that you come into contact with, for example, avoid travelling during peak hours</li>

  <li>avoid consuming food and drink on public transport, where possible</li>
  <li>respect other people’s space while travelling</li>
  <li>be aware of pregnant, older and disabled people who may require a seat or extra space</li>
  <li>be aware that not all disability is visible and <a class="govuk-link" href="#exemptions-face-coverings">some people may be exempt from wearing a face covering</a>
</li>
  <li>where possible, check in using the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/">NHS COVID-19 app</a> if you enter a venue that has an official NHS COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code poster at the entrance – alternatively, you can provide your contact details</li>
</ul>

<p>Treat transport staff with respect and follow instructions from your transport operator. This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notices about which seats to use or how to queue</li>
  <li>additional screens, barriers or floor markings</li>
  <li>requests to board through different doors or to move to less busy areas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transport support services for disabled people</h3>

<p>All <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-disabled">transport support services for disabled people</a> are still available. You can contact providers in advance to understand the COVID-secure measures they have put in place to keep you safe on your journey. For more information, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rights-of-disabled-passengers-on-transport">check your rights as a disabled passenger</a> before you travel.</p>

<h3>Seek assistance if you need it</h3>

<p>If you require assistance when travelling, contact your transport operator as you would normally do.</p>

<p>If any problems arise or you feel ill during your journey, speak to a member of transport staff. In the case of an emergency, contact the emergency services as you normally would.</p>

<p>If you need help, try to <a class="govuk-link" href="#social-distancing">keep a suitable distance from members of staff</a>.  If this isn’t possible, try to avoid physical contact and keep the time you spend near staff as short as possible.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Where travel is necessary, consider whether children could walk or cycle, accompanied by a responsible adult or carer, where appropriate.</p>

<p><a href="#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">Social distancing applies to children</a> as well as adults. Children should keep their distance from people who are not in their household or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubble</a> while on public transport and in enclosed or substantially enclosed public areas of transport hubs.</p>

<p>If this isn’t possible, children should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid physical contact</li>
  <li>face away from others</li>
  <li>keep the time spent near others as short as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Children under the age of 3 should not wear face coverings. Children aged from 3 to 10 can wear face coverings, but they are not required to.</p>

<p>If you are the responsible adult or carer travelling with children, help them to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minimise the surfaces they touch</li>
  <li>maintain their distance from others</li>
  <li>wear their face covering</li>
  <li>wash their hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise their hands as soon as possible after the end of your journey</li>
</ul>

<p>Where relevant, consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers">travel guidance for educational settings</a>.</p>

<h3>Completing your journey</h3>

<p>When finishing your journey:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider walking or cycling from the station or stop you arrived at</li>
  <li>wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands as soon as possible – do the same for children who have travelled with you</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taxis and private hire vehicles</h2>

<p>If you are travelling by taxi, aside from the driver, it is advisable to limit who you travel with to people in your household or support bubble. You can travel in a group of up to 6 people from a number of households or a group of any size from no more than 2 households unless you are travelling for a reason that is exempt.</p>

<p>Even after you have received a vaccine, you should continue to apply safety measures, by wearing a face covering and adhering to social distancing guidance, when using taxis or private hire vehicles.</p>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> when using taxis or private hire vehicles. You will be breaking the law if you fail to do so and could be fined. A taxi driver or private hire vehicle operator will be entitled to refuse to accept you if you do not wear a face covering, unless you are exempt from this requirement.</p>

<p>You should stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre while wearing a face covering.</p>

<p>Follow the advice of the operator and driver. For example, you may be asked to sit in the back left-hand seat if travelling alone. You may want to check with your taxi or private hire operator before travelling if they have put any additional measures in place.</p>

<p>You should use contactless payment if possible, or find out if you can pay online in advance.</p>

<p>Be aware of the surfaces you touch. Be careful not to touch your face. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when coughing or sneezing.</p>

<p>When finishing your journey, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Aviation, ferries and maritime transport</h2>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> when travelling on a ferry, hovercraft (or other passenger vessel) or aircraft in England.</p>

<p>This applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in airspace over England, when you are on board an aircraft that took off from, or is to land at, a place in England</li>
  <li>in the English territorial sea, when you are on board a vessel that departed from, or is to dock at, a place in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also wear a face covering at airports, as well as at ports and terminals used by vessels providing a public transport service.</p>

<p>If you do not wear a face covering in these settings, you will be breaking the law and could be fined.</p>

<p>Some people <a class="govuk-link" href="#exemptions-face-coverings">don’t have to wear a face covering</a> for health, age or disability reasons.</p>

<p>It is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering.</p>

  <li>if you have a physical or mental illness or impairment, or a disability that means you cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering</li>
  <li>if putting on, wearing or removing a face covering would cause you severe distress</li>
  <li>if you are travelling with, or providing help to, someone who relies on lip reading to communicate</li>
  <li>if you are travelling to avoid injury or escape the risk of harm, and you do not have a face covering with you</li>
  <li>if you need to remove it during your journey to avoid harm or injury or the risk of harm or injury to yourself or others</li>
  <li>if you need to eat, drink, or take medication on public transport</li>
  <li>if you are asked to remove your face covering by a police officer or other official, for example, to check your railcard</li>
  <li>in other situations set out in further <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-you-do-not-need-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">government face covering guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enforcement of face coverings on public transport and in substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs</h3>

<p>You are not allowed to get on public transport or enter substantially enclosed areas of transport hubs if you are not wearing a face covering, unless you have an <a href="#exemptions-face-coverings" class="govuk-link">exemption or a legitimate reason for not wearing one</a>. Transport staff may tell you not to board or ask you to get off.</p>

<p>If you refuse to wear a face covering, you can receive a fine from the police or Transport for London enforcement officers. The fixed penalty notice will require you to pay £200, which is reduced to £100 if paid within 14 days.</p>

<p>Repeat offenders receiving fines either on public transport or in an indoor place will have their fines doubled on each subsequent offence up to a maximum value of £6,400. After the first offence, there will be no discount. As an example, receiving a second fine will amount to £400 and a third fine will be £800. A sixth fine and all subsequent fines will be £6,400.</p>
