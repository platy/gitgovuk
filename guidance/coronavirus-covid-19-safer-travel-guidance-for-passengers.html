<h2>Travel safely during the coronavirus outbreak</h2>

<p>The government has introduced new temporary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) Omicron variant to slow its arrival and spread and to safeguard the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#face-coverings">Face coverings</a> are now mandatory in transport hubs and public transport, including taxis and private hire vehicles.</p>
</div>

<p>Following this guidance will help you stay safe and protect others by controlling the spread. Every action to help reduce the spread will reduce any further resurgence of the virus in the coming months.</p>

<p>Before travelling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#keeping-yourself-and-others-safe">how to stay safe and prevent the spread</a>
</li>
  <li>download the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</a> before you travel, if possible, and check in where you see official <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code posters</li>
</ul>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> when travelling inside a public transport vehicle and when in indoor transport hubs in England, unless you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#if-you-are-not-able-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<p>Help keep yourself, other passengers and transport staff safe by taking the following precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plan your journey and check your route</li>
  <li>open or keep windows open for ventilation where it is possible for you to do so</li>
  <li>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</li>
  <li>avoid touching your face</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when coughing or sneezing</li>
  <li>dispose of waste safely, including items such as used disposable face coverings</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not travel at all if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are experiencing any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/" rel="external">COVID-19 symptoms</a>, even if they are mild</li>
  <li>are self-isolating</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a contact of someone who has COVID-19 and you are fully vaccinated, or aged under 18 years 6 months, you are not required to self-isolate unless that person has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection</a>.</p>

<p>Find out whether you need to self-isolate and how you can protect others if you:</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>If you get any COVID-19 symptoms, self-isolate immediately and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a PCR test</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">Find out more about what to do if you have COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to England only.</p>

<p>If you are crossing from England into Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales, you should plan ahead and ensure you understand and comply with the rules for the whole of your journey.</p>

<p>Check the guidance for other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-regulations-guidance-what-restrictions-mean-you" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance for Northern Ireland</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Travel and coronavirus testing</h2>

<p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus, even if they are mild, you must stay at home while you are waiting for a home self-sampling kit, a test site appointment or a test result. If you need to leave your home to get to a test site, limit your contact with other people and return home immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>If possible, walk, cycle or drive in a private vehicle alone to the test site. If you need to use public transport or are using a private vehicle with other people, follow the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#travel-safely-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">how to travel safely to keep yourself, other passengers and public transport staff safe</a>.</p>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>COVID-19 spreads through the air by droplets and aerosols that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person. Wearing a face covering can reduce the risk to others and yourself against the spread of infection because they cover the nose and mouth, which are the main confirmed sources of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>Follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">how to wear and make a face covering</a>.</p>

<h3>Where you must wear face coverings</h3>

<p>You must wear a face covering when travelling inside a public transport vehicle and when in indoor transport hubs in England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>public transport services (aeroplanes, trains, trams, buses, coaches and ferries), taxis and private hire vehicles</li>
  <li>transport hubs (airports, rail and tram stations and terminals, maritime ports and terminals, bus and coach stations and terminals)</li>
  <li>all settings within a transport hub, except for hospitality</li>
</ul>

<p>Face coverings must be worn in any car or small van during a professionally delivered driving lesson, a practical driving test, or during one of the practical tests for giving driving instruction. They must also be worn in all HGV lessons and tests.</p>

<p>Read separate guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-lessons-learning-to-drive" class="govuk-link">driving lessons and learning to drive</a>.</p>

<p>You are expected to wear a face covering before entering any of these settings and must keep it on until you leave unless you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#if-you-are-not-able-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<p>The requirement does not include motorway service areas, other than those parts of the motorway service area where the requirement otherwise does apply, such as in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shops and enclosed shopping areas</li>
  <li>any premises connected to the motorway service area functioning as a transport hub from which scheduled public transport services are operating</li>
</ul>

<p>In other indoor settings where a face covering is not legally required, you should still continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>You do not need to wear a face covering in a hospitality setting that is within a transport hub or on public transport. This includes premises where food and drink is consumed inside transport hubs, and buffet cars or dining areas on trains.</p>

<p>Read separate guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">making face coverings, exemptions cards and what to do if you cannot wear one</a>.</p>

<p>The police, police community support officers, and transport operators can take measures if members of the public do not comply with this law without a valid exemption or a reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>Transport operators can deny access to transport hubs or public transport services if a passenger is not wearing a face covering or direct them to wear one or leave.</p>

<p>If necessary, the police and Transport for London (<abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>) officers have enforcement powers, including issuing fines of £200 (reduced to £100 if paid within 14 days) for the first offence.</p>

<p>Repeat offenders receiving fines on public transport, in a transport hub, or in another indoor setting will have their fines doubled for each subsequent offence. After the first offence there will be no discount. For example, receiving a second fine will amount to £400 and a third fine will be £800, up to a maximum value of £6,400.</p>

<p>These laws apply while you are in England. If travelling from any other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nation, or from abroad, you will be required to wear a face covering when you enter England, regardless of the rules in the nation you are transiting from, unless you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#if-you-are-not-able-to-wear-a-face-covering">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<p>When wearing a face covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is important to wash or sanitise your hands before and after touching your face covering</li>
  <li>use a ‘black bag’ waste bin or litter bin to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste" class="govuk-link">dispose</a> of it – you should not put face coverings in a recycling bin or drop them as litter</li>
  <li>be mindful that a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound</li>
</ul>

<p>You should remove your face covering if asked to do so by a police officer or other relevant person.</p>

<p>The rules for wearing face coverings may be different in the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations. Check the guidance before travelling from England to one of the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Walking and cycling</h2>

<p>When travelling, you may decide to walk or <a rel="external" href="https://www.think.gov.uk/cycle-safety" class="govuk-link">cycle</a>  to your destination or for part of your journey.</p>

<p>If you decide to walk or cycle, your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">local council</a> can help you plan your journey by providing maps showing dedicated paths and routes.</p>

<p>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands before and after cycling.</p>

<p>Consider making a <a class="govuk-link" href="#checklists-for-safer-travel">list of items to take with you</a>.</p>

<h2>Private cars and other vehicles</h2>

<p>You should wear a [face covering](#face-coverings in crowded and enclosed areas where you come into contact with people you do not usually meet. It is recommended you wear a face covering when travelling in a private vehicle with people you do not usually meet.</p>

<p>Plan your route, including any breaks, before setting out.</p>

<p>Download the <a rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</a>, if possible.</p>

<p>On your journey, open windows to let fresh air in where possible.</p>

<p>At garages, petrol stations and motorway services, where possible, check in using the <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</a> if you enter a venue that has an official <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code poster at the entrance. Alternatively, you can provide your contact details.</p>

<p>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands often, and always when exiting or re-entering your vehicle.</p>

<h2>Public transport</h2>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> when travelling inside a public transport vehicle and when in indoor transport hubs in England.</p>

<p>If you do not wear a face covering in these settings you could be fined, unless you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#if-youre-not-able-to-wear-a-face-covering">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

  <li>use quieter stations and stops – get off a stop early if it’s less busy</li>
  <li>keep changes to a minimum, for example, between bus and train</li>
  <li>walk for more of your journey, for example, the first or last mile</li>
  <li>download the <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</a> before travelling</li>

<h3>On your journey</h3>

<p>Even after you have received a vaccine, you should continue to follow this guidance on how to travel safely when using public transport.</p>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> when travelling inside a public transport vehicle and when in indoor transport hubs in England, unless you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#if-you-are-not-able-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<p>Help keep yourself, other passengers and transport staff safe by observing the following precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plan your journey and check your route to identify the options for reaching your destination</li>
  <li>open windows where it is possible and safe to do so</li>
  <li>wash or sanitise your hands regularly</li>
  <li>avoid touching your face</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when coughing or sneezing</li>
  <li>while waiting for a service to arrive stay outdoors, rather than indoors, where possible</li>
  <li>dispose of waste safely, including items such as used disposable face coverings</li>
  <li>respect other people and be considerate of them while travelling</li>
  <li>be aware of pregnant, older and disabled people who may require a seat or extra space</li>
  <li>where possible, check in using the <a rel="external" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</a> if you enter a venue that has an official <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code poster at the entrance – alternatively, you can provide your contact details</li>
</ul>

<p>Treat transport staff with respect and follow instructions from your transport operator.</p>

<p>When finishing your journey wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands as soon as possible – do the same for children who have travelled with you</p>

<h3>Transport support services for disabled people</h3>

<p>All <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-disabled">transport support services for disabled people</a> are still available. You can contact providers in advance to understand the COVID-secure measures they have put in place to keep you safe on your journey. For more information, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rights-of-disabled-passengers-on-transport">check your rights as a disabled passenger</a> before you travel.</p>

<h3>Seek assistance if you need it</h3>

<p>If you require assistance when travelling, contact your transport operator as you would normally do.</p>

<p>If any problems arise or you feel ill during your journey, speak to a member of transport staff. In the case of an emergency, contact the emergency services as you normally would</p>

<h2>Taxis and private hire vehicles</h2>

<p>Even after you have received a vaccine, you should continue to follow this guidance on how to travel safely when using taxis or private hire vehicles.</p>

<p>Follow the advice of the operator and driver. For example, you may be asked to sit in the back left-hand seat if travelling alone. You may want to check with your taxi or private hire operator before travelling if they have put any additional measures in place.</p>

<p>You must wear a <a href="#face-coverings" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> when using taxis or private hire vehicles, unless you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#if-you-are-not-able-to-wear-a-face-covering">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<p>You should use contactless payment if possible, or find out if you can pay online in advance.</p>

<p>Where possible open windows for ventilation when in the vehicle.</p>

<p>Be aware of the surfaces you touch. Be careful not to touch your face. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when coughing or sneezing.</p>

<p>When finishing your journey, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise your hands as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Aviation, ferries and maritime transport</h2>

  <li>in the English territorial sea, when you are indoors on board a vessel which departed from, or is to dock at, a place in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You must wear a face covering when indoors at airports as well as at ports and terminals used by vessels providing a public transport service.</p>

<p>If you do not wear a face covering in these settings you could be fined, unless you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#if-youre-not-able-to-wear-a-face-covering">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<p>Even after you have received a vaccine, you should continue to follow this guidance on how to travel safely.</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete a passenger locator form</li>
  <li>take any COVID-19 tests</li>

<h3>Travelling from England</h3>

<p>You may leave England to travel to other parts of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. However, there may be restrictions in place in the area you intend to travel to which prevent you from travelling. You may only be able to travel for certain reasons, such as work.
