<p>This guidance will apply from exit day in line with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/791/contents/made">Medical Devices (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019 </a>.</p>

<p>This guidance sets out how medical devices will be regulated in the UK in a no-deal Brexit scenario.</p>

<p>In a no deal scenario the UK’s current participation in the European regulatory network for medical devices would end, and theMHRA would take on the responsibilities for the UK market currently undertaken through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> system.</p>

<p>This guidance provides further detail on how the UK system would operate, including for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>getting your device certified</li>
  <li>CE marking your device</li>
  <li>registering your device with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These proposals are still subject to parliamentary approval of the changes to the relevant statutory instruments that are required to bring these proposals into law.</p>

<p>This guidance will apply from exit day in line with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/791/contents/made">Medical Devices (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019 </a>.</p>

<p>This notice is meant for guidance only. You should consider whether you need separate professional advice before making specific preparations.</p>

<h2 id="the-legislation">The legislation</h2>

<h3 id="how-devices-are-regulated-before-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">How devices are regulated before the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>In the UK, all devices placed on the UK market are subject to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation, which requires a manufacturer to place a CE mark on their product to attest compliance to applicable European standards.</p>

<p>Devices are regulated under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices">EU AIMDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices">EU MDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDD</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>These directives are transposed into UK law in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/contents/made">Medical Devices Regulations 2002</a> (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (<abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s powers are found in various pieces of legislation: in the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the Consumer Protection Act 1987, and the General Product Safety Regulations 2005, with some powers contained in the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr>.</p>

<p>There will also be certain pieces of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> tertiary legislation that has direct effect in UK law, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 722/2012</li>
  <li>Regulation 920/2013</li>
  <li>Directives 2003/12 and 2005/50</li>
  <li>Regulation 207/2012</li>
  <li>Regulation 2017/2185</li>
  <li>Commission Decisions 2002/364 and 2010/227</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, two new <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulations entered into force on 25 May 2017, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices (<abbr title="Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices">EU MDR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDR</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices">EU MDR</abbr> and <abbr title="Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDR</abbr> will fully apply in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States from 26 May 2020 and 2022 respectively, but devices can already be placed on the market under these new Regulations (if they fully comply with the new Regulations).</p>

<p>The UK MDR 2019 will also transpose all the key elements contained in the <abbr title="Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices">EU MDR</abbr> and <abbr title="Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDR</abbr>, which will be brought into force in line with the transitional timetable being followed by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for the full application of those two Regulations.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-a-non-compliant-medical-device-enforcement-process/how-mhra-ensures-the-safety-and-quality-of-medical-devices">guidance page which contains information about how we enforce the legislation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="role-of-those-manufacturing-and-supplying-devices">Role of those manufacturing and supplying devices</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>In the event of a no-deal Brexit, from the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> the roles and responsibilities of those manufacturing and supplying medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> will change.</p>

<p>Based on the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/brexit-%E2%80%93-guidance-stakeholders-impact-field-industrial-products_en">European Commission’s Notice to Stakeholders</a> of 22 January 2018, we understand that UK-based Authorised Representatives will no longer be recognised in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Under UK legislation a new role, known as a UK Responsible Person, will be created for manufacturers based outside of the UK.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturers">Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/pdfs/uksi_20020618_en.pdf"><abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> sets out requirements that a manufacturer must meet. Manufacturers seeking conformity with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directives transposed by that statutory instrument should continue to follow these criteria. A new Schedule (2A) has been inserted into the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> which sets out how the Annexes to the Directives which are crossed referenced in Parts II, III and IV of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> should be read in a UK specific context after the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="action-manufacturers-must-take">Action manufacturers must take</h3>

<p>Manufacturers wishing to place a device on the UK market must first register with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> (see the section titled <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulating-medical-devices-in-the-event-of-a-no-deal-scenario#registrations">‘Registrations’</a> for more information on this).</p>

<p>Where a manufacturer is not established in the UK, it must designate a UK Responsible Person (see below) to register and act on its behalf.</p>

<p>These registration requirements are set out in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=17">regulation 7A</a> (for medical devices), <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=19">regulation 21A</a> (for active implantable medical devices) and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=20">regulation 33A</a> (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>) in the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<h3 id="authorised-representatives">Authorised Representatives</h3>
<p>For medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>), after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, any UK-based Authorised Representative will no longer be recognised under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law. This means they will not be recognised as able to carry out tasks on the manufacturer’s behalf for the purposes of placing products on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market.</p>

<p>In order to place devices on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market, manufacturers with an Authorised Representative based in the UK will need to establish a new Authorised Representative in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.</p>

<h3 id="uk-responsible-person">UK Responsible Person</h3>

<p>A new role – the UK Responsible Person – has been created under the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf"><abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019), which applies from the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. The UK Responsible Person, who must be established in the UK, acts on behalf of a manufacturer established outside the UK to carry out specified tasks in relation to the manufacturer’s obligations. This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-as-a-manufacturer-to-sell-medical-devices">registering</a> with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> before the device is placed on the UK market. If you are a designated UK Responsible Person of a non-UK manufacturer, we require documentary evidence supporting your position.</p>

<p>This evidence should be in the form of a headed letter (letter of designation) or signed contract, which states the company name and address for both the overseas manufacturer and the UK Responsible Person. This document must state that, you, as the UK Responsible Person, are acting with the consent of the overseas manufacturer and the legislation that applies for the devices being placed on the UK market.</p>

<p>Although you may make use of resources based outside of the UK, there must be someone physically located within the UK for the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> to communicate with.</p>

<p>You must provide an address which can be used for official communications, and you must be contactable at the address provided.</p>

<p>You are also obliged to keep certain information at the disposal of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, such as declarations of conformity and technical documentation.</p>

<h3 id="importers">Importers</h3>

<p>An importer is defined as “any person established within the United Kingdom that places a device from a country outside the United Kingdom on the market”.</p>

<p>Currently, cross-sectorial legislation applies to importers, which means that you must ensure that your products are safe by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>warning consumers about potential risks</li>
  <li>providing information to help consumers understand the risks</li>
  <li>monitoring the safety of products, including immediately forwarding any complaints or reports of suspected incidents concerning a medical device you have supplied to the manufacturer</li>
  <li>taking action if a safety problem is found, including co-operating with the manufacturer concerning any Field Safety Corrective Actions</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to ensure that the device has been CE marked by the manufacturer, you should request the manufacturer’s declaration of conformity.</p>

<p>There is a guidance document <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-liability-and-safety-law">on our website which contains further advice and guidance for importers</a>.</p>

<p>If a person places a product on the market under <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=25">Part VIII</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=75">Part IX</a> of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019), a number of additional obligations will apply to importers, which will include, but are not limited to, verifying that:</p>

<h3 id="distributors">Distributors</h3>
<p>A distributor is defined as “any person in the supply chain, other than the manufacturer or the importer, that makes a device available on the market, up until the point of putting into service.”</p>

<p>Currently, cross sectorial legislation applies to distributors, which means that you must ensure that your products are safe by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>warning consumers about potential risks</li>
  <li>providing information to help consumers understand the risks</li>
  <li>monitoring the safety of products, including immediately forwarding any complaints or reports of suspected incidents concerning a medical device you have supplied to the manufacturer</li>
  <li>taking action if a safety problem is found, including co-operating with the manufacturer concerning any Field Safety Corrective Actions</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to ensure that the device has been CE marked by the manufacturer, you should request the manufacturer’s declaration of conformity.</p>

<p>Distributors – for example shops and wholesalers – are not normally liable for harm to consumers or their property caused by an unsafe product, as long as they identify the producer. But distributors of devices do have some responsibility for safety and can face enforcement action.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-liability-and-safety-law">additional advice and guidance for distributors</a>, including product liability and safety law on our website.</p>

<h3 id="parallel-importers">Parallel importers</h3>

<p>Before exit day, if you want to put a medical device which is already marketed in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country on the market in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country not intended by the manufacturer, this is known as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/parallel-imports-of-medical-devices/parallel-imports-of-medical-devices">parallel import</a>.</p>

<p>After the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, parallel importing from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> into the UK will not be possible. Any device that is imported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and placed on the UK market will be treated as a new placing on the market, with all of the relevant manufacturer requirements applying to this importer, including the requirement to register the device with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. You will also need to ensure that there is a UK Responsible Person in place for this product.</p>

<h2 id="determining-whether-your-product-is-a-device">Determining whether your product is a device</h2>

<h2 id="classification">Classification</h2>

<h3 id="overview-2">Overview</h3>

<p>Medical devices are given a classification depending on the level of risk associated with them. <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/10337/attachments/1/translations">Risk classification rules</a> set out in the legislation determine which risk class the device falls into.</p>

<p>These classification rules will change from 26 May 2020 (for medical devices) and 26 May 2022 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>). These classification rules may apply to devices placed on the market before these dates if the device has followed a conformity assessment provided for in Parts VIII or IX of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>More information on these new classification rules can be in the section titled ‘Future changes to classification rules from May 2020’.</p>

<h3 id="general-medical-devices-1">General medical devices</h3>

<p>When you have established your product is a general medical device, you will need to decide which class your device falls under. The categories are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Class I – generally regarded as low risk</li>
  <li>Class IIa – generally regarded as medium risk</li>
  <li>Class IIb – generally regarded as medium risk</li>
  <li>Class III – generally regarded as high risk</li>
</ul>

<p>How a medical device is classified will depend on factors including the intended purpose of the device, how long it’s intended to be in use for and if the device:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is invasive/ surgically invasive</li>
  <li>is implantable or active</li>
  <li>contains a substance, which in its own right is considered to be a medicinal substance</li>
</ul>

<p>Accessories to medical devices are classified separately to the device. Please refer to <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/pdfs/uksi_20020618_en.pdf#page=8">regulation 7 in the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> for details on the classification of general medical devices.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/10337/attachments/1/translations">the European Commission has published a document</a> that explains all classification rules in detail. This can be a helpful tool to establish which classification your product falls under.</p>

<h3 id="active-implantable-devices">Active implantable devices</h3>

<p>Whilst active implantable medical devices and their accessories do not have a separate classification rule, due to the risk level associated with these devices and their accessories, they must follow the same conformity assessment route as for Class III medical devices.</p>

<h3 id="in-vitro-diagnostic-medical-devices-ivds-1">In vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> are categorised differently.</p>

<p><abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> can fall into four different groups. Each group will have a different conformity assessment procedure for placing devices on the market.</p>

<p>The four main groups are defined as devices that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within list A – generally regarded as high risk</li>
  <li>within list B – generally regarded as medium risk</li>
  <li>to be used for ‘self-testing’ (which refers to <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> that are intended for use by a lay-person) – generally regarded as medium risk</li>
  <li>general <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> – generally regarded as low risk</li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/pdfs/uksi_20020618_en.pdf#page=23">regulation 40 of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> for information about what list A and list B cover.</p>

<h3 id="future-changes-to-classification-rules-from-may-2020">Future changes to classification rules from May 2020</h3>

<p>The UK MDR 2019 introduces changes to classification rules for medical devices from 26 May 2020. This includes the addition of four new rules, as well as modifications to existing rules. The classification rules for medical devices can be found in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=151">Schedule 9 of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>In terms of <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, a brand new classification system will be introduced with the aim of classifying <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> based on the risk they present. This is being achieved by introducing seven classification rules from 26 May 2022, with <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> being classified into four risk classes. The classification rules for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> can be found in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=202">Schedule 23 of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>Additionally, devices without a medical purpose but with similar risk to medical devices, such as non-corrective contact lenses will be regulated as medical devices. Details on what groups will start to be considered can be found in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=175">Schedule 16 of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>This section addresses CE marking and conformity assessment for medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> and does not cover other ‘New Legislative Framework’ products. For further information on this process for other products, please refer to guidance documents issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.</p>

<p>For medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, you need to demonstrate that your device meets the requirements in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/pdfs/uksi_20020618_en.pdf"><abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>Manufacturers of low risk devices can self-declare conformity to the legislation before affixing the CE mark. Higher-risk devices medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> must be certified by an independent Conformity Assessment Body, called a Notified Body, before the CE mark can be affixed.</p>

<h3 id="ce-marking">CE marking</h3>

<p>CE marking for a device is a claim of compliance with the relevant safety, quality and performance requirements of the relevant legislation made by the manufacturer and indicates that the device is safe and performs as intended. All devices, (except custom-made devices, those intended for clinical investigations, humanitarian use devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical device">IVD</abbr> devices for performance evaluation) being placed on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market whether used in private or public hospitals and nursing homes or sold in retail outlets, must carry a CE mark.</p>

<p>After Brexit, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will continue to allow devices to be placed on the UK market that have been CE marked under and fully conform with the following applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices">EU AIMDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices">EU MDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices (<abbr title="Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices">EU MDR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDR</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>These <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directives and Regulations have been incorporated into UK law under the provisions of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<h3 id="definition-of-a-notified-body">Definition of a Notified Body</h3>

<p>For medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, medium- and high-risk devices are assessed by independent Conformity Assessment Bodies called Notified Bodies, which have been designated to assess the device is in line with the applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directive. Certification is needed before the manufacturer can CE mark the device, for all but the lowest risk devices. For medium- and high-risk devices manufacturers must have their quality system and products’ safety and performance assessed by a Notified Body, before any products can be placed on the market.</p>

<p>The assessment route depends on the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/10337/attachments/1/translations">classification</a> of the device.</p>

<p>Once the conformity assessment has been successfully completed, you can place a CE mark on your device to show that the device has met the requirements.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturer-requirements-for-low-risk-medical-devices-and-ivds">Manufacturer requirements for low-risk medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>For the lowest risk medical devices (Class I) and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> (general <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> and Class A), once you are satisfied that your device complies with the requirements, you must write a statement (known as the Declaration of Conformity) to declare this. You can then place a CE mark on the product, which means that it can be placed on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market. The UK will also allow this product to be placed on its market.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-class-1-medical-devices">guidance on Class I medical devices</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturer-requirements-for-medium--and-high-risk-medical-devices-and-ivds">Manufacturer requirements for medium- and high-risk medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>For all other medical devices (Class IIa, Class IIb, Class III and active implantable medical devices) and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> (Annex II List A and B, self-test <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, Class B, Class C and Class D), you need to declare that your device meets the requirements of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>To do this, you will need to apply to a designated Notified Body to carry out a conformity assessment to confirm your declaration.</p>

<p>For certain Class I medical devices that include sterile products or a measuring function, you will also need to apply to a Notified Body to approve and certify the parts of your manufacturing process that relates to sterility or metrology.</p>

<p>You can then place a CE mark on your product and place it on the UK market when you have received a certificate from the Notified Body.</p>

<p>We have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/476902/Conformity_assessment_routes_chart_Nov15.pdf">flow chart</a> which illustrates these conformity assessment routes.</p>

</h3>

<p>After Brexit we expect that UK-based Notified Bodies will no longer be recognised by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This means that the devices they have certified will no longer be in conformity with the applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directive. The lack of CE certification means that these devices may not legally be able to be placed on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market.</p>

<p>To support the continuity of supply of devices to the UK market, we will give UK-based Notified Bodies an ongoing legal status and continue to recognise the validity of certificates that they issued prior to the UK’s departure from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This will allow devices covered by certificates issued by UK-based Notified Bodies to continue to be placed on the UK market after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>These UK-based Notified Bodies will continue to oversee these devices and their manufacturers, to ensure continued compliance with the applicable standards of safety and performance.</p>

<h3 id="notified-bodies-that-can-be-used-from-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Notified Bodies that can be used from after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>

<p>Certificates that have already been issued by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-devices-uk-notified-bodies">UK-based Notified Bodies</a> prior to the UK’s departure from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will continue to be valid for the UK market. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will continue to oversee the activities of UK-based Notified Bodies.</p>

<p>From Exit Day, if you wish to place a new device, which requires a Notified Body to carry out a conformity assessment, on to the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market, you will need to use a <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=notifiedbody.main">Notified Body based in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State</a>. Once the conformity assessment has been successfully completed, you can place a CE mark on your device and place the product on the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market.</p>

<h2 id="labelling-requirements">Labelling requirements</h2>

<p>Relevant labelling requirements will continue to apply from the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, including the requirement for products to carry a CE mark and devices which require conformity assessment must also include the Notified Body number. This means that, should you change your Notified Body, you will be required to make the relevant changes to Notified Body numbers appearing on your device and packaging.</p>

<p>No labelling changes will be required to reflect the role of the ‘UK Responsible Person’.</p>

<h3 id="future-changes-to-labelling-requirements-from-may-2020">Future changes to labelling requirements from May 2020</h3>

<p>Changes to labelling requirements will come in to force in May 2020 for medical devices and May 2022 for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>.

<h2 id="registrations">Registrations</h2>

<h3 id="overview-5">Overview</h3>
<p>From the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, any medical device or an <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical device">IVD</abbr> placed on the UK market must be registered with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will only register manufacturers that have a registered place of business (see section on ‘Definition of ‘registered place of business’ for more information) in the UK. If the manufacturer is based outside the UK, the manufacturer must assign a UK Responsible Person that has a registered place of business in the UK. This UK Responsible Person will then assume the responsibilities of the manufacturer in terms of registering the device.</p>

<p>Before you register with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, you must ensure that your device meets all relevant legal requirements set out above.</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied that your devices meet all the relevant requirements, you can register with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. We will provide further guidance on how to register with us in due course.</p>

<h3 id="definition-of-registered-places-of-business">Definition of ‘registered places of business’</h3>

<p>If the manufacturer or its UK Responsible Person is a UK company then the “registered place of business” should be the same as its “registered office” under the Companies Act 2006. That would be the address held by the Registrar of Companies, which would have been included in the original application for company registration (and any change of address would have been notified to the Registrar).</p>

<p>In certain cases, the UK Responsible Person may not be a company. If this is the case, the person’s contact address, or any address where official documents can be sent, will need to be provided. Please note that this address will be made publicly available on the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/era/pdr.nsf/name?openpage&start=1&count=200">Public Access Registrations Database</a> (<abbr title="Public Access Registrations Database">PARD</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="post-market-surveillance-and-vigilance">Post-market surveillance and vigilance</h2>

<h3 id="overview-6">Overview</h3>

<p><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> operates the system for reporting and recording details of suspected adverse incidents relating to a medical device or <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical device">IVD</abbr> which occur in the UK. A key responsibility of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> is to investigate device-related adverse incidents or monitor investigations carried out by the manufacturer and take appropriate action to prevent or reduce the likelihood of recurrence as part of its market surveillance role. If a non-compliances are found during an investigation of a manufacturer, the manufacturer has a statutory obligation to resolve these non-compliances.</p>

<p>Once a medical device has been placed on the UK market in compliance with the applicable legislation, the manufacturer must continually monitor the safety and performance of their device. The manufacturer must submit vigilance reports to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> when certain incidents occur in the UK involving their device and take appropriate safety action when required. The manufacturer must ensure the device meets appropriate standards of safety and performance for as long as it is in use.</p>

<p>From the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, where a manufacturer is based outside of the UK, it must have in place a UK Responsible Person. This UK Responsible Person will be required to meet certain reporting requirements, as set out in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=17">regulation 7A</a> (for medical devices), <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=19">regulation 21A</a> (for active implantable medical devices) and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=20">regulation 33A</a> (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>) in the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>From 26 May 2020 (for medical devices) and May 2022 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>) new requirements relating to a manufacturer’s post market surveillance system will be in place that will require manufacturers to adhere to increased requirements around post-market surveillance and vigilance. This will include maintaining a post-market surveillance plan and issuing periodic safety update reports (PSURs). Further information for post-market surveillance requirements can be found under <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=68">regulations 121 to 124 (for medical devices)</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=110">regulations 186 to 189 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>)</a> of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>Additionally, the new vigilance requirements define specific reporting requirements which include but are not limited to defined time frames for notifying the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of incidents and the preparation of manufacturer reports after the occurrence of incidents.

<p>##Details
This guidance will apply from exit day in line with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/791/contents/made">Medical Devices (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019 </a>.</p>

<p>This guidance sets out how medical devices will be regulated in the UK in a no-deal Brexit scenario.</p>

<p>In a no deal scenario the UK’s current participation in the European regulatory network for medical devices would end, and theMHRA would take on the responsibilities for the UK market currently undertaken through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> system.</p>

<p>This guidance provides further detail on how the UK system would operate, including for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>getting your device certified</li>
  <li>CE marking your device</li>
  <li>registering your device with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These proposals are still subject to parliamentary approval of the changes to the relevant statutory instruments that are required to bring these proposals into law.</p>

<p>This guidance will apply from exit day in line with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/791/contents/made">Medical Devices (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019 </a>.</p>

<p>This notice is meant for guidance only. You should consider whether you need separate professional advice before making specific preparations.</p>

<h3 id="how-devices-are-regulated-before-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-1">How devices are regulated before the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>In the UK, all devices placed on the UK market are subject to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation, which requires a manufacturer to place a CE mark on their product to attest compliance to applicable European standards.</p>

<p>Devices are regulated under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices">EU AIMDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices">EU MDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDD</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>These directives are transposed into UK law in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/contents/made">Medical Devices Regulations 2002</a> (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (<abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s powers are found in various pieces of legislation: in the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the Consumer Protection Act 1987, and the General Product Safety Regulations 2005, with some powers contained in the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr>.</p>

<p>There will also be certain pieces of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> tertiary legislation that has direct effect in UK law, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 722/2012</li>
  <li>Regulation 920/2013</li>
  <li>Directives 2003/12 and 2005/50</li>
  <li>Regulation 207/2012</li>
  <li>Regulation 2017/2185</li>
  <li>Commission Decisions 2002/364 and 2010/227</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, two new <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulations entered into force on 25 May 2017, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices (<abbr title="Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices">EU MDR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDR</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices">EU MDR</abbr> and <abbr title="Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDR</abbr> will fully apply in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States from 26 May 2020 and 2022 respectively, but devices can already be placed on the market under these new Regulations (if they fully comply with the new Regulations).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will continue to perform market surveillance of medical devices on the UK market and be able to take a decision over the marketing and supplying of a device in the UK, regardless of the position of the European regulatory network, or any post-exit decision of the European Court of Justice.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-a-non-compliant-medical-device-enforcement-process/how-mhra-ensures-the-safety-and-quality-of-medical-devices">guidance page which contains information about how we enforce the legislation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="role-of-those-manufacturing-and-supplying-devices-1">Role of those manufacturing and supplying devices</h2>

<h3 id="overview-7">Overview</h3>
<p>In the event of a no-deal Brexit, from the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> the roles and responsibilities of those manufacturing and supplying medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> will change.</p>

<p>Based on the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/brexit-%E2%80%93-guidance-stakeholders-impact-field-industrial-products_en">European Commission’s Notice to Stakeholders</a> of 22 January 2018, we understand that UK-based Authorised Representatives will no longer be recognised in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Under UK legislation a new role, known as a UK Responsible Person, will be created for manufacturers based outside of the UK.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturers-1">Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/pdfs/uksi_20020618_en.pdf"><abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> sets out requirements that a manufacturer must meet. Manufacturers seeking conformity with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directives transposed by that statutory instrument should continue to follow these criteria. A new Schedule (2A) has been inserted into the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> which sets out how the Annexes to the Directives which are crossed referenced in Parts II, III and IV of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> should be read in a UK specific context after the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="action-manufacturers-must-take-1">Action manufacturers must take</h3>

<p>Manufacturers wishing to place a device on the UK market must first register with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> (see the section titled <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulating-medical-devices-in-the-event-of-a-no-deal-scenario#registrations">‘Registrations’</a> for more information on this).</p>

<p>Where a manufacturer is not established in the UK, it must designate a UK Responsible Person (see below) to register and act on its behalf.</p>

<p>These registration requirements are set out in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=17">regulation 7A</a> (for medical devices), <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=19">regulation 21A</a> (for active implantable medical devices) and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=20">regulation 33A</a> (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>) in the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<h3 id="additional-responsibilities-for-manufacturers-of-medical-devices-1">Additional responsibilities for manufacturers of medical devices</h3>

These additional responsibilities include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>correctly classifying the device against the new risk classification criteria</li>
  <li>meeting general safety and performance requirements, including for labelling and technical documentation and quality management systems</li>
  <li>meeting increased requirements for clinical evidence</li>
  <li>having a person responsible for regulatory compliance in place</li>
  <li>meeting the new vigilance reporting timescales and creating an annual periodic safety update report</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about these additional manufacturers’ obligations can be found at <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=36">regulation 76 (for medical devices)</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=85">regulation 145 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>)</a> of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<h3 id="authorised-representatives-1">Authorised Representatives</h3>
<p>For medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>), after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, any UK-based Authorised Representative will no longer be recognised under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law. This means they will not be recognised as able to carry out tasks on the manufacturer’s behalf for the purposes of placing products on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market.</p>

<p>In order to place devices on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market, manufacturers with an Authorised Representative based in the UK will need to establish a new Authorised Representative in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.</p>

<h3 id="uk-responsible-person-1">UK Responsible Person</h3>

<p>A new role – the UK Responsible Person – has been created under the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf"><abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019), which applies from the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. The UK Responsible Person, who must be established in the UK, acts on behalf of a manufacturer established outside the UK to carry out specified tasks in relation to the manufacturer’s obligations. This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-as-a-manufacturer-to-sell-medical-devices">registering</a> with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> before the device is placed on the UK market. If you are a designated UK Responsible Person of a non-UK manufacturer, we require documentary evidence supporting your position.</p>

<p>This evidence should be in the form of a headed letter (letter of designation) or signed contract, which states the company name and address for both the overseas manufacturer and the UK Responsible Person. This document must state that, you, as the UK Responsible Person, are acting with the consent of the overseas manufacturer and the legislation that applies for the devices being placed on the UK market.</p>

<p>Although you may make use of resources based outside of the UK, there must be someone physically located within the UK for the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> to communicate with.</p>

<p>You must provide an address which can be used for official communications, and you must be contactable at the address provided.</p>

<p>You are also obliged to keep certain information at the disposal of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, such as declarations of conformity and technical documentation.</p>

<p>You can read more about the UK Responsible Person’s obligations in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=39">regulation 77 (for medical devices)</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=87">regulation 146 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>)</a> of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<h3 id="importers-1">Importers</h3>

<p>An importer is defined as “any person established within the United Kingdom that places a device from a country outside the United Kingdom on the market”.</p>

<p>Currently, cross-sectorial legislation applies to importers, which means that you must ensure that your products are safe by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>warning consumers about potential risks</li>
  <li>providing information to help consumers understand the risks</li>
  <li>monitoring the safety of products, including immediately forwarding any complaints or reports of suspected incidents concerning a medical device you have supplied to the manufacturer</li>
  <li>taking action if a safety problem is found, including co-operating with the manufacturer concerning any Field Safety Corrective Actions</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to ensure that the device has been CE marked by the manufacturer, you should request the manufacturer’s declaration of conformity.</p>

<p>There is a guidance document <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-liability-and-safety-law">on our website which contains further advice and guidance for importers</a>.</p>

<p>If a person places a product on the market under <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=25">Part VIII</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=75">Part IX</a> of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019), a number of additional obligations will apply to importers, which will include, but are not limited to, verifying that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the device has been CE marked</li>
  <li>the manufacturer is identified and has a UK Responsible Person, if required</li>
  <li>the device has been labelled correctly and a Unique Device Identifier (<abbr title="Unique Device Identifier">UDI</abbr>) has been assigned to the device</li>

<h3 id="distributors-1">Distributors</h3>
<p>A distributor is defined as “any person in the supply chain, other than the manufacturer or the importer, that makes a device available on the market, up until the point of putting into service.”</p>

<p>Currently, cross sectorial legislation applies to distributors, which means that you must ensure that your products are safe by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>warning consumers about potential risks</li>
  <li>providing information to help consumers understand the risks</li>
  <li>monitoring the safety of products, including immediately forwarding any complaints or reports of suspected incidents concerning a medical device you have supplied to the manufacturer</li>
  <li>taking action if a safety problem is found, including co-operating with the manufacturer concerning any Field Safety Corrective Actions</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to ensure that the device has been CE marked by the manufacturer, you should request the manufacturer’s declaration of conformity.</p>

<p>Distributors – for example shops and wholesalers – are not normally liable for harm to consumers or their property caused by an unsafe product, as long as they identify the producer. But distributors of devices do have some responsibility for safety and can face enforcement action.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-liability-and-safety-law">additional advice and guidance for distributors</a>, including product liability and safety law on our website.</p>

<h3 id="parallel-importers-1">Parallel importers</h3>

<p>Before exit day, if you want to put a medical device which is already marketed in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country on the market in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country not intended by the manufacturer, this is known as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/parallel-imports-of-medical-devices/parallel-imports-of-medical-devices">parallel import</a>.</p>

<p>After the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, parallel importing from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> into the UK will not be possible. Any device that is imported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and placed on the UK market will be treated as a new placing on the market, with all of the relevant manufacturer requirements applying to this importer, including the requirement to register the device with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. You will also need to ensure that there is a UK Responsible Person in place for this product.</p>

<h2 id="determining-whether-your-product-is-a-device-1">Determining whether your product is a device</h2>

<h3 id="overview-8">Overview</h3>
<p>Before you place your product on the market, you will need to ensure it meets the relevant definition set out in the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr>. There are three main types of devices: a medical device, an active implantable medical device, or an in vitro diagnostic medical device.</p>

<p>These definitions will change from 26 May 2020 (for medical devices) and 26 May 2022 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>). More information on these new definitions can be found below.</p>

<h2 id="classification-1">Classification</h2>

<h3 id="overview-9">Overview</h3>

<p>Medical devices are given a classification depending on the level of risk associated with them. <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/10337/attachments/1/translations">Risk classification rules</a> set out in the legislation determine which risk class the device falls into.</p>

<p>These classification rules will change from 26 May 2020 (for medical devices) and 26 May 2022 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>). These classification rules may apply to devices placed on the market before these dates if the device has followed a conformity assessment provided for in Parts VIII or IX of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>More information on these new classification rules can be in the section titled ‘Future changes to classification rules from May 2020’.</p>

<h3 id="general-medical-devices-3">General medical devices</h3>

<p>When you have established your product is a general medical device, you will need to decide which class your device falls under. The categories are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Class I – generally regarded as low risk</li>
  <li>Class IIa – generally regarded as medium risk</li>
  <li>Class IIb – generally regarded as medium risk</li>
  <li>Class III – generally regarded as high risk</li>
</ul>

<p>How a medical device is classified will depend on factors including the intended purpose of the device, how long it’s intended to be in use for and if the device:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is invasive/ surgically invasive</li>
  <li>is implantable or active</li>
  <li>contains a substance, which in its own right is considered to be a medicinal substance</li>
</ul>

<p>Accessories to medical devices are classified separately to the device. Please refer to <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/pdfs/uksi_20020618_en.pdf#page=8">regulation 7 in the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> for details on the classification of general medical devices.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/10337/attachments/1/translations">the European Commission has published a document</a> that explains all classification rules in detail. This can be a helpful tool to establish which classification your product falls under.</p>

<h3 id="active-implantable-devices-1">Active implantable devices</h3>

<p>Whilst active implantable medical devices and their accessories do not have a separate classification rule, due to the risk level associated with these devices and their accessories, they must follow the same conformity assessment route as for Class III medical devices.</p>

<h3 id="in-vitro-diagnostic-medical-devices-ivds-3">In vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> are categorised differently.</p>

<p><abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> can fall into four different groups. Each group will have a different conformity assessment procedure for placing devices on the market.</p>

<p>The four main groups are defined as devices that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within list A – generally regarded as high risk</li>
  <li>within list B – generally regarded as medium risk</li>
  <li>to be used for ‘self-testing’ (which refers to <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> that are intended for use by a lay-person) – generally regarded as medium risk</li>
  <li>general <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> – generally regarded as low risk</li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/pdfs/uksi_20020618_en.pdf#page=23">regulation 40 of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> for information about what list A and list B cover.</p>

<h3 id="future-changes-to-classification-rules-from-may-2020-1">Future changes to classification rules from May 2020</h3>

<p>The UK MDR 2019 introduces changes to classification rules for medical devices from 26 May 2020. This includes the addition of four new rules, as well as modifications to existing rules. The classification rules for medical devices can be found in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=151">Schedule 9 of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>In terms of <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, a brand new classification system will be introduced with the aim of classifying <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> based on the risk they present. This is being achieved by introducing seven classification rules from 26 May 2022, with <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> being classified into four risk classes. The classification rules for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> can be found in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=202">Schedule 23 of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>Additionally, devices without a medical purpose but with similar risk to medical devices, such as non-corrective contact lenses will be regulated as medical devices. Details on what groups will start to be considered can be found in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=175">Schedule 16 of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<h2 id="clinical-investigations-and-performance-evaluations-1">Clinical investigations and performance evaluations</h2>

<h3 id="overview-10">Overview</h3>

<p>The UK will continue to recognise existing clinical investigation approvals – both for regulatory and ethics approvals – and there will be no need to re-apply. UK clinical investigation applications will continue to be authorised by <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and ethics committees as they are at present.</p>

<p>Manufacturers must hold clinical data to support claims made for all types of medical devices. This will be based on a robust evaluation of all clinical data pertaining to the device and may include evidence from clinical investigations. See more information on <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/guidance/index_en.htm#informative">clinical evaluations</a> by the European Commission.</p>

<h2 id="ce-marking-your-devices-and-conformity-assessment-1">CE marking your devices and conformity assessment</h2>

<h3 id="overview-11">Overview</h3>

<p>This section addresses CE marking and conformity assessment for medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> and does not cover other ‘New Legislative Framework’ products. For further information on this process for other products, please refer to guidance documents issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.</p>

<p>For medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, you need to demonstrate that your device meets the requirements in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/pdfs/uksi_20020618_en.pdf"><abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr></a> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>Manufacturers of low risk devices can self-declare conformity to the legislation before affixing the CE mark. Higher-risk devices medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> must be certified by an independent Conformity Assessment Body, called a Notified Body, before the CE mark can be affixed.</p>

<h3 id="ce-marking-1">CE marking</h3>

<p>CE marking for a device is a claim of compliance with the relevant safety, quality and performance requirements of the relevant legislation made by the manufacturer and indicates that the device is safe and performs as intended. All devices, (except custom-made devices, those intended for clinical investigations, humanitarian use devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical device">IVD</abbr> devices for performance evaluation) being placed on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market whether used in private or public hospitals and nursing homes or sold in retail outlets, must carry a CE mark.</p>

<p>After Brexit, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will continue to allow devices to be placed on the UK market that have been CE marked under and fully conform with the following applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices">EU AIMDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices">EU MDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices (<abbr title="Regulation 2017/745 on medical devices">EU MDR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (<abbr title="Regulation 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices">EU IVDR</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>These <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directives and Regulations have been incorporated into UK law under the provisions of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<h3 id="definition-of-a-notified-body-1">Definition of a Notified Body</h3>

<p>For medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, medium- and high-risk devices are assessed by independent Conformity Assessment Bodies called Notified Bodies, which have been designated to assess the device is in line with the applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directive. Certification is needed before the manufacturer can CE mark the device, for all but the lowest risk devices. For medium- and high-risk devices manufacturers must have their quality system and products’ safety and performance assessed by a Notified Body, before any products can be placed on the market.</p>

<p>The assessment route depends on the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/10337/attachments/1/translations">classification</a> of the device.</p>

<p>Once the conformity assessment has been successfully completed, you can place a CE mark on your device to show that the device has met the requirements.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturer-requirements-for-low-risk-medical-devices-and-ivds-1">Manufacturer requirements for low-risk medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>For the lowest risk medical devices (Class I) and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> (general <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> and Class A), once you are satisfied that your device complies with the requirements, you must write a statement (known as the Declaration of Conformity) to declare this. You can then place a CE mark on the product, which means that it can be placed on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market. The UK will also allow this product to be placed on its market.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-class-1-medical-devices">guidance on Class I medical devices</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturer-requirements-for-medium--and-high-risk-medical-devices-and-ivds-1">Manufacturer requirements for medium- and high-risk medical devices and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>For all other medical devices (Class IIa, Class IIb, Class III and active implantable medical devices) and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> (Annex II List A and B, self-test <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, Class B, Class C and Class D), you need to declare that your device meets the requirements of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>To do this, you will need to apply to a designated Notified Body to carry out a conformity assessment to confirm your declaration.</p>

<p>For certain Class I medical devices that include sterile products or a measuring function, you will also need to apply to a Notified Body to approve and certify the parts of your manufacturing process that relates to sterility or metrology.</p>

<p>You can then place a CE mark on your product and place it on the UK market when you have received a certificate from the Notified Body.</p>

<p>We have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/476902/Conformity_assessment_routes_chart_Nov15.pdf">flow chart</a> which illustrates these conformity assessment routes.</p>

</h3>

<p>After Brexit we expect that UK-based Notified Bodies will no longer be recognised by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This means that the devices they have certified will no longer be in conformity with the applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Directive. The lack of CE certification means that these devices may not legally be able to be placed on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market.</p>

<p>To support the continuity of supply of devices to the UK market, we will give UK-based Notified Bodies an ongoing legal status and continue to recognise the validity of certificates that they issued prior to the UK’s departure from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This will allow devices covered by certificates issued by UK-based Notified Bodies to continue to be placed on the UK market after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>These UK-based Notified Bodies will continue to oversee these devices and their manufacturers, to ensure continued compliance with the applicable standards of safety and performance.</p>

<h3 id="notified-bodies-that-can-be-used-from-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-1">Notified Bodies that can be used from after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>

The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will continue to oversee the activities of UK-based Notified Bodies.</p>

<p>From Exit Day, if you wish to place a new device, which requires a Notified Body to carry out a conformity assessment, on to the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market, you will need to use a <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=notifiedbody.main">Notified Body based in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State</a>. Once the conformity assessment has been successfully completed, you can place a CE mark on your device and place the product on the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market.</p>

<h2 id="labelling-requirements-1">Labelling requirements</h2>

<p>Relevant labelling requirements will continue to apply from the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, including the requirement for products to carry a CE mark and devices which require conformity assessment must also include the Notified Body number. This means that, should you change your Notified Body, you will be required to make the relevant changes to Notified Body numbers appearing on your device and packaging.</p>

<p>No labelling changes will be required to reflect the role of the ‘UK Responsible Person’.</p>

<h3 id="future-changes-to-labelling-requirements-from-may-2020-1">Future changes to labelling requirements from May 2020</h3>

<h2 id="registrations-1">Registrations</h2>

<h3 id="overview-12">Overview</h3>
<p>From the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, any medical device or an <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical device">IVD</abbr> placed on the UK market must be registered with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will only register manufacturers that have a registered place of business (see section on ‘Definition of ‘registered place of business’ for more information) in the UK. If the manufacturer is based outside the UK, the manufacturer must assign a UK Responsible Person that has a registered place of business in the UK. This UK Responsible Person will then assume the responsibilities of the manufacturer in terms of registering the device.</p>

<p>Before you register with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, you must ensure that your device meets all relevant legal requirements set out above.</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied that your devices meet all the relevant requirements, you can register with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. We will provide further guidance on how to register with us in due course.</p>

<h3 id="definition-of-registered-places-of-business-1">Definition of ‘registered places of business’</h3>

<p>If the manufacturer or its UK Responsible Person is a UK company then the “registered place of business” should be the same as its “registered office” under the Companies Act 2006. That would be the address held by the Registrar of Companies, which would have been included in the original application for company registration (and any change of address would have been notified to the Registrar).</p>

<p>In certain cases, the UK Responsible Person may not be a company. If this is the case, the person’s contact address, or any address where official documents can be sent, will need to be provided. Please note that this address will be made publicly available on the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/era/pdr.nsf/name?openpage&start=1&count=200">Public Access Registrations Database</a> (<abbr title="Public Access Registrations Database">PARD</abbr>).</p>

<p>To register any class of device with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, you will need to use <a rel="external" href="https://www.gmdnagency.org/">Global Medical Devices Nomenclature</a> (<abbr title="Global Medical Devices Nomenclature">GMDN</abbr>) to describe your device. You do not need to be a member of the <abbr title="Global Medical Devices Nomenclature">GMDN</abbr> Agency to find and select the appropriate <abbr title="Global Medical Devices Nomenclature">GMDN</abbr> terms within our online registration system.</p>

<p>Initially, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will require all devices to be registered at the level of <abbr title="Global Medical Devices Nomenclature">GMDN</abbr> code. If you do not know which <abbr title="Global Medical Devices Nomenclature">GMDN</abbr> code applies to your device, you will need to select the relevant description term from our system.
However, for Class III devices, you must also provide the following product information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>medical device name</li>
  <li>model</li>
  <li>catalogue or reference number</li>
</ul>

<p>These are recognised common data elements in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf-tech-rps-common-data-elements.pdf"><abbr title="International Medical Devices Regulators Forum">IMDRF</abbr> Primary Medical Device Identity information</a>.</p>

<h2 id="post-market-surveillance-and-vigilance-1">Post-market surveillance and vigilance</h2>

<h3 id="overview-13">Overview</h3>

<p><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> operates the system for reporting and recording details of suspected adverse incidents relating to a medical device or <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical device">IVD</abbr> which occur in the UK. A key responsibility of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> is to investigate device-related adverse incidents or monitor investigations carried out by the manufacturer and take appropriate action to prevent or reduce the likelihood of recurrence as part of its market surveillance role. If a non-compliances are found during an investigation of a manufacturer, the manufacturer has a statutory obligation to resolve these non-compliances.</p>

<p>Once a medical device has been placed on the UK market in compliance with the applicable legislation, the manufacturer must continually monitor the safety and performance of their device. The manufacturer must submit vigilance reports to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> when certain incidents occur in the UK involving their device and take appropriate safety action when required. The manufacturer must ensure the device meets appropriate standards of safety and performance for as long as it is in use.</p>

<p>From the day the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, where a manufacturer is based outside of the UK, it must have in place a UK Responsible Person. This UK Responsible Person will be required to meet certain reporting requirements, as set out in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=17">regulation 7A</a> (for medical devices), <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=19">regulation 21A</a> (for active implantable medical devices) and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=20">regulation 33A</a> (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>) in the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>From 26 May 2020 (for medical devices) and May 2022 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>) new requirements relating to a manufacturer’s post market surveillance system will be in place that will require manufacturers to adhere to increased requirements around post-market surveillance and vigilance. This will include maintaining a post-market surveillance plan and issuing periodic safety update reports (PSURs). Further information for post-market surveillance requirements can be found under <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=68">regulations 121 to 124 (for medical devices)</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=110">regulations 186 to 189 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>)</a> of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>

<p>Additionally, the new vigilance requirements define specific reporting requirements which include but are not limited to defined time frames for notifying the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of incidents and the preparation of manufacturer reports after the occurrence of incidents. Full information on vigilance can be found under <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=69">regulations 125 to 129 (for medical devices)</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111179260/pdfs/ukdsi_9780111179260_en.pdf#page=112">regulations 190 to 194 (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>)</a> of the <abbr title="Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No.618, as amended)">UK MDR 2002</abbr> (as amended by the UK MDR 2019).</p>
