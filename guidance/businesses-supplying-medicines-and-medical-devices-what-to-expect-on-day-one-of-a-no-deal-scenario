<p>Get ready for Brexit on 31 October. This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit. It will be updated if anything changes, including if a deal is agreed.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) is working with industry on plans to minimise any medical supply disruption following a no-deal Brexit. This guidance summaries that approach. More information about it is in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medicines-and-medical-products-continuity-of-supply-update">letter to suppliers of medicines and medical products that come to the UK from or through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Lichtenstein or Norway</a>.</p>

<h2 id="actions-for-businesses">Actions for businesses</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is asking companies supplying the UK with medicines or medical products from or through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway to include the actions set out here in their Brexit planning. Companies can now determine for themselves the right mix of these actions for their specific situation, to most effectively ensure the continued flow of supplies.</p>

<h2 id="medicines">Medicines</h2>

<p>Actions for companies supplying the UK with medicines from or through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway, should, as appropriate, include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>securing capacity for rerouting freight away from Dover and Folkstone after 31 October 2019 – to avoid the disruption expected to follow a no-deal Brexit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stockpiling a minimum of 6 weeks’ additional supply in the UK by 31 October – on top of your business-as-usual buffer stocks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>preparing logistics and supply chains to meet the new customs and border requirement for both importing and exporting - sometimes called ‘trader readiness’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensuring continued supply to the NHS as part of the contingency programme</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making alternative air freight plans for products with a short shelf-life or where production constraints mean stockpiling is not possible – for example, medical radioisotopes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>notifying <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> of your company’s plans</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will keep working with companies to ensure that plans will lead to the continuity of medical supplies after Brexit.</p>

<p>To contact <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> about planning actions, suppliers can email <a href="mailto:medicinescontingencyplanning@dhsc.gov.uk">medicinescontingencyplanning@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="medical-devices-and-clinical-consumables">Medical devices and clinical consumables</h2>

<p>In planning for Brexit, companies supplying the UK with medical products from or through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>review supply chains, assess how leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal would impact product ranges and then make contingency plans</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medicines-and-medical-products-continuity-of-supply-update"><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s letter to suppliers of medical devices and clinical consumables</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="batch-testing-and-clinical-trials">Batch testing and clinical trials</h2>

<h3 id="certification-of-medicines">Certification of medicines</h3>

<p>You must still get a UK-based Qualified Person (<abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr>) to certify the batch testing and ensure compliance with the Marketing Authorisation (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>) and Good Manufacturing Practice (<abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr>) guidelines for any medicines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>manufactured in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>manufactured in a third country and directly imported into the UK (a third country is one with which we do not have any reciprocal arrangements)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> based in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-in-a-no-deal-scenario/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-on-exit-day#approved-country-for-import-list">country approved for import</a> can still certify, release and assure compliance with the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> and <abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr> guidelines for any medicines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>manufactured in a country on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-in-a-no-deal-scenario/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-on-exit-day#approved-country-for-import-list"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s approved country for import list</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>manufactured in a third country but imported into the UK from a country on the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s approved country for import list</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This won’t require any further certification.</p>

<p>These arrangements will continue until the government thinks any further change is necessary. We’ll work with industry ahead of any changes that might impact suppliers. We’ll give at least 2 years’ notice of any changes to allow industry to fully prepare.</p>

<h3 id="supplies-for-clinical-trials-including-investigational-medicinal-products-imps">Supplies for clinical trials, including Investigational Medicinal Products (<abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Sponsors of clinical trials or investigations running in the UK should now:</p>

<p>•	review supply chains</p>

<p>•	put in place any necessary arrangements to assure supplies after Brexit</p>

<p>This includes supply chains relating to investigational medical products (<abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr>), as well as in-vitro diagnostic and other medical devices, advanced therapy medicinal products, radioisotopes and other clinical consumables.</p>

<p>Within 12 months of Brexit, sponsors should secure the services of a manufacturing and import authorisation holder for <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> and a <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> to oversee the supply of <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> from approved countries. There is no requirement to re-certify <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> for use in a clinical trial if this has already been done in an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-importation-of-investigational-medicinal-products-from-approval-countries/list-of-approved-countries-for-clinical-trials-and-investigational-medicinal-products-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal#approved-countries-for-qualified-person-qp-certification-of-investigational-medicinal-products-imps">approved country</a>.</p>

<h2 id="government-actions-to-ensure-supply-continues">Government actions to ensure supply continues</h2>

<h3 id="summary-of-government-actions">Summary of government actions</h3>

<p>In preparation for Brexit, the UK government is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>supporting suppliers to secure alternative supply routes (away from the Dover and Folkestone crossings, where delays are expected)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>encouraging buffer stocks and stockpiling (where this is practical) or asking industry or NHS Supply Chain to build up buffer stocks in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adding to normal shortage management procedures, enabling ministers to issue serious shortage protocols to pharmacists</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>securing additional warehouse space for stockpiled medicines, including ambient, refrigerated and controlled drug storage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>working with industry to improve trader readiness in preparation for the new customs procedures that will come into force on day 1 of a no-deal Brexit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changing or clarifying regulatory requirements so that companies can continue to sell their products in the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is working on these plans with trade bodies, product suppliers and the health and care system in England. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is doing this in consultation with the devolved administrations (DAs). The DAs have also been working closely on Brexit planning with their health and social care systems.</p>

<p>People can be reassured by the government’s plans for continued supply to the whole of the UK, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man following Brexit.</p>

<h3 id="re-routing-supplies">Re-routing supplies</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is procuring an express freight service able to deliver small batches within 24 hours and a 2 to 4-day pallet delivery service.</p>

<p>The Department for Transport is procuring roll-on, roll-off freight capacity on which medicines and medical products would be prioritised.</p>

<h3 id="medical-devices-and-clinical-consumables-1">Medical devices and clinical consumables</h3>

<p>Part of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s contingency planning involved analysing the supply chains of medical devices and clinical consumables. This identified the products routinely imported into the UK from other countries in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>NHS Supply Chain colleagues are now working with suppliers who import from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to increase stock held at national level.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is also facilitating the continued movement of products that go directly to NHS organisations from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has set up a working group to test and refine its contingency plans and how suppliers will interact with these processes.</p>

<h3 id="batch-testing-and-clinical-trials-1">Batch testing and clinical trials</h3>

<h4 id="certification-of-medicines-1">Certification of medicines</h4>

<p>Without a deal, after Brexit, the UK will no longer be a member of the European Medicines Agency (<abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr>).</p>

<p>We will continue to recognise batch testing of human medicines carried out in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>third countries with which the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has a Mutual Recognition Agreement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="supplies-for-clinical-trials-including-investigational-medicinal-products-imps-1">Supplies for clinical trials, including Investigational Medicinal Products (<abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The UK will continue to accept batch testing and <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification of <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> manufactured in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>

<p>There will be no change to the current arrangements for batch testing of <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> manufactured in third countries subject to UK oversight, as set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-importation-of-investigational-medicinal-products-from-approval-countries/importing-investigational-medicinal-products-imp-from-eea-to-uk">guidance about importing investigational medicinal products if the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal</a>.</p>

<h2 id="manufacturers-authorisation-licences">Manufacturer’s Authorisation licences</h2>

<p>Currently there are 2 Manufacturer’s Authorisation licences issued by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> for importing licensed medicines into the UK: manufacturer and wholesaler. These would remain the same should the UK leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturer-licences">Manufacturer licences</h3>

<p>To qualify for a manufacturer licence to make, assemble or import human medicines, you must show the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> that you comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> good manufacturing practice and pass regular inspections of your site.</p>

<h3 id="wholesaler-licences">Wholesaler licences</h3>

<p>To sell or supply medicines to anyone other than the patient using the medicine, you need a wholesaler licence. This is also known as a wholesale dealer licence or wholesale distribution authorisation. To qualify, you must comply with good distribution practice and pass regular inspections of your site.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-supply-issues">Reporting supply issues</h2>

<p>Continue to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reporting-requirements-for-medicine-shortages-and-discontinuations">alert the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s medicine supply team of any supply problems</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>After <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> exit day, if you experience disruption to your supplies or you feel there is potential for disruption and usual procedures can’t resolve the matter, you can report it to National Supply Disruption Response (NSDR). NSDR has been set up to support the management of supply disruption.</p>

<p>Contact details for the NSDR will be shared with suppliers before the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can report the issue to NSDR whether the disruption is related to Brexit or not.</p>
