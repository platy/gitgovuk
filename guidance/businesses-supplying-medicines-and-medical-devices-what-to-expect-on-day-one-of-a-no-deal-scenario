<p>If the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, people should be reassured and have confidence in the government’s plans for continuity of medicines supply.</p>

<p>If you’re a pharmaceutical company supplying the UK with medicines from, or through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) is asking you to make sure you have a minimum of 6 weeks’ additional supply in the UK, over and above your business as usual operational buffer stocks, by 31 October 2019. Read <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s letter to <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/735745/brexit-medicines-letter.pdf">pharmaceutical companies</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has also asked suppliers to indicate how they propose to ensure continuity of supply of their products to the NHS as part of the contingency programme.</p>

<p>Since writing to pharmaceutical companies, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has received good engagement and we know that, as an industry, you share the UK government’s aim of ensuring and maintaining the continued supply of medicines for patients.</p>

<p>If you’re a pharmaceutical company, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will continue to work closely with you to ensure that your UK stockpiles of medicines are sufficient to cope with any potential delays at the border that may arise in the short term.</p>

<h2 id="medical-devices-and-clinical-consumables">Medical devices and clinical consumables</h2>

<p>The UK will continue to recognise medical devices approved for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market – in other words, those that carry a CE mark and, where required, have appropriate certification from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body.</p>

<p>If you are a supplier of medical devices and clinical consumables, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is asking you to continue to review your supply chains and assess the implications of a ‘no deal’ scenario upon your product ranges, and the potential contingencies that might be required. <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/735746/brexit-medical-devices-letter.pdf">Read <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s letter to suppliers of medical devices and clinical consumables</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has adopted a contingency planning approach that will help ensure the continued supply of medical devices and clinical consumables in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario.</p>

<p>As part of that approach, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has undertaken an analysis of supply chains for medical devices and clinical consumables, identifying those products routinely imported into the UK from other countries in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>One of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s contingency measures is to increase stock held at national level, and its NHS Supply Chain colleagues are working with suppliers who import from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to establish the action required to achieve this.</p>

<p>In addition, arrangements are being made to facilitate the continued movement of medical devices and clinical consumables that are routinely supplied from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries directly to NHS organisations. In conjunction with representatives from industry and trade associations, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has set up a working group to test and refine its contingency plans, and the mechanisms by which suppliers will interact with these processes.</p>

<p>Read more about how medicines and medical devices will be regulated in a ‘no deal’ scenario on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-medicines-medical-devices-and-clinical-trials-would-be-regulated-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/how-medicines-medical-devices-and-clinical-trials-would-be-regulated-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2 id="medical-radio-isotopes">Medical radio-isotopes</h2>

<p>The government considers the continuity of supply of medical radio-isotopes to be a high priority matter following UK’s withdrawal from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Euratom. The government’s approach to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/medicines-supply-contingency-planning-programme">medicine supply contingency planning</a> in the event of a ‘no deal’ <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit recognises that there are some products, such as medical radio-isotopes, that have short shelf lives and cannot be stockpiled.</p>

<p>If you’re a supplier of medical radio-isotopes, the government will consider how to support you in making arrangements to avoid any border delays that may arise.</p>

<h2 id="batch-testing-and-clinical-trials">Batch testing and clinical trials</h2>

<p>If the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, we will no longer be a member of the European Medicines Agency (<abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr>). We will continue to recognise batch testing of human medicines carried out in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> states</li>
  <li>third countries with which the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA)</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-in-a-no-deal-scenario/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-on-exit-day#list-of-countries-approved-for-batch-testing"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s list of countries approved for batch testing after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a> for more information.</p>

<p>Before human medicines can be sold or supplied in the UK, we will continue to require a UK-based Qualified Person (<abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr>) to certify the batch testing, and to ensure compliance with the Marketing Authorisation (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>) and Good Manufacturing Practice (<abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr>) guidelines, if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manufactured in the UK</li>
  <li>manufactured in a third country and directly imported into the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>We will continue to recognise certification, release and assurance of compliance with the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> and with <abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr> guidelines, if conducted by a <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> based in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-in-a-no-deal-scenario/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-on-exit-day#approved-country-for-import-list">a listed country</a>, for human medicines that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manufactured in a country on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-in-a-no-deal-scenario/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-on-exit-day#approved-country-for-import-list"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s approved country for import list</a> that have the relevant <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification</li>
  <li>manufactured in a third country, but imported into the UK from a country on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-in-a-no-deal-scenario/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-on-exit-day#approved-country-for-import-list"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s approved country for import list</a>, after <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification in one of these countries</li>
</ul>

<p>This won’t require any further certification.</p>

<p>These arrangements will continue until the government considers any further change is necessary. We are committed to working with industry ahead of any changes to these arrangements that might impact supply chains and manufacturing processes. We’ll give at least 2 years’ notice of the introduction of any changes, to allow industry to fully prepare for their implementation.</p>

<h3 id="investigational-medicinal-products-imps-supplies-for-clinical-trials">Investigational Medicinal Products (<abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr>) supplies for clinical trials</h3>

<p>If you’re an organisation running clinical trials in the UK, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> encourages you to consider your supply chains for Investigational Medicinal Products (<abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr>) – medicines used in medical trials – in the event of a no-deal scenario.</p>

<p>The UK will continue to accept batch testing and <abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr> certification of <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> manufactured in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> states.</p>

<p>There will be no change to the current arrangements for batch testing of <abbr title="Investigational Medicinal Products">IMPs</abbr> manufactured in third countries.</p>

<h2 id="manufacturers-authorisation-licences">Manufacturer’s Authorisation licences</h2>

<p>Currently there are 2 Manufacturer’s Authorisation (<abbr title="Manufacturer’s Authorisation">MIA</abbr>) licences, issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>), that relate to importing licensed medicines into the UK. These are:</p>

<h3 id="manufacturer-licences">Manufacturer licences</h3>

<p>To qualify for a manufacturer licence to make, assemble or import human medicines, you need to show the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> that you comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> good manufacturing practice and pass regular inspections of your site.</p>

<h3 id="wholesaler-licences">Wholesaler licences</h3>

<p>To sell or supply medicines to anyone other than the patient using the medicine, you need a wholesaler licence – also known as a wholesale dealer licence or wholesale distribution authorisation. To qualify, you must comply with good distribution practice and pass regular inspections of your site.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has launched a consultation on the implications of a ‘no deal’ scenario for these licences, as this would mean <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>-based operations would be considered to be within a third country. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has been clear that they will work pragmatically with suppliers to ensure medicines adhere to appropriate regulatory safety standards in a ‘no deal’ scenario.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you’re a pharmaceutical company supplying the UK with medicines from, or via, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), you should make sure you have a minimum of 6 weeks’ additional supply in the UK, over and above your business as usual operational buffer stocks, by 31 October 2019.</li>
