<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<h2 id="HealthcareHungary">Healthcare in Hungary after Brexit</h2>

<p>You should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national visiting or living in Hungary.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Hungary in place.</p>

<p>For example, if you are a current S1 form holder, or a posted worker or a student using a <a href="#EHIC">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a> you will not be able to use these to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-live-in-hungary">If you live in Hungary</h3>

<p>If there is a no-deal Brexit, the Hungarian government has committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from the day the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You can find more information on the <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.kormany.hu/social-benefits-and-social-security-benefits-in-hungary">Hungarian government’s dedicated Brexit website</a>.</p>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-hungary#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Hungary</a></li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Hungary. You can apply for a TAJ kártya (medical insurance card) at the <a rel="external" href="https://kormanyablak.hu/hu">Kormányablak</a>
</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>

<p>Your S1 certificate may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Hungary and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-hungary-after-brexit">Studying in Hungary after Brexit</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Hungary and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Hungary before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK if you are living in Hungary and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>You may use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge when visiting the UK after exit day if you are living in Hungary before exit day and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="EHIC">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Hungary and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Hungary.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need.</p>

<p>If you have any pre-existing conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>Your <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> will be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>
