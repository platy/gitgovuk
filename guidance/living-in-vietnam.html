<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This guide sets out essential information for British nationals moving to, or living in Vietnam, including where to find advice on health, education, benefits, residence requirements, finance, and more. We are unable to provide any guidance on general lifestyle enquiries apart from the information and links listed below. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-hanoi">information on what the Embassy and Consulate-General can and cannot do</a> for British nationals.</p>

<p>Our publication <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad: A guide</a> sets out the steps that British nationals can take to stay safe abroad, and provides details on what help the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) can provide if you do get into difficulty.</p>

<h2>Before you go</h2>

<p>See our travel advice for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/vietnam">Vietnam</a> for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety, and emergencies.
See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>

<p>Please refer to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/vietnam/coronavirus">coronavirus specific travel advice</a> if you are seeking information specific to the current coronavirus pandemic in Vietnam.</p>

<p>We are not advising permanent residents overseas to return to the UK but would remind them that they need to be ready to comply with the local authorities.</p>

<p>British nationals living in Vietnam should consider their own personal circumstances and take into account all of the information available when making a decision on whether or not to return to the UK. You should consider the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Quarantine: You will be required to quarantine if tested positive at any point. Following discharge, you will be expected to undertake a period of self-isolation. Quarantine and self-isolation regulations may vary between provinces and even between districts in major cities. Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/vietnam/coronavirus">Quarantine</a> section of our Travel Advice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Financial support: Do you have sufficient funds to support yourself without going back to the UK for an undetermined number of months?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Health insurance: The costs of quarantine, including testing, in both government centres and designated hotels, must be paid by those arriving or their employers and for any coronavirus hospital treatment costs. Do you have adequate medical insurance coverage? Will it cover you for treatment related to coronavirus? Taking your own personal health condition into account, are you confident in receiving the necessary medical support you need in Vietnam? Check the Healthcare and medication section below for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legal &amp; Employment support: Do you understand the kind of support available to you in the case of unemployment or economic hardship due to coronavirus? Will this support be sufficient for you to support yourself for an undetermined number of months? Check the Employment section below for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visa, Work permit, and Residence card: People holding valid Work permits and Residence cards are able to apply for and may be granted an extension depending on individual circumstances. Those with valid Work permits should work with their employer to have an application submitted and approved. The Vietnamese government has assured us that people who were unable to extend their Visa/Work permit during the period of partial lockdown will not be penalised and can apply without penalty after the lockdown period ends.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the unfortunate event of a death whereby the deceased had COVID-19, the body must be cremated within 24 hours from the time of death. Burial is only allowed where cremation is not available. Cross-border transfer of corpses with COVID-19 is not permitted. These policies are to prevent the virus’ transmission.</p>

<p>The Embassy and Consulate-General will not be able to assist with individual Visitor visa extensions should you wish to stay in Vietnam, nor sponsor individual applications or sign NA5 forms (which has the same effect) as this involves legal and financial obligations. For those with a valid Work permit or Resident card, you can extend these at the Immigration office with the assistance and support of your family or employer.</p>

<h2>What you should do</h2>

<h3>Stay up to date</h3>
<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sign up for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/vietnam/email-signup">email alerts</a> to this guidance</li>
  <li>follow the UK in Vietnam on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/ukinvietnam" rel="external">Facebook</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Entry and residency requirements</h3>

<p>Please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/vi/gioi-thieu/li%C3%AAn-h%E1%BB%87" rel="external">local Immigration Department website</a> for further information and contact details of your nearest office if you wish to settle, visit, or work in Vietnam. You may find the Vietnamese language page has more up-to-date information than the English version. Due to the high volume of enquiries, it may take some time to reach the relevant authorities.</p>

<p>Visitor visas are issued to foreigners for a limited duration and on the basis that visitors must leave on or before the date of expiry. Those who come to Vietnam to work are required to apply for a Work permit. You should check the visa validity and conditions carefully. Overstaying your Visitor visa is a serious matter and you may be delayed from travel until a fine is paid, and may be prevented from visiting Vietnam again in the future.</p>

<p>If you want to stay in Vietnam, you must do so legally and with the right visa. Direct your visa-related enquiries to the nearest Immigration office.</p>

<p>We are aware that some foreigners have been using visa companies to submit visa applications to extend their stay in Vietnam without leaving the country. The UK government cannot control the rates charged by commercial companies. Neither are we able to recommend specific companies.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese government has temporarily suspended visa waivers, issuing of visas, and the entry into Vietnam for all foreigners. There are a very small number of exceptions for diplomats on official business and certain high-skilled workers. These will be processed on case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>You cannot leave Vietnam without a valid visa.</p>

<p>If you wish to sponsor visa for family members/dependants you should contact the nearest Immigration office for instruction.</p>

<h3>Healthcare and medication</h3>

<p>Visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/vietnam/health">Health section</a> of our Travel Advice for detailed advice on medical services, vaccinations, and health risks in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Standard of health care in public hospitals is different from in the UK. If you wish to receive the same health care standard as in the UK, you should consider using private hospitals.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-vietnam">list of medical facilities in Vietnam</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Medicine</h3>

<p>If you are on a prescription for any form of medication, you should ensure you have a supply of it available, or are able to obtain it once in Vietnam. Certain medicines may not be available in Vietnam (including major brands readily available in the UK), and may be prohibited from entering the country. You should consult your GP before travelling to Vietnam to learn of any alternatives which may be available.</p>

<h3>Health insurance</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Vietnam ensure you have taken out an appropriate health insurance policy.</p>

<p>If you are a visitor, arrange comprehensive travel insurance before you travel. Make sure your policy covers the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An air ambulance, in case you need to be flown home by this means;</li>
  <li>Full medical cover (medical bills can be expensive);</li>
  <li>Repatriation of your remains in the event of death; and</li>
  <li>Repatriation of your family in the event it is necessary for you to return home due to illness or injury</li>
</ul>

<h3>Working in Vietnam</h3>

<p>If you want to work in Vietnam you must have a valid work permit. For more information speak to your employer who will apply the work permit on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you have degree certificates, professional qualifications, job references, and police checks you must legalise them before they can be accepted by Vietnamese authorities. For information on how to get your documents legalised for use in Vietnam see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/667699/2017-10-18_Legalisation_of_signatures_and_official_stamps.pdf" rel="external">legalisation of signatures and official stamps</a>.</p>

<h3>Money and Banking</h3>

<p>The official currency of Vietnam is Vietnamese Đồng (VND). Cash is accepted universally.</p>

<p>Credit cards e.g. Visa, Master Card, JCB, and American Express are accepted in many restaurants, hotels, and shops in Vietnam’s big cities.</p>

<p>If you wish to transfer money out of Vietnam, you must use money transfer services e.g. PayPal, MoneyGram, or Western Union. You cannot transfer money internationally from your Vietnamese bank account unless the recipient is a member of your family.</p>

<p>You must have a valid local driving licence or international driving permit to ride a motorbike or drive a car in Vietnam. For more information, contact the nearest Transportation Office.</p>

<p>If you’re asked for a letter authenticating, certifying, or validating your UK driver’s licence, you should contact your UK issuing office e.g. the DVLA.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Language, social ethics and traditions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Language: Vietnamese is the first language of the majority of the Vietnamese population, as well as a first or second language for the country’s ethnic minority groups.</li>
  <li>Religion: Ancestor worship is the most popular belief amongst the Vietnamese people. Of the major world religions, Buddhism is prevalent followed by Catholicism. Atheism and Animism are also widespread.</li>
  <li>Attitudes (and legal position) towards LGBT: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people are generally tolerated in Vietnam, especially in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City where there is a larger LGBT community. The Law on Marriage and Family 2014 came into effect in January 2015 provided some rights to same sex couples and allow same-sex marriage. Although it allows same-sex weddings, such couples are neither recognised nor protected under the law for matters such as persona and property rights.</li>
  <li>Local expatriate groups and online fora: There are different local expat groups online and offline in Vietnam in cities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accommodation and buying property</h3>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-buying-property-abroad">buying a property abroad</a>.</p>

<p>With the effectiveness of the Vietnamese Law on Residential Housing in 2015, foreigners can purchase as many property units as they desire and there is no limitation on the total purchase of property units. Nonetheless, there are some restrictions. The number of property units in one administrative ward a foreigner can own is limited. A foreigner can only purchase a maximum of 30% units of the condominiums and are not allowed to own more than 10% properties of a landed project.</p>

<p>Foreigners are not allowed to purchase land in Vietnam. They are allowed to use and control the land they lease with a leasehold period of up to 50-70 years. The leasehold period if renewable.</p>

<p>Freehold ownership is not permitted for foreigners unless a foreigner is married to a Vietnamese national.</p>

<h3>Leaving Vietnam</h3>

<p>If you have not made full National Insurance (NI) contributions, remember you may not be eligible for state benefits or support. HM Revenue &amp; Customs provide some useful information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">returning to live in the UK for non-residents</a>, including how to make NI contributions from abroad. If you reside in Vietnam and would like to apply for a criminal record check, please contact the local Justice Office (Hanoi: +84 024 3354 6163, Ho Chi Minh City: +84 028 3829 0230) and they can issue a “Judicial Record”. This record is normally only issued to foreigners residing in Vietnam but not to the short-term visitors. The Embassy and Consulate-General cannot help you to obtain this certificate. You may need to ask your Vietnamese employer or hire a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vietnam-list-of-english-speaking-lawyers-for-british-nationals/vietnam-list-of-english-speaking-lawyers">local lawyer</a> to make enquiry about this process. Also, we don’t provide a biometric test at post for birth registration.</p>

<p>To move your pension to the UK, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension Centre</a>.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-return-uk">tax if you return to the UK</a>.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad">bringing your pet to the UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Returning to the UK</h3>

<p>If you live in Vietnam and are considering returning to live in the UK (for example on retirement) you should consider how you will support yourself, and how non-British members of your family may be able to accompany you. There is information available to help you make informed choices about living abroad and thinking about returning to the UK.</p>

<h4>National Insurance (NI)</h4>

<p>If you have not made full NI contributions, you may not be eligible for state benefits or support. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/volcontr/abroad.htm" rel="external">HM Revenue &amp; Customs</a> provide some useful information on returning to live in the UK for non-residents, including how to make NI contributions from abroad.</p>

<h4>Healthcare</h4>

<p>Your entitlement to free NHS treatment depends on length and purpose of your residence in the UK, not your nationality. You must be able to show UK residency to be eligible for free treatment, even if you are a British citizen. The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" rel="external">Citizen’s Advice Bureau</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx" rel="external">NHS</a> can provide further information.</p>

<h4>Visas</h4>
<p>If you wish to return to live in the UK with family members who do not hold British citizenship, they will need to meet the UK’s immigration requirements for settlement in the UK. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration">UK Visa and Immigration</a> page for more details.</p>
