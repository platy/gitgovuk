<p>The UK government has imposed a range of sanctions measures, including trade and financial sanctions, under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855" rel="external">The Russia (Sanctions) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019</a> (“the Russia Sanctions Regulations”).</p>

<p>The purposes of the Russia Sanctions Regulations are to encourage Russia to cease actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>destabilising Ukraine, or</li>
  <li>undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine</li>
</ul>

<p>Find detailed guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sanctions-on-russia">UK sanctions relating to Russia</a>.</p>

<p>UK businesses are responsible for the decision on whether to trade with Russia.</p>

<p>Business should expect a high unpredictable trading environment as a result of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>designations of individuals and entities under the Russia Sanctions Regulations by the UK</li>
  <li>retaliatory measures by Russia</li>
</ul>

<p>The Russia Sanctions Regulations affects several aspects of trade with Russia, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the movement of goods to and from Russia</li>
  <li>the settling of financial transactions with suppliers and customers</li>
  <li>trading with certain businesses and individuals</li>
</ul>

<p>Businesses should seek legal advice if they plan to continue trading with Russia.</p>

<h2>Trade sanctions</h2>

<p>The following sections provide an outline of the key restrictions and exemptions, which should be read alongside <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sanctions-on-russia">other guidance on UK sanctions relating to Russia</a>.</p>

<h3>Sanctions applicability</h3>

<p>UK trade sanctions apply to all persons within the territory and territorial sea of the UK and to all UK persons, wherever they are in the world.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all individuals and legal entities who are within, or undertake activities within, the UK’s territory must comply with UK financial sanctions that are in force</li>
  <li>all UK nationals and legal entities established under UK law, including their branches, must also comply with UK financial sanctions that are in force, irrespective of where their activities take place</li>
</ul>

<p>Breaches of sanctions measures under the Russia Sanctions Regulations is a criminal offence.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> sanctions regulations also apply where they relate to trade in goods between the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and third countries.</p>

<p>The regulation defines “third country” as a country that is not the UK, the Isle of Man or Russia.</p>

<p>All UK sanctions apply in Northern Ireland. <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> sanctions regulations also apply where they relate to trade in goods between the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and third countries as stipulated by Annex 2 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, in which traders in Northern Ireland must adhere to:</p>

<p>“Restrictive measures in force based on Article 215 TFEU, insofar as they relate to trade in goods between the Union and third countries.”</p>

<h3>Trade sanctions in the Russia Sanctions Regulations</h3>

<p>Trade sanctions are set out in Part 5 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855" rel="external">The Russia (Sanctions) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019</a> (“the Regulations”).</p>

<p>Check the Regulations for information on prohibited commodities, products and services.</p>

<p>The Regulations set out the restrictions currently imposed, while the schedules provide definitions of the prohibited goods.</p>

<p>Example: If Chapter 5 of Part 5 sets out the prohibitions for the exporting of infrastructure-related goods to non-government controlled Ukrainian territory, you will need to refer to its relevant schedule (Part 3, Schedule 3) for the definitions of the goods.</p>

<p>The Regulations also cover a range of other items such as transfer of technology, providing technical assistance, brokering services and financial services.</p>

<p>For further guidance, check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russia-sanctions-guidance/russia-sanctions-guidance">statutory guidance on sanctions against Russia</a>.</p>

<h3>Trading via a third country</h3>

<p>Current prohibitions apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exports of certain goods or technology to Russia or to non-government controlled Ukrainian territory</li>
  <li>exports of certain goods or technology that are for use in Russia or to non-government controlled Ukrainian territory</li>
  <li>supply and delivery of certain goods or technology from a third country to Russia or to non-government controlled Ukrainian territory or from Russia to a third country</li>
  <li>transfer of certain technology to Russia or a person connected with Russia or transfer from Russia to persons or place outside the UK</li>
  <li>making certain goods or technology available for use in Russia or to a person connected with Russia or use in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory or to a person connected with non-government controlled Ukrainian territory</li>
  <li>acquiring certain goods or technology which originate in Russia or which are located in Russia or from a person connected with Russia</li>
  <li>providing technical assistance, brokering services or financial services and funds related to certain specified goods or technology for use in Russia, or person connected with Russia, or for use in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory or to persons connected with non-government controlled Ukrainian territory</li>

  <li>imports that are consigned from Russia</li>
  <li>imports that originated in Russia</li>
</ul>

<p>For exports, this means that the prohibition may apply even if the immediate destination is not Russia.</p>

<p>There are import prohibitions on certain goods that have originated from Russia and all goods from non-government controlled Ukrainian territory. These prohibitions are applicable even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from was not from Russia or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.</p>

<p>See “Import Restrictions” below for more information.</p>

<p>For both exports and imports, the same applies to goods or services to and originating from Ukrainian territory that is not controlled by Ukraine’s government.</p>

<p>‘Non-government controlled Ukrainian territory’ is defined in the Regulations as ‘Crimea and non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts’.</p>

<h3>Exceptions to trade sanctions</h3>

<p>The Regulations set out exceptions to some of the trade restrictions which apply within certain defined circumstances. These are set out in Part 7 of the Regulations. An exception applies automatically, and does not require you to obtain a licence issued in accordance with the Regulations.</p>

<p>Licences may also be issued for certain trade activities that would otherwise be prohibited by the Regulations. Circumstances for which a licence may be granted for certain trade activities are listed in Section 3.3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russia-sanctions-guidance/russia-sanctions-guidance">Russia sanctions guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, there may be a case for licence applications to be granted under ‘prior obligation’ grounds if goods or services have already been provided.</p>

<p>Under prior obligation grounds, the obligation must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have arisen before the designation date</li>
  <li>not relate to trade provisions (specified in the Regulations)</li>
  <li>not result in funds or economic resources being made available (directly or indirectly) to the designated person</li>
</ul>

<p>A licence may also be granted for goods, technology or services required for the delivery of humanitarian assistance activity.</p>

<p>Apply for trade sanctions licences through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login" rel="external">SPIRE, the online export licensing system</a>.</p>

<h2>Export control licensing</h2>

<p>Exporters should check the ultimate end-use of goods. You should apply for a licence via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login" rel="external">SPIRE</a> or contact the Export Control Joint Unit (<abbr title="The Export Control Joint Unit">ECJU</abbr>) if you know or think the items may be used in Russia or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.</p>

<p>Refer and subscribe to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notices-to-exporters">notices to exporters</a> for the latest export controls relating to Russia and non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.</p>

<p>Go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/21" rel="external">regulation 21</a> of the Regulations on legislation.gov.uk for definitions on controlled goods.</p>

<h2>Import control licensing</h2>

<p>Importers should check the original place goods were consigned from. You should apply for a licence or contact the Import Licensing Branch if you think the items may have originated in or have been consigned from Russia or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.</p>

<p>Refer and subscribe to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-to-importers-2953-russia-import-sanctions">notice to importers</a> for the latest import controls relating to Russia, which should be read alongside the statutory guidance.</p>

<p>Where traders are looking to import prohibited goods, and where an exception does not apply, you will need to make a licence application through ILB’s&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ilb.trade.gov.uk/icms/fox/live/IMP_LOGIN/login" rel="external">Import Case Management System (<abbr title="Import Case Management System">ICMS</abbr>)</a>. You will need to register on <abbr title="Import Case Management System">ICMS</abbr>, if you do not already have an account, and submit an importer access request.</p>

<p>Please then contact&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:importcontrols@trade.gov.uk">importcontrols@trade.gov.uk</a>&nbsp;with details of your proposed import for further instruction. We will then consider each application on a case-by-case basis to determine whether granting a licence would be consistent with the stated purposes of the sanctions regime and any&nbsp;UN&nbsp;or other relevant international law obligations.</p>

<p>For further instructions, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:importcontrols@trade.gov.uk">importcontrols@trade.gov.uk</a> in the first instance, with details of your proposed import.</p>

<h2>Tariffs on Russian and Belarusian goods</h2>

<p>The UK has increased import tariffs by 35% percent on a number of goods from Russia and Belarus. The 35% additional duty will apply on top of existing tariff measures. The tariff increase applies to goods originating in Russia and Belarus.</p>

<p>Products affected are those that are important to the Russian economy and include iconic Russian goods such as vodka and fur skin clothing.</p>

<p>The tariffs on Belarus are in line with the evolving sanctions positions, and will prevent the circumvention of Russian-origin goods.</p>

<p>The government will continue to keep these tariffs under review as the situation in Ukraine develops.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reference-documents-for-customs-additional-duty-russia-and-belarus-regulations-2022">Reference Documents for Customs (Additional Duty) (Russia and Belarus) Regulations 2022</a> to find out what additional duties apply on certain goods originating from Russia and Belarus. The document contains commodities codes.</p>

<h3>Rules of origin</h3>

<p>The origin of goods is based on where they have been grown, produced, or manufactured, and may not be the country where they have been shipped or brought from.</p>

<p>Use the guidance to determine the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-goods-meet-the-rules-of-origin">country of origin of goods</a>.</p>

<p>Goods originating in other countries and then shipped through Russia and Belarus will not receive a higher tariff.</p>

<h2>Financial sanctions</h2>

<p>The regulations impose financial sanctions on designated persons.</p>

<p>Financial sanctions are specific to each designated person. However, in general, they comprehend a prohibition on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dealing with funds or economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles) owned, held or controlled by a designated person</li>
  <li>making funds and economic resources available to or for the benefit of a designated person, either directly or indirectly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applicability</h3>

<p>You should ensure that you consider the above financial sanctions. This might impact your ability to get paid.</p>

<p>UK financial sanctions apply to all persons within the territory and territorial sea of the UK and to all UK persons, wherever they are in the world.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all individuals and legal entities who are within, or undertake activities within, the UK’s territory must comply with UK financial sanctions that are in force</li>
  <li>all UK nationals and legal entities established under UK law, including their branches, must also comply with UK financial sanctions that are in force, irrespective of where their activities take place</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exceptions to financial sanctions</h3>

<p>There are certain exceptions that apply to financial payments under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russia-sanctions-guidance">Russia (Sanctions) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019</a>. This are listed in the regulations and also detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1065259/Russia_guidance_31.03.22.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation">OFSI</abbr>’s Russia guidance</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation">OFSI</abbr> has issued <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsi-general-licences">several general licences</a> under the Russia regulations that allow multiple parties to undertake an activity that would otherwise be prohibited.</p>

<p>For other activities, you may be able <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licences-that-allow-activity-prohibited-by-financial-sanctions">to apply for a specific licence</a> from <abbr title="The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation">OFSI</abbr> under certain conditions. Please note that you may need a licence from <abbr title="The Export Control Joint Unit">ECJU</abbr> as well as a licence from <abbr title="The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation">OFSI</abbr> in some circumstances.</p>

<h2>Getting paid</h2>

<p>You will need to check first whether your Russian agents, partners or suppliers are subject to current financial sanctions. Even if they are not, current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trading-under-sanctions-with-russia#financial-sanctions">financial sanctions</a> could impact your ability to make or receive payment via a Russian bank should they be subject to any financial sanctions.</p>

<p>As a part of your financial sanctions due diligence when importing or exporting, you should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who and where the goods or services are coming from or going to (it is possible that financial sanctions such as an asset freeze may apply to one of the parties or to the financial aspects of the trade)</li>
  <li>who is shipping the goods, and whether they are being shipped on a sanctioned vessel</li>
  <li>whether a designated person is based in a different country to the one you are operating in, but is still subject to financial sanctions in that country</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider if individuals or organisations are ‘owned’ or ‘controlled’ either directly or indirectly by designated persons.</p>

<p>The financial measures extend to entities, owned or controlled by designated persons within the meaning of regulation 7 of the Russia Sanctions Regulation unless specific activities are covered by an exception or General Licence; or if a licence is granted under the usual process.</p>
