<p>The following legal obligations apply to holders of UK marketing authorisations (MA). These include those that cover the whole of the UK, or are specific to Northern Ireland or to Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), including Great Britain <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> granted to allow unfettered access from Northern Ireland.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To operate a pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products</li>
  <li>To have an appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance (<abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>) that resides and operates anywhere in the UK or in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products</li>
  <li>To maintain and make available upon request a pharmacovigilance system master file (<abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr>) that describes the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products. The <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> must be accessible electronically from the UK at the same site at which reports of suspected adverse reactions may be accessed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidance on the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> for UK authorised products</h2>
<p>For all UK <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr>, including those that cover the whole of the UK or are specific to Northern Ireland or to Great Britain, the marketing authorisation holder (<abbr title="marketing authorisation holder">MAH</abbr>) must have permanently and continuously at its disposal a <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> who resides and operates anywhere in the UK or in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, and is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the pharmacovigilance system (“the UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>”). Where the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> is not in the UK, there will be a need for a national contact person for pharmacovigilance as set out below.</p>

<p>This is provided for by regulation 182 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (<abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr>).</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that cover the whole of the UK or are specific to Northern Ireland, the legal requirements concerning the qualifications and responsibilities of the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> that are outlined in Article 10 of the Commission Implementing Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 520/2012 (CIR) will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that are specific to Great Britain, legal requirements concerning the qualifications and responsibilities of the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> are outlined in paragraph 10 of <abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr> Schedule 12A (inserted by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit Regulations 2019), which mirrors Article 10 of CIR.</p>

<p>Statutory guidance concerning the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> for UK authorised products is described in the Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (<abbr title="Good Pharmacovigilance Practice">GVP</abbr>) Module I. This guidance is supplemented by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exceptions-and-modifications-to-the-eu-guidance-on-good-pharmacovigilance-practices-that-will-apply-to-uk-mahs-and-the-mhra" class="govuk-link">Exceptions and modifications to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> guidance on good pharmacovigilance practices that apply to UK marketing authorisation holders</a>.</p>

<p>There is no temporary exemption as to the requirement to have a <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> who resides and operates in the UK or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and is responsible for the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products.</p>

<h3>National contact person for pharmacovigilance</h3>
<p>If you choose to establish a <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> who resides and operates in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, you must nominate a national contact person for pharmacovigilance who resides and operates in the UK and reports to the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>. This individual should have access to the reports of suspected adverse reactions referred to in regulation 187 of the HMRs and the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> for UK authorised products. The individual should be able to facilitate responses to pharmacovigilance queries raised by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, including via inspections.</p>

<p>There will be a temporary exemption in place which allows you 12 months from 1 January 2021 to appoint a national contact person for pharmacovigilance that resides and operates in the UK.</p>

<p>Once the national contact person for pharmacovigilance has been appointed, their details should be notified to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> via the <a rel="external" href="https://mhrabpm.appiancloud.com/suite/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Submissions Portal</a>. You should follow the instructions for submitting these details. You should receive a confirmation by email immediately upon completion of the form.</p>

<p>There is no requirement to appoint a deputy for the UK national contact person for pharmacovigilance, but for periods of extended absence greater than one month (such as maternity leave, long-term sick leave, etc.), it is expected that another individual is assigned as the national contact person for pharmacovigilance and their details should be notified to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> within two weeks of the change. In practice, this means editing the existing details of the national contact person for pharmacovigilance that are saved in the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Submissions portal.</p>

<h2>Guidance on the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> for UK authorised products</h2>
<p>For all UK national <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr>, including those that cover the whole of the UK or are specific to Northern Ireland or to Great Britain, the <abbr title="marketing authorisation holder">MAH</abbr> must maintain, and make available upon request of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, a <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> that describes the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products (‘the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr>’).</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> accessibility in the UK</h3>
<p>All UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master files">PSMFs</abbr> must be accessible electronically at the same point in the UK from which the reports of suspected adverse reactions referred to in regulation 187 of the HMRs are accessible. This requirement applies from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> needs to be permanently and immediately available for inspection at the stated location in the UK.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> format, content and representation of pharmacovigilance systems</h3>
<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that cover the whole of the UK or are specific to Northern Ireland, the legal requirements concerning the format and content of the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> that are outlined in Chapter I of CIR will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that are specific to Great Britain, legal requirements concerning the format and content of the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> are outlined in Part 1 of Schedule 12A of <abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr>, which mirrors Chapter I of CIR.</p>

<p>As the legal requirements concerning <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> format and content are identical for <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that cover the whole of the UK and Northern Ireland, and those that are specific to Great Britain, a single UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> can be used for all UK authorised products. This is assuming that the pharmacovigilance system applied to all products is the same.</p>

<p>Statutory guidance concerning the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> for UK authorised products is described in <abbr title="Good Pharmacovigilance Practice">GVP</abbr> Module II. This guidance is supplemented by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exceptions-and-modifications-to-the-eu-guidance-on-good-pharmacovigilance-practices-that-will-apply-to-uk-mahs-and-the-mhra-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Exceptions and modifications to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> guidance on good pharmacovigilance practices that apply to UK marketing authorisation holders</a>.</p>

<p>The UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> must describe the global pharmacovigilance system and reflect the global availability of safety information for UK authorised products.</p>

<p>As per <abbr title="Good Pharmacovigilance Practice">GVP</abbr> Module II, there are different approaches to establishing a pharmacovigilance system. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr> can establish more than one pharmacovigilance system</li>
  <li>A pharmacovigilance system can be shared by several <abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> should be an accurate representation of the pharmacovigilance system that has been established and you must make sure that every pharmacovigilance system covering UK authorised products has been assigned a unique <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>How to request a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number</h3>
<p>All <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master files">PSMFs</abbr> that cover UK authorised products should be registered with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. You should request a unique UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> for each pharmacovigilance system that you are operating for UK authorised products. Where the pharmacovigilance system is shared by several <abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr>, a single request for a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>A UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number can be requested via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mhrabpm.appiancloud.com/suite/" rel="external"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Submissions Portal</a>. You should follow the online instructions for requesting a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number and you should receive the number by email immediately upon completion of the form. The address from which the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> can be electronically accessed must be in the UK. Your UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number will be invalidated if the address provided is not in the UK. Any submissions to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> using an invalidated UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number will not be accepted.</p>

<p>The UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number will be sent to the UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> email address as well as the email address you nominated on the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number request form. If you have not received a confirmation email within three hours of submitting the form, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:submissions@mhra.gov.uk">submissions@mhra.gov.uk</a>. Please do not re-submit the form as this will cause delays in processing your request.</p>

<p>Once a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number is assigned to a pharmacovigilance system it should remain unchanged, irrespective of how the system may change and evolve over time. You should not request a new UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number if there are changes to the pharmacovigilance system, including a change of UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>.</p>

<p>You do not need to update the initial information that was provided in the online form at the time of requesting your UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number (e.g. <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> telephone number, <abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr> covered by the pharmacovigilance system, etc.). This information is solely for the purpose of generating and allocating a unique UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number at a specific point in time. You must maintain the pharmacovigilance system information for your UK licences via the submission of the appropriate variations to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-on-qualified-person-responsible-for-pharmacovigilance-qppv-including-pharmacovigilance-system-master-files-psmf#notification-of-qppv-and-psmf-details-to-the-mhra-by-existing-holders-of-uk-marketing-authorisations" class="govuk-link">Guidance on this process is provided below.</a></p>

<h2>Guidance for applicants for UK marketing authorisations</h2>
<p>The material to accompany an application for a UK marketing authorisation includes a summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system (<abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr>).</p>

<p>This must include the following elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>proof that the applicant has at their disposal an appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance who resides and operates in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or the UK,</li>
  <li>the country (which must be either the UK or a Member State) in which the appropriately qualified person resides and carries out his or her tasks</li>
  <li>the contact details of the appropriately qualified person</li>
  <li>a statement signed by the applicant which says that they have the necessary means to fulfil the tasks and responsibilities listed in Part 11</li>
  <li>a reference to the location where the pharmacovigilance system master file for the medicinal product can be accessed electronically, which must be in the UK</li>
</ol>

<p>The <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> should also include the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number.</p>

<p>The above is following <abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr> Schedule 8.</p>

<p>Guidance on the application process and on registering to make submissions via the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Submissions Portal is available.</p>

<p>You should use Agency Activity Reference ID: G0001 – Initial Marketing Authorisation Application and Subactivity Text: H002 – “Original Submission”.</p>

<p>Information on the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> and <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> for UK authorised products should be entered in section 2.4.4 of the electronic application form (<abbr title="electronic application form">eAF</abbr>). You should note the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> for UK authorised products resides and operates in the UK, the checkbox entitled “The above-mentioned qualified person resides and operates in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>” can remain unchecked.</li>
  <li>the UK location where the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> can be accessed from does not need to be registered in the Article 57 database, therefore the associated checkbox can remain unchecked.</li>
</ul>

<p>For UK licence applications via mutual recognition or decentralised procedures, the UK <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> should be included in module 1.8.1 as a standalone file or alternatively under a UK subfolder.</p>

<h2>Notification of <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> and <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> details to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> by existing holders of UK marketing authorisations</h2>
<p>You should submit Type IAIN variations related to the <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and these submissions should cover all UK product licences (<abbr title="product license">PL</abbr>) under a unique pharmacovigilance system.</p>

<h3>How to make your submission</h3>
<p>All applications to update the <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> are required to be submitted as a Type IAIN - C.I.8 variation via the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Submissions Portal. You should use Agency Activity Reference ID: G0098 – Variation Type IA - Establishing UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>-<abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> and Subactivity Text: H002 – “Original Submission”. For UK licences issued via mutual recognition or decentralised procedures, a variation to update the UK <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> should be submitted as a UK-only National procedure and the <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> should be included in module 1.8.1 as a standalone file or alternatively under a UK subfolder. Please refer to the <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957633/Overview_of_managing_updates.pdf">Overview of managing updates</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">95.8 KB</span>, <span lang="en" class="page-length">1 page</span>)</span> to the <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> for UK licences issued via mutual recognition or decentralised procedures.</p>

<p>We are expecting a large volume of regulatory submissions. You should submit your <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> updates as single changes and, to prevent delays, you should submit in collections of no more than 25 <abbr title="product license">PLs</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should submit no more than two collections in a single package or within a single week without prior notification.</p>

Please include reference ‘PSMFT1’ in the email subject line.</p>

<h3>Documentation you need to supply</h3>
<p>You should supply the following documentation in a C.I.8 submission (Introduction of, or changes to, a summary of pharmacovigilance system for medical products for human use):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proof that the applicant has at their disposal a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and a statement signed by the applicant to the effect that the applicant has the necessary means to fulfil the tasks and responsibilities listed in Part 11</li>
  <li>The country (which must be either the UK or a Member State) in which the appropriately qualified person resides and carries out their tasks</li>
  <li>Contact details of the appropriately qualified person who resides and operates in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or the UK</li>
  <li>A reference to the location where the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> for the medicinal product can be accessed, which must be in the UK</li>
  <li>UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number</li>
</ul>

<p>Failing to supply all required documentation and information may lead to a rejection of the submission, which will require you to make a resubmission addressing all discrepancies.</p>

<p>The requirements for various categories of variations are outlined in the guidelines published by the Commission under Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.</p>

<h4>Submission timeframes</h4>
<p>You must notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of the details in the <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> following any changes to the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> responsible for UK authorised products from the baseline information held by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. The baseline information is the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> details that were registered in eXtended EudraVigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary (<abbr title="eXtended Eudravigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary">XEVMPD</abbr>) at the end of 13 December 2020. For any <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> updates submitted prior to 13 December 2020, you should have received a successful acknowledgement message (coded as ‘01’) indicating that the information in the XEVPRM has been processed successfully. This is because the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>  compiled the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> details for UK authorised products that were in <abbr title="eXtended Eudravigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary">XEVMPD</abbr> as of 14 December 2020. Changes made after 13 December 2020 will not be included in the baseline dataset.</p>

<p>The submission of <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> details for licences that were authorised via the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> centralised procedure should be handled differently to UK national licences. Please refer to the <span class="attachment-inline"><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957632/Submission_Timeframes_Overview_v6.pdf" class="govuk-link">Submission timeframe overview</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">12.3 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">1 page</span>)</span> which has an overview of the timeframes for submitting <abbr title="summary of the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system">SPS</abbr> details to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.

<p>Within two weeks of a change of identity, location or contact details of the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> responsible for UK authorised products, you should submit a single change Type IAIN - C.I.8 variation. This should cover all UK <abbr title="product license">PLs</abbr> under a unique pharmacovigilance system (in collections of no more than 25 <abbr title="product license">PLs</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you anticipate no changes to the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> details from those entered in <abbr title="eXtended Eudravigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary">XEVMPD</abbr> by 30 June 2022, then these details for the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>, together with the UK location that the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> can be accessed from and UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number, should be submitted as a single change Type IAIN - C.I.8 variation by this deadline.</p>

<h4>Licences authorised via the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> centralised procedure</h4>
<p>All existing <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> authorised through the centrally authorised procedure will automatically be converted into UK <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr>.

<p>You will have a period of one year, starting on 1 January 2021, to submit the baseline initiating sequence data and related information in eCTD format.</p>

<p>At the point of submission of the baseline initiating eCTD sequence you should follow the following guidance:</p>

This variation will be processed once the baseline sequence is processed.</p>

  <li>If you anticipate no changes to the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> details from those entered on <abbr title="eXtended Eudravigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary">XEVMPD</abbr> by 30 June 2022, then the details of the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> and <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> should be submitted by this deadline.</li>
