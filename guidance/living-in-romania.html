<h3>Residency</h3>

<p>If you were resident in Romania before 1 January 2021, you need to apply for a new residency card to secure your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. This includes students and family members of UK nationals.</p>

<p>You must apply for the residency card in person at your local Immigration Inspectorate office before 31 December 2021. The card is free of charge. The supporting documents you must provide depend on how long you have lived in Romania.</p>

<p>Read the Romanian government’s <a href="http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en/content/entry-romania" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on the residency registration process for non-EU family members</a></p>

<h3>Apply for a new residency card if you have lived in Romania for less than 5 years</h3>

<p>If you are registered as a temporary resident or have not registered previously, you need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your completed application form</li>
  <li>your UK passport, and a copy of it</li>
  <li>proof of valid healthcare cover</li>
  <li>proof of your address</li>
  <li>proof of your means of income or financial support to the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1126&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=4756">value of the minimum guaranteed income in Romania</a> eg. bank statement, payslip, pension slip</li>

<p>You will be eligible for permanent residency when you have lived in Romania for 5 continuous years.</p>

<h3>Apply for a new residency card if you have lived in Romania for more than 5 years</h3>

<p>If you have lived in Romania for more than 5 years and are registered as a permanent resident, you need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your completed application form</li>
  <li>your UK passport and a copy of it</li>
  <li>a criminal record police check issued by your local police station</li>
  <li>proof of your address</li>
</ul>

<p>Your new residency card will be valid for 10 years and will be renewable.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must <a href="http://www.cnas.ro/default/index/index/lang/EN" rel="external" class="govuk-link">register for healthcare</a> as a resident in Romania.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-romania" class="govuk-link">healthcare in Romania</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Romania temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-romania#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Romania 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>receiving a UK State Pension</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a frontier worker who lives in Romania and commutes to work in the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-romania#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on using an S1 form in Romania</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Romania, you must not use a UK-issued EHIC to access healthcare in Romania.</p>

<p>If you were living in Romania before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a UK student in Romania</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a frontier worker with a registered S1</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" rel="external">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a></p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Romania.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Romania, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180 day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Working in Romania</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Romania before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>If you intend to work in Romania, you must register with the Romanian Office for Immigrants. You can also register as self-employed. The <a rel="external" href="http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en/content/registered-residence" class="govuk-link">General Inspectorate for Immigration</a> has more information.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Romanian criminal records certificate (Cazier Judiciar)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK police certificate</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Romania and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country, before 1 January 2021, you will need a permit to prove you are a frontier worker.</p>

<p>If you live in the UK or another EU or EFTA country and regularly commuted to work in Romania before 1 January 2021 you need a permit. You must apply for the permit at the immigration office where you work.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.mai.gov.ro/cetatenii-britanici-in-context-brexit/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Romanian government’s guidance for UK nationals</a> which includes information for frontier workers.</p>

<h2>Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Romanian nationals, as long as you were legally resident in Romania before 1 January 2021. You must apply for a residence permit in Romania.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to Romania to study</h3>

<p>If you are planning to study in Romania, make sure you meet all visa requirements before you arrive. Contact the relevant Higher Education provider in Romania to check what fees you have to pay.</p>

<p>For more information read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-european-union-after-brexit" class="govuk-link">studying in the European Union.</a></p>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>You may need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in Romania. When doing this, you will be subject to the third country regulations.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://cnred.edu.ro/en">Romanian government’s guidance on how to get your professional qualifications recognised.</a></p>

<p>If your qualification was officially recognised by the relevant regulator in Romania before 1 January 2021, make sure you understand the terms of your recognition decision by checking with that regulator.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>
