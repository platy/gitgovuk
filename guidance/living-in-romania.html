<h2>If you were living in Romania before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Romania since before 1 January 2021.  You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Romanian government and your local authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/romania">Romania travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Romania read  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/romania/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/romania/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Romania</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Romania before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you applied for your new â€˜permis de È™edereâ€™ residence card by 31 December 2021, your rights are protected by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> pending a decision on your application. You should continue the process to get your new residence card if you do not have it yet.</p>

<p>You must renew your permis de È™edere when it expires. The renewal process is the same as when you first applied. Read the <a href="https://www.mai.gov.ro/en/british-citizens-in-the-context-of-brexit/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Romanian government guidance for â€˜permanent residence in Romaniaâ€™</a>.</p>

<p>If you have not had a response to your permis de È™edere application, <a href="http://igi.mai.gov.ro/ro/node/contact" class="govuk-link" rel="external">contact your local immigration office</a>.</p>

<h3>Late applications</h3>

<p>The deadline for applying for a new residence status, the permis de È™edere, was 31 December 2021.</p>

<p>You can still apply if you have reasonable grounds for missing it. However, you may be fined for a late application or receive an official letter of warning from the Romanian authorities.</p>

<p>Applications will be considered on a case by case basis. You should apply as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mai.gov.ro/en/british-citizens-in-the-context-of-brexit/" rel="external">Romanian Governmentâ€™s guidance on late applications</a> for further details. The current advice is under the â€˜Late Applicationsâ€™ section.</p>

<h3>Pending applications</h3>

<p>All applications introduced until 31 December 2021 and not finalized before that deadline will continue to be processed.</p>

<p>A certificate of application is issued immediately after the Romanian competent authority has received the application. The certificate of application constitutes proof of rights as beneficiary of the Withdrawal Agreement, until the final decision on the application is made.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mai.gov.ro/en/british-citizens-in-the-context-of-brexit/" rel="external">Romanian governmentâ€™s guidance on late applications</a> for further details. The current advice is under the â€˜Pending Applicationsâ€™ section.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>

<p>If your application is refused, you will be notified about the appeal process and your deadline to appeal.</p>

<p>Find out more about how to appeal in the <a href="https://www.mai.gov.ro/en/british-citizens-in-the-context-of-brexit/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Romanian governmentâ€™s guidance â€˜Appeal Procedureâ€™ section</a>.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Romania at any point in the future. 
Find more information on who this applies to in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe guidance</a>. They must travel to Romania and <a href="https://www.mai.gov.ro/cetatenii-britanici-in-context-brexit/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">submit a permis de È™edere application as your family member</a> (scroll down to the English version, and select the â€˜permanent stay in Romaniaâ€™ section).</p>

<p>Nationals of certain non-EU countries may <a href="https://www.mae.ro/en/node/2040" rel="external" class="govuk-link">need a visa before travel</a>. The <a href="http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en/content/entry-romania" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Romanian authorities issue family reunion visas free of charge</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Romania.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Romania</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/romania/entry-requirements#passport-validity" class="govuk-link">Romania travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling to other EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. If you have citizenship of an EU or EFTA country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Romania using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>Romania is not part of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you stay in Romania with a Romanian residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit in Romania or for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit countries in the Schengen area, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>.</p>

<p>Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Romania before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your permis de È™edere residence card or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence card, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence card, show your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Romania, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Romania with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must <a href="http://igi.mai.gov.ro/en/content/access-health-care" rel="external" class="govuk-link">register for healthcare</a> as a resident in Romania.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-romania">healthcare in Romania</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study" class="govuk-link">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>

<h3>Exchanging your UK, Gibraltar, Jersey or Guernsey licence</h3>

<p>If you live in Romania you can use your current valid driving licence. However, you may exchange it for a Romanian licence if you wish. You must exchange your UK licence for a Romanian licence before your UK licence expires. You will need a â€˜certificate of entitlementâ€™ to be able to apply for a Romanian driving licence.</p>

<p>You cannot use an International Driving Permit (IDP) instead of exchanging your licence.</p>

<h3>Exchanging your Isle of Man licence</h3>

<p>If you have a licence from the Isle of Man you will need to take a test to exchange your licence. You will need a <a class="govuk-link" href="#certificate-of-entitlement">certificate of entitlement</a> to be able to apply for a Romanian driving licence.</p>

<p>You cannot use an International Driving Permit (IDP) instead of exchanging your licence.</p>

<p>You should obtain this from the DVLA if your licence was issued in Great Britain (England, Wales or Scotland), or your issuing authority if your licence was issued in Northern Ireland, Gibraltar, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man. You will need to get the certificate translated into Romanian.
