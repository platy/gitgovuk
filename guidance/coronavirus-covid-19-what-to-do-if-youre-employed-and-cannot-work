<p>If your employer has less or no work for you because of coronavirus, they could get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-could-be-covered-by-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</a> grant to help them to carry on paying you.</p>

<p>This is known as being put ‘on furlough’ or ‘on flexible furlough’, and means that you’ll get at least 80% of your normal pay.</p>

<p>If your income is reduced because of these changes, you might be able to get regular payments to help.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have made enough National Insurance contributions over the last 2 to 3 years</p>
