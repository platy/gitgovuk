<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) allocates and funds early years initial teacher training (<abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr>) places each academic year. <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> leads to the award of Early Years Teacher Status (<abbr title="early tears teacher status">EYTS</abbr>).</p>

<p>We provide training bursaries and training grants to attract high-quality graduates to become early years teachers.</p>

<p>You can only use this funding to offer training programmes that help trainees to meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">teachers’ standards (early years)</a>. The training grant includes the costs of assessment to meet these standards.</p>

<p>Trainees and potential applicants should visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/become-an-early-years-teacher" rel="external">Get Into Teaching</a> website and our list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-initial-teacher-training-itt-providers-and-school-direct-early-years-lead-organisations"><abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> training providers</a> for more information. Employers should visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-years-initial-teacher-training-itt-a-guide-for-employers"><abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr>: a guide for employers</a>.</p>

<h2>Training routes</h2>

<p>We offer funding for 2 out of the 4 <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> training routes.</p>

<h3>Graduate entry route</h3>

<p>This is for graduates studying full-time. Training is typically over a 1 year period.</p>

<p><abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> providers will receive training grant funding of £7,000 to cover course fees.</p>

<p>Trainees with high academic achievement may be eligible to receive a training bursary. This will be paid to the you to forward to your trainees.</p>

<h3>Graduate employment-based route</h3>

<p>This is for graduates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in paid employment</li>
  <li>in an early years setting</li>
  <li>who need training and further experience to demonstrate the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">teachers’ standards (early years)</a>
</li>
  <li>who have the right to work in the UK for the duration of the training</li>
</ul>

<p>£14,000 is available for this route, made up of a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£7,000 training grant for providers</li>
  <li>£7,000 employer incentive for the trainee’s employer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Undergraduate entry</h3>

<p>Funding is not available for this route. Trainees should contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance">Student Finance England</a> to see if they can receive a tuition fee or maintenance loan.</p>

<p>This route is for undergraduates who want to take a level 6 degree in an early childhood-related subject along with <abbr title="early tears teacher status">EYTS</abbr>.</p>

<p>This route is full-time and takes 3 or 4 years.</p>

<h3>Assessment only</h3>

<p>This is a self-funded route for graduates who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are very experienced at working with children from birth to 5 years old</li>
  <li>can demonstrate the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">teachers’ standards (early years)</a> without any further training</li>
</ul>

<p>This could be an early years teacher who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>practiced overseas</li>
  <li>understands the early years foundation stage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Training bursaries</h2>

<p>Training bursaries are only available to trainees registered on the graduate entry route. You should use the trainee’s highest qualification to determine how much they’ll get, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tier 1, £5,000: first-class honours degree, doctoral degree</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tier 2, £4,000: 2.1 honours degree, master’s degree</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tier 3, £2,000: 2.2 honours degree, aegrotat (unclassified) honours degree</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No bursary: third-class honours degree, ordinary degree, aegrotat ordinary degree, no first degree</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Medical first degrees</h3>

<p>First degrees in medicine, which are qualifying awards in professional terms, are not classified. Although usually entitled ‘bachelor’, they are at level 7 (master’s level) on the FHEQ. However, this only applies to degrees that are 5 years in length.</p>

<p>You may consider 5-year degrees in medicine, dentistry, veterinary science and surgery as equivalent to a 2:1 degree for the award of a bursary. A first or distinction in an integrated master’s medical degree can be considered equivalent to a first class degree for the purpose of awarding a bursary.</p>

<p>There are also medical bachelor’s degrees which may be awarded as exit awards to students who satisfy the criteria specified but fail to meet the criteria for progression to the fourth or fifth year of the qualifying medical degree.</p>

<p>These qualifications are often called Bachelor’s of Medical Science (B Med Sci). You can consider these degrees as equivalent to a 2:2 degree for the purpose of awarding a bursary.</p>

<p>A number of award titles may be used in both categories of award. We advise you to check individual cases with the relevant awarding bodies before making a decision about awarding bursaries.</p>

<h3>Professional and vocational qualifications</h3>

<p>Providers will need to make sure that those responsible for decisions on entry understand, or have access to, advice on the range of professional and vocational qualifications generally regarded as equivalent to a first (bachelor’s) degree at 2:2 or above.</p>

<p>It is for you to decide whether a candidate’s qualification meets this criterion, and whether it demonstrates the breadth and type of academic engagement that would be expected from first degree study. Partnerships that do not include degree-awarding bodies may wish to seek advice from those that are.</p>

<h3>Qualifications record keeping</h3>

<p>You must keep accurate records of trainees’ qualifications and how they obtained them.</p>

<p>You should record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>names of all trainees granted a bursary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>details of how you assessed the trainees’ qualifications</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We may ask to see these records at any time. You should keep copies of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>original trainee documentation or qualification certificates</li>
  <li>correspondence between you and trainees</li>
  <li>other documentation relating to the decision process</li>
</ul>

<h4>Eligibility</h4>

<p>To receive a training bursary, trainees must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/early-years-initial-teacher-training-a-guide-for-providers#recruiting-trainees">entry requirements</a>
</li>
  <li>take a qualifying postgraduate Graduate Entry course</li>
  <li>hold a UK first degree with at least second-class honours (or equivalent)</li>
  <li>meet the terms and conditions of the bursary scheme</li>
  <li>not already hold <abbr title="early tears teacher status">EYTS</abbr> or Early Years Professional Status (<abbr title="Early Years Professional Status">EYPS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>not do any type of paid-teaching work which contributes to their training whilst undertaking a Graduate Entry course, for which the provider received early years funding</li>
  <li>not be registered on another <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify trainees in writing that they’re eligible</li>
  <li>ensure that trainees continue to meet the criteria throughout the course</li>
</ul>

<h2>Training Bursary payments</h2>

<p>You should pay bursaries in 10 monthly instalments.</p>

    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Bursary award</th>
      <th scope="col">Monthly instalment</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>£5,000</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>£2000</td>
      <td>£200</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Payment eligibility</h3>

<p>Trainees will be entitled to receive the first bursary payment if they’re actively engaged on the <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> programme on the first day of the month following their start date.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
A trainee commencing their course in September 2021 will be entitled to their first payment if they are on the programme on 1 October. They’ll be entitled to the second payment if they are on the programme on 1 November respectively. This is regardless of the provider’s individual payment date.</p>
</div>

<h3>Payments for part-time or modular courses</h3>

<p>Trainees on part-time or modular courses may agree a flexible monthly payment plan, which covers the duration of the part-time programme in order to avoid financial hardship for the trainee. However, you must make sure that the bursary payments reflect the proportion of the course that the trainee has completed at any point.</p>

<p>As part-time courses will span more than one academic year, you may award the bursary beyond the academic year 2021 to 2022. You are reminded that any bursary payments made after 31 July of the academic year will be included as expenditure for the following academic year.</p>

<h2>Training Grant</h2>

<p>You must use the training grant funding to meet all training costs for each trainee.</p>

<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>charge any additional fees</li>
  <li>switch allocated funding to other trainees</li>
</ul>

<h3>Full-time equivalence (<abbr title="full-time equivalence">FTE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>We calculate funding using the <abbr title="full-time equivalence">FTE</abbr> principle:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">FTE equivalence</th>
      <th scope="col">Trainee status</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0.5 or less</td>
      <td>part-time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0.6 or more</td>
      <td>full-time</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Employer Incentive</h2>

<p>The employer incentive is forwarded to the trainee’s employer. It’s a contribution towards costs that employers incur, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supply cover</li>
  <li>salary enhancements</li>
  <li>employment costs</li>
  <li>National Insurance</li>
  <li>additional training costs and other overheads</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot use the employer incentive for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sick pay</li>
  <li>maternity or paternity pay</li>
  <li>costs not related to training such as buying equipment or internal training</li>
  <li>costs that have occurred outside of their training period</li>
</ul>

<p>If there any claims for Employer Incentive which are not covered by the above, please contact <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>.Funding@education.gov.uk for further advice.</p>

<h3>Types of company</h3>

<p>The trainee must be an employee of the early years business. Sole traders and business partners are not eligible for an employer incentive as they’re classed as self-employed by HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>If the early years business is a limited company, the owners and those working for the company are not classed as self-employed and can be eligible for an employer incentive.</p>

<h2>Withdrawals and deferrals</h2>

<p>A withdrawal is when a trainee who has started a course informs their provider they no longer wish to continue. A deferral is when a trainee who has started a course agrees with their provider for their course to be paused temporarily and confirms that they intend to return.</p>

<p>If a trainee withdraws or defers, you must stop any further payments and update your records immediately on  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register trainee teachers</a>.</p>

<p>You can keep some funding if a trainee withdraws or defers. The amount retained should be proportional to how long the trainee attended the course before leaving.</p>

<p>Graduate employment based <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> providers can keep 1/12th of the total training grant and employer incentive funding for each month or part month the trainee remained in training.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
(Graduate Employment Based)</p>

<p>If a trainee is employed from September 2021 and leaves in March 2022, you can retain 7/12th of the Training Grant and Employer Incentive funding.
Graduate Entry trainees who withdraw or defer from a course will be entitled to be paid the training bursary for each month up to, and including, the month in which they formally withdraw.  EYITT providers can also retain 1/10th of the total training grant for each month or part month the trainee remained in training.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> 
(Graduate Entry)</p>

<p>If a trainee starts their programme in September 2021 and withdraws or defers in January 2022, they’ll be entitled to 4 payments in total as they were active on the course on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 October 2021</li>
  <li>1 November 2021</li>
  <li>1 December 2021</li>
  <li>1 January 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also retain 4/10th of the Training Grant funding.</p>
</div>

<p>In the event that a Graduate Entry trainee is absent through sickness, you may only make one further bursary payment following the first day of absence.  You may also retain an additional 1/10th of the Training Grant.</p>

<p>For Graduate Employment Based trainees, you may retain an additional 1/12th of the Training Grant and Employer Incentive in this instance.</p>

<p>After this, the absence should be treated as a period of deferral and payments must stop with immediate effect.</p>

<h3>Overpayments</h3>

<p>We’ll recover any overpayments if a trainee withdraws or defers and will not reimburse you for any payments you make in error. Any overpayments made to trainees or employers will then be an internal matter between you and the trainee or employer.</p>

<h2>Returning trainees</h2>

<p>Returning trainees who defer and then rejoin their original course, or take any advanced standing or credit to a new <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course, will only be eligible to receive the remaining <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> funding (training grant or bursary) up to the value which was available in the year they started their original course. A bespoke payment schedule may be agreed for the remaining amount between you and the trainee.</p>

<p>Where the length of the course is increased, the bursary and training grant instalments can be amended to reflect the longer timeframe. The total amounts, however, are fixed and cannot be increased.</p>

<p>If a trainee leaves one <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> course and joins a new one with no transfer of standing or credit from their previous course, this is viewed as a separate route to <abbr title="early tears teacher status">EYTS</abbr>. They’ll be entitled to receive a new bursary and training grant, subject to the eligibility criteria and rates set in this guidance.</p>

<p>If the trainee received their full bursary or training grant entitlement during a previous <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> programme, this may impact their eligibility to receive further <abbr title="early years initial teacher training">EYITT</abbr> funding while completing a new programme. Please contact the Funding Team at <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>.Funding@education.gov.uk for further advice.</p>

<h2>How you’ll receive your funding</h2>

<p>You’ll be sent a remittance advice from the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) when you’ve been paid, and you can use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.register-trainee-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Register trainee teachers</a> to review your payment profile.</p>

<p>You’ll be paid in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>11 monthly BACS instalments from September to July</li>
  <li>7 working days from the 1st day of the month</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be paid different amounts until we have collected all your data, as set out in this table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Month</th>
      <th scope="col">Rate</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>

<p>We’ll recover any overpayments by sending you an invoice or deducting any future payments.</p>
