<p>Everyone has the same basic tax-free allowance before they must pay Inheritance Tax. The current threshold is £325,000. If the threshold has not been fully used when the first person in a marriage or civil partnership dies, you can transfer it. The unused part can go to the surviving spouse or civil partner.</p>

<h2>Rules for transferring unused basic threshold</h2>

<p>The basic tax-free allowance available when a spouse or civil partner dies can be as much as £650,000 if none of their £325,000 threshold was used when the first partner of the couple died.</p>

<p>The percentage of the threshold that was not used when the first partner died increases the basic threshold that’s available for the surviving partner’s estate.</p>

<p>You can only transfer threshold if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the couple were married or in a civil partnership when the first death occurred</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you send the request to HMRC within 2 years of the death of the surviving spouse or civil partner</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Work out the percentage of unused basic threshold available and apply it</h2>

<p>To work out the percentage of unused threshold available to transfer,  you must  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-inheritance-tax-thresholds-and-interest-rates">use the threshold in use at the time</a> the first spouse or civil partner died.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Example 1</p>

<p>Carole dies leaving an estate worth £600,000. She leaves £130,000 to her children and the rest to her husband Simon. The threshold in use at the time was £325,000.</p>

<p>The £130,000 left to the children would use up 40% (£130,000 ÷ £325,000 x 100) of the threshold, leaving 60% unused.</p>

<p>When Simon dies, the threshold is still £325,000. His available threshold would increase by the unused percentage (60%) to £520,000 (£325,000 x 60% +£325,000).</p>

<p>If Simon’s estate is not worth more than £520,000 there’ll be no Inheritance Tax to pay when he dies. Inheritance Tax would be payable on anything above £520,000.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>Example 2</p>

<p>David dies leaving an estate worth £800,000. He leaves £50,000 to his friend Sandra, and the rest to his civil partner, Mark. The threshold in use at the time was £250,000.</p>

<p>The £50,000 left to Sandra would use up 20% (£50,000 ÷ £250,000 x 100) of the threshold, leaving 80% unused.</p>

<p>When Mark dies, the threshold is £325,000. Mark’s available threshold would increase by the unused percentage (80%) to £585,000 (£325,000 x 80% + £325,000).</p>

<p>If Mark’s estate is not worth more than £585,000 there’ll be no Inheritance Tax to pay when he dies. Inheritance Tax would be payable on anything above £585,000.</p>
</div>

<h2>Make a claim to transfer unused basic threshold</h2>

<p>The way you make a claim  depends on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type of estate you’re dealing with</li>
  <li>the date the person died</li>
  <li>whether you transfer less than the full threshold</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where full details are not needed — excepted estates</h3>

<p>If it’s an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/check-type-of-estate">excepted estate</a> check which process you need to follow.</p>

<p>For deaths on or before 31 December 2021 you can only make a claim to transfer the full unused threshold with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inheritance-tax-claim-to-transfer-unused-nil-rate-band-for-excepted-estates-iht217">form IHT217</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re transferring less than the full unused threshold, you’ll no longer qualify as an excepted estate. You must make a full return of estate with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inheritance-tax-inheritance-tax-account-iht400">form IHT400</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inheritance-tax-claim-to-transfer-unused-nil-rate-band-iht402">form IHT402</a>.</p>

<p>For deaths on or after 1 January 2022 you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can transfer any unused amount</li>
  <li>should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/applying-for-probate">claim when you apply for probate</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inheritance-tax-confirmation-c1">If the person who died lived in Scotland</a> use form C1.</p>

<h3>If you’re making a full return of estate with form IHT400</h3>

<p>If you must make a full return of the estate you’ll need to transfer unused threshold with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inheritance-tax-inheritance-tax-account-iht400">form IHT400</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inheritance-tax-claim-to-transfer-unused-nil-rate-band-iht402">form IHT402</a>.</p>
