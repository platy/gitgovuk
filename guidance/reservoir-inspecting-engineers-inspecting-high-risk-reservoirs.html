<p>This guidance is for inspecting engineers. You should follow this guidance when inspecting a high-risk reservoir.</p>

<p>It follows recommendations in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/toddbrook-reservoir-incident-2019-independent-review">Toddbrook reservoir incident (2019): independent review</a>, to provide more advice to improve inspections.</p>

<p>You should also follow guidance about reservoir safety on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://britishdams.org/reservoir-safety/res-safety-resources/#guidance" rel="external">British Dams Socifurthety website</a> when you inspect high-risk reservoirs.</p>

<p>High-risk reservoirs must be inspected at least every 10 years. You must write a section 10 inspection report for the reservoir owner or operator as soon as practicable after completing your inspection.</p>

<p>If you cannot provide your final report within 6 months, you must tell the Environment Agency Reservoir Safety Team and explain why. You should contact them by email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:reservoirs@environment-agency.gov.uk">reservoirs@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Inspect spillways closely and by direct access</h2>

<p>You should inspect spillways closely and by direct access during your visit.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-research-reports/spillway-design-examination-and-failure-mechanisms">guide on examining spillways</a>. It explains how to do close, direct inspections and when alternative methods of access are appropriate.</p>

<h2>Consider previous inspection reports</h2>

<p>Problems can arise if you over rely on the content of previous inspection reports. Stay curious about the records used for each inspection and the evidence that supports statements in the report.</p>

<p>To spot reservoir safety issues, for example design weaknesses and potential vulnerabilities, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compare the original design and as-built drawings against current standards - use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-research-reports/spillway-design-examination-and-failure-mechanisms">reservoir spillways design guide</a> to check for missing or unusual features</li>
  <li>assess if the structural condition has changed from the original design</li>
  <li>assess if the hydraulic performance has changed from the original design</li>
  <li>assess the potential failure mechanisms - list any clues and how to evaluate them</li>
  <li>consider the history of past problems, repairs and maintenance</li>
</ul>

<p>Chapter 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-research-reports/spillway-design-examination-and-failure-mechanisms">spillway examination guide</a> contains other good practices to review information.</p>

<p>The owner or operator will provide a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reservoir-owner-and-operator-guidance-inspection-information-pack">reservoir inspection information pack</a>. It is also recommended you do your own independent research using online resources. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ice.org.uk/knowledge-and-resources/ice-library/ice-archive" rel="external">Institution of Civil Engineers Archives</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/services/flood-estimation-handbook" rel="external">Flood Estimation Handbook</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://mapapps2.bgs.ac.uk/geoindex/home.html" rel="external">British Geological Survey GeoIndex</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://maps.nls.uk/os/" rel="external">historical Ordnance Survey maps</a></li>
  <li>local history websites</li>
  <li>historic images on Google Earth</li>
</ul>

<p>If critical information does not exist, consider recommending investigations to get the information as a measure in the interests of safety (<abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>). When there is not enough information to rule out design weaknesses, consider recommending further analysis as a <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>. Examples of further analysis include structural assessment, hydraulic analysis (which might include physical or computational modelling) and geotechnical analysis.</p>

<p>You should provide a clear summary of your judgements in your inspection report.</p>

<h2>Write measures in the interests of safety (<abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> can reduce the risk of an uncontrolled escape of water. They are essential actions that the reservoir owner or operator must take, by a specified deadline, to improve the safety of the reservoir. If they do not, they will be breaking the law.</p>

<p>When writing the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>, you should clearly explain the seriousness of the risk, the action that needs taking and when it must be done. You must include all the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> in the inspection report.</p>

<p>To convey an appropriate sense of urgency of when the owner or operator must complete the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>, you could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set very clear and demanding deadlines for starting the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>set appropriate deadlines for completing the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>recommend that preparations and planning for the works (to investigate or remedy a defect) should start by a set date</li>
  <li>recommend the appointment of a qualified civil engineer within a set time from when you issue the inspection report</li>
  <li>tell them that their reservoir poses an unacceptably high risk to the population downstream if they do not complete the recommended works</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot confirm a remedial action without more investigations, list the investigations as part of your <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> and set a date to complete them. You should also state that when the investigations are complete, the qualified civil engineer will set the scope of and completion date for the remedial action.</p>

<p>If the owner or operator does not complete the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> by the deadline they have broken the law and the Environment Agency may take enforcement action.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> in the previous section 10 inspection report are not complete, you must add any new information in your report. In doing so, you must follow the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> position statement. Email the Environment Agency Reservoir Safety Team for the statement <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:reservoirs@environment-agency.gov.uk">reservoirs@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Put precautionary measures in place</h2>

<p>If you recommend <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>, you should explain in the section 10 inspection report the importance of using precautionary measures until the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> are complete. Include precautionary measures within the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> if appropriate.</p>

<p>You should consider any environmental legal obligations the owner or operator may have. Such considerations may relate to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/water-discharge-and-groundwater-activity-environmental-permits">environmental permit</a>
</li>
  <li>having a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/water-management-abstract-or-impound-water">water abstraction or impoundment licence</a>
</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-damage-prevention-and-remediation-regulations-2009-guidance-for-england-and-wales">avoiding causing environmental damage</a></li>
  <li>fish protection – <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts">contact the Environment Agency for advice</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In an emergency, saving lives may take the priority over these environmental legal obligations.</p>

<p>Owners and operators are responsible for understanding the legal requirements. It is not your role to explain these to them.</p>

<p>The precautionary measures will depend on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether there is an imminent threat</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>characteristics of the catchment</li>
  <li>the consequences of taking no action</li>
</ul>

<p>Types of precautionary measures that might be available include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using by-washes to divert flow away from the reservoir</li>
  <li>isolating or diverting any indirect catchments</li>
  <li>emergency reinforcement to support an embankment</li>
  <li>lowering water levels in any upstream reservoirs to provide additional storage and consider new telemetry to monitor water levels</li>
  <li>temporarily lowering the reservoir water level (based on the level of the lowest defect) - if drawdown pipes do not exist or are inadequate, use pumping</li>
  <li>increasing water level monitoring and setting alarm triggers for taking further actions</li>
  <li>increasing flood attenuation in any upstream reservoirs by raising its overflow structure within safe limits in an emergency to protect a dam</li>
  <li>increasing surveillance to spot signs of further deterioration (for example more visits and monitoring)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-research-reports/risk-assessment-for-reservoirs">guide to risk assessment for reservoir safety management</a> can help you determine reductions in probability of failure.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-research-reports/guide-to-drawdown-capacity-for-reservoir-safety-and-emergency-planning">guide to drawdown capacity for reservoir safety and emergency planning</a> explains how to lower reservoir water levels safely and how to plan for an emergency. In addition, you should highlight the importance for an owner or operator to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up reporting procedures to send observations and readings to the qualified civil engineer promptly</li>
  <li>talk to the Environment Agency and local stakeholders about the measures, level of protection downstream and how you will manage storm flows</li>
  <li>check if there are local environmental restrictions on the reservoir volume, depth or discharge</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formal meeting about the inspection findings</h2>

<p>You should arrange a meeting with the reservoir operator or owner and the supervising engineer. The formal meeting could be in person, as a conference call or an online meeting. You should do this promptly, particularly if urgent actions or immediate precautionary measures are required. In any case, the meeting should be within one month of the inspection.</p>

<p>At that meeting you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discuss the initial findings</li>
  <li>explain any urgent actions and immediate precautionary measures required</li>
  <li>discuss provisional recommendations for <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> and statutory maintenance</li>
  <li>clearly explain the risks and safety implications of not carrying out the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>discuss and agree start and finish dates for the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>explain that the completion date is the trigger for enforcement action and does not represent the urgency</li>
  <li>ask whether the owner or operator of multiple reservoirs has a Portfolio Risk Assessment, which you could consider when setting timescales for <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> recommendations</li>
  <li>discuss anything else to do with completing the inspection</li>
</ul>

<p>You should make a written record of the meeting (the minutes) and share them with the people that attend. Check that they all agree with the minutes.</p>

<p>The final section 10 inspection report does not need to have the same findings and recommendations as the minutes. But if these do change you should let the reservoir owner or operator know immediately. Communicate this by email or provide them with a draft copy of the inspection report.</p>

<h2>Statutory maintenance after the inspection</h2>

<p>You should record statutory maintenance as a recommendation in section 10(3)b of the inspection report.</p>

<p>Guidance on maintenance recommendations are on page 50 (paragraphs 4 to 7) of the Institution of Civil Engineers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/book/10.1680/gra.57692" rel="external">A Guide to the Reservoirs Act 1975, second edition</a>.</p>

<p>These safety recommendations should cover any aspects of maintenance that are unsatisfactory at the time of the inspection. Also consider aspects that are currently acceptable but may lead to deterioration if the maintenance regime is cut back or reduced.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> lead to new works, you should do either of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain what maintenance the new works need</li>
  <li>arrange for the qualified civil engineer of the new works to specify a maintenance regime</li>
</ul>

<p>If the owner or operator needs to complete maintenance for reservoir safety by a set time, include them as <abbr title="measures in the interests of safety">MIOS</abbr> in the section 10 inspection report.</p>
