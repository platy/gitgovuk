<p>You cannot claim until the relevant Freeport tax site has been designated. Check which sites are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/maps-of-freeports-and-freeport-tax-sites">designated Freeport tax sites</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who can claim</h2>

<p>You can claim the relief if you have a business premises in a Freeport tax site.</p>

<p>To claim the relief, all employees must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spend 60% of their working time in the Freeport tax site, unless you have made adjustments to your employee’s working arrangement to accommodate:
    <ul>
      <li>disability</li>
      <li>pregnancy</li>
      <li>maternity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>be new employees from 6 April 2022, and before 6 April 2026, within the first 36 months of their employment</li>
  <li>not have been employed by you or a connected employer in the previous 24 months</li>
</ul>

<h2>How much relief you can claim</h2>

<p>You will only need to pay Secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions if your employee earns more than the Freeport Upper Secondary Threshold of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£25,000 per year</li>
  <li>£2,083 per month</li>
  <li>£481 per week</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that if an employee earns less than this, then no Secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions are due.</p>

<h2>How long you can claim the relief for</h2>

<p>You can claim this relief for all new employees for 36 months from the start of their employment for the period that they meet the qualifying conditions.</p>

<h2>How to claim relief</h2>

<p>To claim the relief, you must apply the relevant National Insurance contributions category letter when running payroll. Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/running-payroll">run payroll</a>.</p>

<p>HMRC have issued 4 new National Insurance contributions category letters to support employers claiming this relief. They are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Category letter</th>
      <th scope="col">Employee group</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>Standard category letter equivalent</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I</td>
      <td>Married women and widows entitled to pay reduced National Insurance contributions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>S</td>
      <td>Employees over state pension age</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>L</td>
      <td>Employees who can defer National Insurance contributions</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You must keep evidence of the qualifying conditions being met.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>An example of an employee earning below the Freeport Upper Secondary Threshold</h3>

<p>The employer hires an employee on 1 July 2022 who is paid £2,000 per month gross by the employer (£24,000 a year).</p>

<p>At the start of the employment the employer reasonably expects that the employee will spend 4 days (30 hours, 80%) of their working time at the employer’s business premises in a Freeport tax site and 1 day (7.5 hours, 20%) of their working week working from home for the remainder of the 2022 to 2023 tax year so the employee meets the 60% rule.</p>

<p>In practice the employee never works different working time and location arrangements.</p>

<p>The employee was not employed by the employer or a connected employer in the previous 24 months.</p>

<p>The employee and the employer both meet the rules, and the employer claims the relief.</p>

<p>As the employee’s earnings are less than the Freeport Upper Secondary Threshold of £2,083 per month, the employer will pay no secondary National Insurance contributions for this employee.</p>

<h3>An example of an employee earnings above the Freeport Upper Secondary Threshold</h3>

<p>The employer hires an employee on 23 May 2022 who is paid £3,000 per month gross by the employer (£36,000 a year).</p>

<p>At the start of the employment the employer reasonably expects that the employee will spend all of their working time at the employer’s business premises so the employee meets the 60% rule.</p>

<p>In practice the employee never works different working time and location arrangements.</p>

<p>The employee was not employed by the employer or a connected employer in the previous 24 months.</p>

<p>The employee and the employer both meet the rules, and the employer claims the relief.</p>

<p>As the employee’s earnings are more than the Freeport Upper Secondary Threshold of £2,083 per month, the employer will pay secondary National Insurance contributions on the amounts above the Freeport Upper Secondary Threshold.</p>

<h3>An example of an employee not spending 60% of their working time in the Freeport tax site</h3>

<p>The employer hires an employee on 1 October 2022 who is paid £3,000 per month gross by the employer (£36,000 a year).</p>

<p>At the start of the employment the employer reasonably expects that the employee will spend 2 days (40% of their working time) at the employer’s business premises in a Freeport tax site and 3 days (60% of their working time) working from home so the employee does not meet the 60% rule.</p>

<p>The employee was not employed by the employer or a connected employer in the previous 24 months.</p>

<p>The employee does not meet the rules for claiming the relief so the employer cannot claim the relief.</p>

<p>The employer will pay secondary National Insurance contributions as normal without claiming the relief on all earnings above the Secondary Threshold (£737 per Month).</p>
