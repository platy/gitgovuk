<h2>Misconduct hearings</h2>

<p>To increase openness and transparency in the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> (and the police service in general), misconduct hearings, special case hearings and police appeals tribunals, involving Police Officers, are held in public.</p>

<p>Misconduct hearings deal with allegations of gross misconduct committed by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> officers on or off duty. Gross misconduct is defined as ‘a breach of the police standards of professional behaviour (<abbr title="police standards of professional behaviour">PSPB</abbr>)’ that is so serious as to justify dismissal’. Misconduct hearings form part of the disciplinary process and are not criminal proceedings.</p>

<h2>Accelerated Misconduct Hearings</h2>

<p>Accelerated Misconduct Hearings take place when the investigation of allegations of Gross Misconduct, committed by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> officers on or off duty, identifies that special conditions, such as the following are satisfied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that there is sufficient evidence, in the form of written statements or other documents, to establish on the balance of probabilities that the conduct of the officer concerned constitutes Gross Misconduct</li>
  <li>it is in the public interest for the officer concerned to cease to be a member of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> without delay</li>
</ul>

<h2>Police Appeals Tribunals</h2>

<p>Police Appeals Tribunals deal with appeals submitted by <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> officers, against the findings and/or the outcomes of misconduct hearings (including accelerated misconduct hearings), under the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> Conduct Regulations, or stage 3 meetings under the Performance Regulations.</p>

<p>The decision to hold misconduct hearings and police appeals tribunals in public was announced by the Home Secretary in 2015. The Ministry of Defence Police followed suit in March 2017 by amendments to the Ministry of Defence Police conduct (2015) and performance (2012) regulations, and by subsequent revision of those Regulations into the new Ministry of Defence Police (Conduct, Performance and Appeals Tribunals) Regulations 2020, which came into effect for all cases assessed as Gross Misconduct after 2 November 2020.</p>

<p>This change of legislation does not affect misconduct meetings, where a breach of <abbr title="police standards of professional behaviour">PSPB</abbr> does not amount to gross misconduct. These proceedings will be held in private and the public have no right to observe (except in the case of a complainant or the commission^, where appropriate).</p>

<p>^Director General (IOPC) or Ombudsman (NI) if they conducted or directed the investigation.</p>

<h2>What happens at a misconduct hearing</h2>

<p>At a misconduct hearing the facts are heard by a panel, often with the help of witnesses, to enable a finding to be made. If an officer is found to have committed misconduct or gross misconduct, depending on the circumstances, the available outcomes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>written warning (only if misconduct only found)</li>
  <li>final written warning</li>
  <li>reduction in rank</li>
  <li>dismissal without notice</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens at an Accelerated Misconduct Hearing</h2>

<p>An accelerated hearing is heard by the Chief Constable. Due to the evidence being incontrovertible there is no requirement for any witness attendance. If an officer is found to have committed gross misconduct, the available outcomes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>final written warning</li>
  <li>reduction in rank</li>
  <li>dismissal without notice</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens at a Police Appeals Tribunal</h2>

<p>Police appeals tribunals are heard by a panel chaired by a person nominated by the Lord Chancellor who satisfies the judicial appointment criteria.  The tribunal determines whether the ‘grounds of appeal’ on which the appellant relies, have been made out. On the determination of an appeal, a tribunal may make an order dealing with the appellant in any way in which they could have been dealt with at the original hearing.</p>

<h2>Attending a misconduct hearing</h2>

<p>Any member of the public or press can request to attend a misconduct hearing, provided that they are aged 18 or over.</p>

<p>When the date of a misconduct hearing is confirmed, the details will be published below. Due to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence Police">MDP</abbr> being a national force the location of the misconduct hearing may vary (dependent upon the case).</p>

<h2>Private hearings</h2>

<p>Please note: in exceptional circumstances, the Chair can exclude anyone from all or part of the hearing at his/her discretion and may impose conditions relating to the attendance of any person.</p>

  <li>a specified person must be excluded from all or part of the hearing</li>
  <li>specific steps are taken to conceal the identity of a witness</li>
  <li>specific information must be excluded from the published notification of misconduct hearings or notification of outcome</li>
