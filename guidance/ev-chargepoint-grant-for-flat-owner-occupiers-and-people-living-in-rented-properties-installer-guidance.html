<h2>New digital service from 4 August 2022</h2>

<p>This new guidance and service replaces the interim guidance.</p>

<p>You should use this new service for all new applications.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-flat-owner-occupiers-and-people-living-in-rented-properties-installer-guidance">use the interim guidance and service</a> for any applications started before 4 August.</p>
</div>

<h2>About the grant</h2>

<p>The EV chargepoint grant for flat owner-occupiers and people living in rented properties is for anyone who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>owns and lives in a flat</li>
  <li>rents any residential property</li>
</ul>

<p>The grant covers up to 75% of the cost to buy and install a chargepoint socket, up to £350 per grant.</p>

<p>You will claim the grant on behalf of your customer.</p>

<p>The Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>) provides this grant.</p>

<h2>Who can apply?</h2>

<p>Your customer can apply for this grant if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they own and live in a flat or rent any residential property</li>
  <li>their home has its own private off-street parking space</li>
  <li>they own a qualifying vehicle</li>
</ul>

<p>They can also apply if moving to a house with an old chargepoint that they want to replace. They must not have received the grant before and must meet all other criteria.</p>

<p>Your customer cannot apply if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have already received this grant or a grant under the Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme</li>
  <li>are moving home</li>
  <li>want to move an existing chargepoint to a new property</li>
  <li>live in a house that they own</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must check if the customer meets the grant criteria.</p>
</div>

<h2>Does the property qualify?</h2>

<p>Your customer’s property must be in the UK. Properties in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man are not included.</p>

<p>They can only apply for an existing residential property that they live in.</p>

<p>They cannot use the grant for new-build or unoccupied properties.</p>

<p>For the chargepoint socket installed, the customer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a clearly-defined private off-street parking space</li>
  <li>have access to the parking space at all times</li>
  <li>own or have the sole legal right to the parking space</li>
</ul>

<p>A private parking space can be part of or separate from the property. You can ask your customer to show you their Land Registry title deeds to prove their legal right.</p>

<p>Your customer must get all legal rights and permissions, such as from the freeholder of a block of flats.</p>

<p>You cannot place cables over public land, such as pavements, without permission from your local authority. This applies even if it is temporary.</p>

<p>You will assess if each parking space allows an EV to charge safely. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will not intervene with your assessment.</p>

<h2>Does the vehicle qualify?</h2>

<p>This grant is only for vehicles on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-chargepoints-eligible-vehicles">list of <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved electric vehicles</a>.</p>

<p>Your customer must provide you with evidence that they either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are the registered keeper of one</li>
  <li>have one on order</li>
  <li>have leased one for at least 6 months, including via salary sacrifice</li>
  <li>have used one as a work vehicle for at least 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>They cannot apply for this grant if their vehicle is not on the list of approved electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Vehicles are listed at the request of their manufacturers. If a vehicle is not listed, contact the manufacturer to confirm why not.</p>

<h3>Vehicle leases</h3>

<p>If your customer’s vehicle lease is a bundle with a chargepoint, it must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state that they own the chargepoint once payment is complete</li>
  <li>itemise the cost of the chargepoint and installation, including VAT</li>
  <li>ensure the chargepoint warranty meets the grant requirements</li>
  <li>ensure the associated vehicle lease is for at least 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>Your customer must show you proof that they own or lease their electric vehicle.</p>

<h2>How the grant works for installers</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Your customer contacts you as an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-chargepoints-authorised-installers"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-authorised installer</a>.</li>
  <li>Check that your customer and the property qualify for the grant.</li>
  <li>Check that their vehicle is on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-chargepoints-eligible-vehicles">list of <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved electric vehicles</a>.</li>
  <li>Check that you are installing an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-approved-chargepoint-model-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved chargepoint model</a>.</li>
  <li>Survey the customer’s parking space and provide a quote.</li>
  <li>If they agree to proceed, log in to your account and create a new claim.</li>
  <li>Your customer will receive an online form to confirm the installation details.</li>
  <li>After completing the form, they will contact you to start the installation.</li>
  <li>When you finish the installation, you must upload proof. Evidence includes a copy of your invoice and photos of the chargepoint installed.</li>
  <li>Your customer’s invoice will include a discount to cover the grant amount. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will pay you the grant.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Grant processing times</h3>

<p>Your first claim may take up to 3 months for <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> to process. This is to allow time for you to be set up on the payment system.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> aims to process further claims within 30 working days.</p>

<p>Where possible, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will contact you if there is a delay in your claim.</p>

<p>To enquire about the progress of a claim, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk">ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Please provide the customer’s name, address, postcode and claim reference number.</p>

<h3>Chargepoint audits</h3>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> may select your installation for an audit to ensure it meets the grant requirements. The auditors may contact you to conduct the audit. If you fail to respond, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> may remove you from the scheme. The auditors will also contact your customer directly on <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>’s behalf.</p>

<h2>Grant rules and restrictions</h2>

<p>As an <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-authorised installer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help the customer to understand if they meet the grant criteria</li>
  <li>only install <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-approved-chargepoint-model-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>-approved chargepoint models</a>
</li>
  <li>test that all installed chargepoints work and meet safety requirements</li>
  <li>provide and upload all documentation to submit the claim</li>
  <li>not charge customers for the grant in advance of a claim</li>
  <li>provide the customer with one invoice per application</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chargepoints and sockets</h3>

<p>You must carry out chargepoint installations as per:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BS EN 61851-1:2019</li>
  <li>the current edition of the IET wiring regulations – BS 7671:2018+A1:2020</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/installer-guidance-electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-guidance-for-manufacturers-and-installers#fn:2">IET Code of Practice for Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment Installations (as amended)</a>
</li>
  <li>the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>The final installation must also meet electrical safety provisions under relevant building regulations.</p>

<p>You should install chargepoints to meet the needs of EV owners with disabilities or mobility issues.</p>

<p>The chargepoints you install must supply a minimum of 3kW to each chargepoint socket. This applies to sockets installed when they are being used for charging at the same time.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will reject your claim if your chargepoint model is not on the approved list. Chargepoints are listed at the request of their manufacturer. If a chargepoint is not listed, contact the manufacturer to confirm why not.</p>

<p>All chargepoints must have an on-site 3-year warranty on parts and installation. The landlord should contact you or the manufacturer if they have problems.</p>

<h3>Grant misuse</h3>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to take whatever action it thinks is appropriate if there is any evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grant requirements not being upheld</li>
  <li>fraudulent activity</li>
  <li>misuse of government funding by any party</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grant changes</h3>

<p>The government reserves the right to end or change this grant scheme at any time. If it ends or the grant amount changes, the government will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aim to provide 4 weeks’ notice</li>
  <li>honour claims made before any public announcement, subject to them meeting the grant criteria</li>
</ul>
