<p>The government has introduced&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3182" rel="external">new legislation</a> to make changes to how the Northern Ireland Protocol will apply. You should continue to use the guidance below for now.&nbsp;It will be updated in due course, giving you time to prepare for any new requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance applies to businesses in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) exporting or moving food, drink and agricultural products to, or through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>non-<abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> countries</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>You need an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-export-health-certificate">export health certificate (<abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr>)</a> or other certificate to export or move:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#export-or-move-processed-food-and-drinks">processed food and drink</a></li>
  <li>food or drink that contains products of animal origin (<abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr>)</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#vegetables-fruit-and-other-plants">vegetables, fruit and other plants used as food</a></li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> means animal products for human consumption such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meat</li>
  <li>fish</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>dairy</li>
  <li>honey</li>
  <li>gelatine</li>
</ul>

<p>Some countries require another type of export certificate for certain products.</p>

<p>If your product was made in Great Britain, check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/contact/consumers/find-details/contact-a-local-food-safety-team" rel="external">food safety team</a> in the local authority where your product was manufactured.</p>

<p>You can check each country’s rules by talking to your importer or getting help <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides">researching your export market</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a ban on exporting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-luxury-goods-to-north-korea-or-syria-special-rules">caviar, caviar substitutes, truffles and goods containing truffles to Syria and North Korea</a>.</p>

<p>Contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle">Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency¶">APHA</abbr>) Centre for International Trade Carlisle</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Export or move processed food and drinks</h2>

<p>You need an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-export-health-certificate"><abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr></a> to export or move most processed food and drink products that contain <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#export-or-move-POAO">the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> or Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#export-to-non-eu">non-<abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> countries</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not usually need an <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr> if your processed food and drink product does not contain <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Examples of processed foods containing <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> include products such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lasagne</li>
  <li>pork pie</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also need a certificate of free sale to <a class="govuk-link" href="#export-to-non-eu">export processed food and drink to non-<abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> countries</a>. The food authority in the country you’re exporting to will tell you if you need one.</p>

<p>If you export any soft drinks with added sugar, you may need to register for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/soft-drinks-industry-levy">Soft Drinks Industry Levy</a>. You can claim a credit for any exported drinks you pay the levy on.</p>

<h2>Export or move food or drink that contains <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> or Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>You’ll need an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-export-health-certificate">export health certificate (<abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr>)</a> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>export food or drink that contains <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> from Great Britain to the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>move them from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>transit through the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> and Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re moving food or drink that contains <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> to Northern Ireland, you do not need to pay for them to be inspected and certified. The certifier invoices the government for these costs as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/movement-assistance-scheme-get-help-with-moving-agrifood-goods-to-northern-ireland">Movement Assistance Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>There’s an <a class="govuk-link" href="#grace-period">arrangement for authorised traders</a> moving food from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get your goods checked at an <a class="govuk-link" href="#find-the-correct-BCP"><abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> border control post (<abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr>)</a> or Northern Ireland point of entry in the first country you enter</li>
  <li>make sure your <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> or Northern Ireland-based import agent has notified the <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> or Northern Ireland point of entry that your consignment is arriving - check with the <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> or Northern Ireland point of entry for how much notice needs to be given</li>
  <li>comply with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">wider HMRC guidance on customs requirements for exporting to the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trading-and-moving-goods-in-and-out-of-northern-ireland-from-1-january-2021">HMRC guidance for moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are different rules for exporting or moving:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-food-for-animals-special-rules">pet food or animal feed</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-or-moving-fish-from-the-uk">live fish</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-or-move-composite-food-products">additional rules</a> if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>export composite food products to the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>want to check if your product counts as a composite food product</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">general guidance for businesses exporting to the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> listing for exporters and suppliers</h3>

<p>You need to be listed as an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/businesses-approved-to-export-to-the-eu">approved business</a> with the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> if you export food that contains <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Use a logistics hub to export or move your products</h3>

<p>You can use a logistics hub to export or move <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Using a logistics hub can save you time by speeding up border processes. It does this by providing a central point for exports and expert staff in one location.</p>

<p>A logistics hub can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consolidate your batch of products with others from different suppliers into a single consignment</li>
  <li>collect your products and transport them to their destination in the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> or Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>complete and process the EHCs for your products - including access to a certifying officer</li>
  <li>provide a customs brokerage service</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all logistics hubs offer the same services. Contact your logistics company or email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:exports@apha.gov.uk">exports@apha.gov.uk</a> to find out more about logistics hubs.</p>

<p>Your products need to be accompanied by the relevant supporting documents when they arrive at the logistics hub. For example, if you’re exporting meat, you may need to provide evidence from the cutting plant or slaughterhouse that shows the geographical origin of the animal.</p>

<p>The certifying officer will need to check these documents before they can certify the <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Contact the logistics hub to find out what information you need to send with your products, and when you need to send it.</p>

<h2>Prohibited and restricted goods</h2>

<p><abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> rules mean you cannot export the following goods to the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chilled minced meat (red meat)</li>
  <li>chilled meat preparations (for example, raw sausages)</li>
  <li>minced poultry meat</li>
  <li>mechanically separated meat from poultry, ratite and game birds</li>
  <li>raw milk from TB herds</li>
  <li>ungraded eggs</li>
  <li>composite products containing dairy products made from unpasteurised milk (for example, a ready meal topped with unpasteurised cheese)</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot re-export certain animal and animal products including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fresh meat originally from the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> or non-<abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> countries</li>
  <li>milk not from the UK</li>
  <li>products using products of animal origin from non-<abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> countries that are not listed by the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> for the purpose of imports into the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>You can move the following prohibited and restricted meat products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland:</p>

<ul>
  <li>frozen or chilled minced meat of poultry, ratites and wild game birds</li>
  <li>chilled minced meat from animals other than poultry</li>
  <li>chilled meat preparations</li>
  <li>any unprocessed meat produced from meat initially imported into Great Britain from the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You must make sure the meat products:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enter Northern Ireland through a designated point of entry as directed by the point of entry authority</li>
  <li>are sold exclusively to end consumers in supermarkets located in Northern Ireland - they must not be sold to other operators in the food chain</li>
  <li>are packed for end consumers and have a label reading “These products from the United Kingdom may not be sold outside Northern Ireland”</li>
  <li>are accompanied by a prohibited and restricted export health certificate</li>
  <li>meet <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> standards (for example, the meat product must be from the UK or an approved non-<abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> third country)</li>
</ul>

<p>You need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/articles/pre-notification-arrival-consignments-northern-ireland-point-entry-gb" rel="external">Common Health Entry Document (CHED) on Traces</a> to pre-notify the point of entry</li>
  <li>a prohibited and restricted (P and R) <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr> for each consignment of these goods</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates">export health certificate (<abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr>) finder</a> and apply for a certificate for your product.</p>

<p>You’ll need a certificate for each product type, rather than for each lorry.</p>

<p>Each certificate must be signed by an official veterinarian (<abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr>).</p>

<p>You’ll be eligible for financial support toward the cost of P and R <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr> certificates. Your <abbr title="official veterinarian">OV</abbr> can invoice the government for costs up to £150.00 (+ VAT) per <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr>, as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/movement-assistance-scheme-get-help-with-moving-agrifood-goods-to-northern-ireland">Movement Assistance Scheme (MAS)</a>.</p>

<h2>Checks at <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> Border Control Posts (BCPs) or point(s) of entry in NI</h2>

<p>You must get food and drink that contains <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> checked at an <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> or point of entry in NI.</p>

<p>These checks are made to protect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>animal health and welfare</li>
  <li>public health</li>
</ul>

<p>Your goods may be refused entry, seized, destroyed or returned to GB if they arrive at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a port in the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> without a <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> where checks cannot be carried out</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> that cannot check your type of product</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> without the correct documentation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Find the correct <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> for your goods</h3>

<p>You must find a <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> that accepts your type of goods as not all BCPs accept all goods.</p>

<p>You’ll need to consider how to redirect your trade route if needed.</p>

<p>There are more than 400 BCPs in the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> and they’re usually at <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> ports and airports.</p>

<h3>Give advance notice to <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> BCPs or point(s) of entry in NI</h3>

<p>You’ll need to give <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> BCPs or points of entry in NI advance notice of goods arriving.</p>

<p>Check with the <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> or point of entry you’re planning to use for how much notice is needed.</p>

<p>Contact your import agent in the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> or NI to make sure they notify the <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> through <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System¶">TRACES</abbr> of the arrival of the consignment.</p>

<p>They must do this within the time limits set out by the <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> or point of entry.</p>

<h2>What happens if your goods fail inspection at an <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If your goods fail inspection because of risks to animal or public health, they will be destroyed immediately. If the goods fail for other reasons, the <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify your importer or agent</li>
  <li>ask them to decide whether your goods should be destroyed or returned to Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> will not usually contact you directly.</p>

<h3>Return food products containing <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> rejected at <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> BCPs</h3>

<p>Consignments of food products that contain <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> rejected at <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> BCPs may, subject to a risk assessment, re-enter Great Britain through any point of entry.</p>

<p>You’ll need to provide certain documents to return your rejected goods.</p>

<p>Officials from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency¶">APHA</abbr>) will carry out the risk assessment and notify you if the returned consignment needs to enter through a Great Britain <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> or through any point of entry.</p>

<h3>Documents you need to return your rejected food products containing <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Email <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency¶">APHA</abbr> Centre for International Trade (CIT) at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:imports@apha.gov.uk">imports@apha.gov.uk</a> to return a consignment. State that the message relates to the return of a consignment.</p>

<p>Attach these documents to the email:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a declaration from the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> describing the reason for refusal of entry</li>
  <li>full details of destination in Great Britain and the intended use or destruction of the returned consignment from the person responsible for the consignment</li>
  <li>the original export certificate for the returned product</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to provide a commercial invoice or similar to verify that the returned consignment is the one that was exported, if the consignment did not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>require a veterinary certificate</li>
  <li>have a certificate for export</li>
</ul>

<p>If the consignment was not originally exported in a sealed container or where the seal is broken for official control purposes, you must have an official declaration from the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> stating the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>place and date of unloading and reloading of the consignment</li>
  <li>consignment did not undergo any handling other than unloading, storage and reloading</li>
  <li>products were handled only to the extent necessary for the purposes of official controls at the appropriate temperature</li>
  <li>unloading and reloading of the consignment was handled hygienically to avoid cross-contamination</li>
  <li>consignment was stored under hygienic conditions at the required temperature and not at risk of cross contamination</li>
  <li>effective measures were put in place to avoid the contamination of the <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> with disease agents which cause transmissible animal diseases during the unloading, storage and re-loading in the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> country</li>
  <li>place of any unloading, storage and re-loading in the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> country was not subject to animal health movement restrictions due to transmissible animal diseases during the unloading, storage and re-loading</li>
</ul>

<p>If the rejected product was originally exported in a sealed container and maintained an intact original seal, you must have a declaration by the person responsible for the consignment stating:</p>

<ul>
  <li>since the product was originally exported, the storage and transport conditions have been complied with</li>
  <li>that the content of the consignment has not been altered</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency¶">APHA</abbr> will assess this information to decide the conditions of import and if the consignment can be returned through any point of entry or will have to enter through a <abbr title="Border control post¶">BCP</abbr> in Great Britain.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency¶">APHA</abbr> will issue you with a written authorisation. The consignment cannot be returned until you have received this authorisation. You must comply with the conditions of the authorisation.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:imports@apha.gov.uk">imports@apha.gov.uk</a> email address is monitored Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 5pm (excluding public holidays).</p>

<h2>Export or move vegetables, fruit and other plants used as food</h2>

<p>You may need a phytosanitary certificate (PC) to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-plants-seeds-bulbs-and-wood-special-rules">export fruit, vegetables, plants and plant products used as food</a>.</p>

<h2>Arrangements for authorised traders moving food from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>An arrangement is in place which allows authorised traders such as supermarkets and their trusted suppliers to move some goods without the need for official certification.</p>

<p>If you’re an authorised trader moving products of animal origin from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, you do not need official certification, such as export health certificates, phytosanitary certificates or marketing standards certification. However, if you’re moving prohibited or restricted goods to Northern Ireland you need to apply for an export health certificate.</p>

<p>The following conditions will be attached to these arrangements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods are packaged for end consumers and they bear a label reading “These products from the United Kingdom may not be marketed outside Northern Ireland”</li>
  <li>they are destined solely for sale to end consumers in supermarkets located in Northern Ireland, and they cannot be sold to other operators of the food chain</li>
  <li>they are accompanied by a simplified official certificate globally stating the products meet all the import requirements of <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> legislation</li>
  <li>they enter Northern Ireland through a designated point of entry, where they are submitted to a systematic documentary check and to a risk-based identity check on a selection of items in the means of transport
they are monitored through a channelling procedure applicable from the designated point of entry to the destination supermarket in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h3>Authorised traders</h3>
<p>Authorised traders are supermarkets and their trusted suppliers. The UK government will not discriminate against smaller suppliers or between different companies in recognising traders as authorised for the purpose of this arrangement.</p>

<p>A trusted supplier is any business that independently moves its products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, for sale in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>For example, a meat pie supplier that moves its own products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, which delivers directly to a store for sale within Northern Ireland only would be eligible for authorised trader status.
However, a meat pie supplier that delivers products to a supermarket distribution centre in Great Britain, which is then moved by the supermarket to Northern Ireland, the producer would not qualify. In this instance, the supermarket would be the authorised trader for that movement into Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>Export food and drink to non-<abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> countries</h2>

<p>You usually need to complete an <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr> and some supporting documents to export food that contains <abbr title="Product of animal origin¶">POAO</abbr> to non-<abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> countries.
You may also need a <a class="govuk-link" href="#certificate-free-sale">certificate of free sale</a> if you’re exporting processed food or drink. The food authority in the country you’re exporting to will tell you if you need one.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates">export health certificate (<abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr>) finder</a> to see if a certificate exists for your animal or product.</p>

<p>If you find an <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr>, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-export-health-certificate"><abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr> process to export</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot find an <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr> for your product, you’ll need to contact the competent authority in the <abbr title="European Union¶">EU</abbr> country you’re exporting to, in advance, to find out what:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paperwork you’ll need to fill in</li>
  <li>rules you need to comply with</li>
</ul>

<p>If the competent authority says that you need an <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr>, you’ll need to get their import conditions. Email the conditions to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency¶">APHA</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:exports@apha.gov.uk">exports@apha.gov.uk</a> who’ll arrange an <abbr title="Export Health Certificate¶">EHC</abbr> for you.</p>

<h2>Apply for a certificate of free sale</h2>

<p>To apply for a certificate of free sale you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>save a copy of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-for-certificates-of-free-sale-for-export">the application form</a> to your computer</li>
  <li>fill in all relevant parts, then email it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:trader@rpa.gov.uk">trader@rpa.gov.uk</a>. Valid forms are processed within 5 working days of receiving them.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should allow 10 working days from sending your application to receiving your certificate(s) back. It’s free to apply and the certificates do not expire unless the country you’re exporting to specifies a time limit.</p>
