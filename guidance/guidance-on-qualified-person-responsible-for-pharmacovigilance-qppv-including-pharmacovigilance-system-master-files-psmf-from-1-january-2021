<p>From 1 January 2021, the following legal obligations will apply to holders of UK marketing authorisations (MA). These include those that cover the whole of the UK, or are specific to Northern Ireland or to Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland):</p>

<ul>
  <li>To operate a pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products.</li>
  <li>To have an appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance (<abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>) that resides and operates in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or the UK and is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products.</li>
  <li>To maintain and make available upon request a pharmacovigilance system master file (<abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr>) that describes the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products. The <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> must be accessible electronically or physically from the UK at the same site at which reports of suspected adverse reaction may be accessed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="guidance-on-the-uk-qppv-for-uk-authorised-products">Guidance on the UK <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> for UK authorised products</h2>
<p>For all UK <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr>, including those that cover the whole of the UK or are specific to Northern Ireland or to Great Britain, the marketing authorisation holder (<abbr title="marketing authorisation holder">MAH</abbr>) must have permanently and continuously at its disposal a <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> who resides and operates in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or the UK, and is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the pharmacovigilance system.</p>

<p>This is provided for by regulation 182 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (<abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr>).</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that cover the whole of the UK or are specific to Northern Ireland, the legal requirements concerning the qualifications and responsibilities of the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> that are outlined in Article 10 of the Commission Implementing Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 520/2012 (CIR) will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that are specific to Great Britain, legal requirements concerning the qualifications and responsibilities of the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> are outlined in paragraph 10 of <abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr> Schedule 12A (inserted by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit Regulations 2019), which mirrors Article 10 of CIR.</p>

<p>Statutory guidance concerning the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> for UK authorised products is described in the Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (<abbr title="Good Pharmacovigilance Practice">GVP</abbr>) Module I. This guidance will be supplemented by the ‘Exceptions and modifications to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> guidance on good pharmacovigilance practices that apply to UK marketing authorisation holders’, which will be published in due course.</p>

<p>There will be no temporary exemption as to the requirement to have a <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> who resides and operates in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or the UK and is responsible for the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products. This requirement applies from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3 id="national-contact-person-for-pharmacovigilance">National contact person for pharmacovigilance</h3>
<p>If you choose to establish a <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> who resides and operates in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, you must nominate a national contact person for pharmacovigilance who resides and operates in the UK and reports to the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>. This individual should have access to the reports of suspected adverse reactions referred to in regulation 187 of the HMRs and the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> for UK authorised products. The individual should be able to facilitate responses to pharmacovigilance queries raised by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, including via inspections.</p>

<p>There will be a temporary exemption in place which allows you 12 months from 1 January 2021 to appoint a national contact person for pharmacovigilance that resides and operates in the UK.  Further guidance on the process for notifying the details of the national contact person for pharmacovigilance to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will be published in due course.</p>

<h2 id="guidance-on-the-psmf-for-uk-authorised-products">Guidance on the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> for UK authorised products</h2>
<p>For all UK <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr>, including those that cover the whole of the UK or are specific to Northern Ireland or to Great Britain, the <abbr title="marketing authorisation holder">MAH</abbr> must maintain, and make available upon request of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, a <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> that describes the pharmacovigilance system for UK authorised products.</p>

<h3 id="psmf-location-and-accessibility">
<abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> location and accessibility</h3>
<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that cover the whole of the UK or are specific to Northern Ireland, the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> must be located either at the site in the European Union where the main pharmacovigilance activities are performed or at the site where the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> operates, in accordance with Article 7(1) of the CIR. The <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> must be accessible electronically at the same point in the UK from which the reports of suspected adverse reactions referred to in regulation 187 of the HMRs are accessible.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that are specific to Great Britain, the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> must be accessible electronically at the same point in the UK from which the reports of suspected adverse reactions referred to in regulation 187 of the HMRs are accessible.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> needs to be permanently and immediately available for inspection at the stated location in the UK.</p>

<h3 id="psmf-format-content-and-representation-of-pharmacovigilance-systems">
<abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> format, content and representation of pharmacovigilance systems</h3>
<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that cover the whole of the UK or are specific to Northern Ireland, the legal requirements concerning the format and content of the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> that are outlined in Chapter I of CIR will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that are specific to Great Britain, legal requirements concerning the format and content of the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> are outlined in Part 1 of Schedule 12A of <abbr title="The Human Medicines Regulations">HMR</abbr>, which mirrors Chapter I of CIR.</p>

<p>As the legal requirements concerning <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> format and content are identical for <abbr title="Marketing authorisations">MAs</abbr> that cover the whole of the UK and Northern Ireland, and those that are specific to Great Britain, a single <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> can be used for all UK authorised products. This is assuming that the pharmacovigilance system applied to all products is the same.</p>

<p>Statutory guidance concerning the <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> for UK authorised products is described in <abbr title="Good Pharmacovigilance Practice">GVP</abbr> Module II. This guidance will be supplemented by the ‘Exceptions and modifications to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> guidance on good pharmacovigilance practices that apply to UK marketing authorisation holders’, which will be published in due course.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> must describe the global pharmacovigilance system and reflect the global availability of safety information for UK authorised products.</p>

<p>As per <abbr title="Good Pharmacovigilance Practice">GVP</abbr> Module II, there are different approaches to establishing a pharmacovigilance system. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr> can establish more than one pharmacovigilance system</li>
  <li>A pharmacovigilance system can be shared by several <abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> should be an accurate representation of the pharmacovigilance system that has been established and you must make sure that every pharmacovigilance system covering UK authorised products has been assigned a unique <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-request-a-uk-psmf-number">How to request a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number</h3>
<p>All <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master files">PSMFs</abbr> that cover UK authorised products should be registered with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. You should request a unique UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> for each pharmacovigilance system that you are operating for UK authorised products. Where the pharmacovigilance system is shared by several <abbr title="marketing authorisation holders">MAHs</abbr>, a single request for a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>A UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number can be requested via the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-submissions-to-the-mhra-in-a-no-deal-scenario" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Submissions Portal</a> from 1 January 2021. You should follow the online instructions for requesting a UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number and you should receive the number by email immediately upon completion of the form.</p>

<p>You are encouraged not to request the UK <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> number until you are notifying the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of a change in the details of the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> for UK authorised products from the baseline information held by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The baseline information will be the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> details that were registered in the eXtended EudraVigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary (<abbr title="eXtended Eudravigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary">XEVMPD</abbr>) on 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Further guidance regarding the notification of <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> and <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> details to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> for new and existing holders of UK marketing authorisations will be published in due course.</p>

<h2 id="queries">Queries</h2>
<p>General queries relating to the <abbr title="qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>, <abbr title="pharmacovigilance system master file">PSMF</abbr> and establishment of pharmacovigilance systems for UK authorised products should be sent to: <a href="mailto:gpvpinspectors@mhra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">gpvpinspectors@mhra.gov.uk</a></p>
