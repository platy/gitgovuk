<p>This checklist is designed for musical artists (such as soloists, groups and orchestras) and any accompanying staff (for example sound engineers) looking to work, perform or tour in an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea" class="govuk-link">EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein</a>.</p>

<p>Further information and support is available through the Export Support Service, which can be accessed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ask-export-support-team">online</a> or by calling the helpline on 0300 303 8955. UK businesses can use the service to get answers to practical questions about exporting products or services to Europe (including touring). It provides access to cross government information and support all in one place.</p>

<h2>1. Important checks</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are travelling to an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure your passport complies with the passport rules</li>
  <li>Ensure you have appropriate healthcare and travel insurance cover</li>
  <li>Carry your UK driving licence with you (if you are intending to drive)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a musical artist or accompanying staff travelling to work, perform or tour in an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you need to consider the extra requirements for travelling on business.</p>

</div>

<h2>2. Visa/work permits</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Many Member States have confirmed that they offer visa and work permit free routes for UK musicians, performers and support staff undertaking some short-term touring activities. Durations, definitions and requirements can vary from Member State to Member State. As a musical artist (which might include teaching and education roles) or as accompanying staff, we strongly recommend that before you travel you check domestic immigration rules for each European country you are intending to work, perform or tour in, as rules may vary depending on the length of your stay and the type of activity.</p>

</div>

<h2>3. Transporting musical instruments or equipment</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Temporarily taking musical instruments or equipment to the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein</strong></p>

<p>If you are taking your musical instrument or equipment temporarily out of the UK to work, perform or tour in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you will need to check the customs requirements for each country you are visiting.</p>

<p>If your musical instruments or equipment are in your baggage or a vehicle (‘accompanied’ – carried or taken by an individual in their personal baggage, or a vehicle, which travel with the individual throughout their journey), you may be able to use a temporary admission procedure in the country of destination, to pay no duty on them by going through the green or ‘nothing to declare’ channel, or by making an oral declaration for musical instruments and equipment to a Border Official. This may mean an ATA Carnet is not required in these circumstances. You can do this if your musical instruments or equipment are for personal or business use.</p>

<p>If your musical instruments or equipment aren’t accompanied (‘unaccompanied’ - moved as freight by a haulier and/or transport operator where the individual is not present), you can use an ATA Carnet as a temporary admission procedure (there is a cost for this).</p>

<p>If you don’t use a temporary admission procedure by going through the green channel, by declaring your goods orally, or by using an ATA Carnet, you may have to declare your musical instruments or equipment and pay duties on them according to the customs rules in the country of destination, every time you take them through customs.</p>

<p><strong>Musical instruments and props that contain endangered species (CITES)</strong></p>

<p>Musical artists looking to transport a musical instrument or props containing protected materials, such as ivory or some timber species (mahogany, ebony etc.), must be accompanied by a CITES certificate.</p>

<p>You need to use a designated port of exit and entry when transporting these goods.</p>

<p>You can apply for a musical instrument certificate (MIC) if you are moving musical instruments containing CITES specimens across international borders several times. MICs are free and last for three years.</p>

<p>Fees may apply for the movement of other items that require certificates or permits, such as props containing CITES specimens.</p>

<p><strong>Returning to the UK</strong></p>

<h2>4. Transporting commercial goods including merchandise</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are taking commercial goods in your baggage to the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, to sell (for example merchandise), you must check the customs requirements in the country you’re travelling to. You’ll also need to declare your goods to customs according to the customs rules in the country of destination.</p>

<p>If you are bringing commercial goods into Great Britain (excluding returning goods) that are not classed as controlled goods, valued below £1,500 and weigh less than 1000kg you can make an oral declaration to a Border Force Officer at the port if facilities exist; or use HMRC’s simple online declaration service before coming into Great Britain. If you are bringing commercial goods into Great Britain that exceed any of these limits, you will need to submit full customs declarations to HMRC which you can do yourself or by using a customs agent or intermediary.</p>

</div>

<h2>5. Road transportation</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are using a UK-based haulier (for example, as a promoter or tour manager) to transport your instruments, equipment or other goods to the EU, you will need to consider the movement restrictions on UK-based hauliers. Once in the EU, UK hauliers will be able to undertake up to two additional movements (cross-trade or cabotage) within the EU, with a maximum of 1 cabotage movement within a 7-day period. Cabotage must be within the same EU country where you first unloaded your goods brought into the EU.</p>

<p>If you are transporting both passengers and goods using touring vehicles known as ‘splitter vans’ you will not be subject to the movement restrictions on UK-based hauliers - this means you will be subject to Member State rules, as was the case before the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. If you use ‘splitter vans’ solely to transport goods, you will be subject to the movement restrictions on UK based hauliers.</p>

</div>

<h2>6. Social Security and Income Tax</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are only working or performing temporarily in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you may be able to get a certificate or document from HMRC to continue paying National Insurance contributions in the UK. This means you’ll not have to pay social security contributions abroad.</p>

<p>You may need to pay UK Income Tax on any foreign income you earn from working or performing in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.</p>
