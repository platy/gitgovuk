<h2 id="schools-duty-to-provide-remote-education">Schools’ duty to provide remote education</h2>

<p>Where a pupil, class, group or small number of pupils need to self-isolate, or there is a local lockdown requiring pupils to remain at home, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> expects schools to be able to immediately offer them access to remote education. Schools should ensure remote education, where needed, is high-quality and aligns as closely as possible with in-school provision.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has given a temporary continuity direction in order to require schools to provide remote education for state-funded, school-age children unable to attend school due to coronavirus (COVID-19). This came into effect on Thursday 22 October 2020. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/remote-education-temporary-continuity-direction-explanatory-note" class="govuk-link">remote education temporary continuity direction explanatory note</a> for more information. The direction poses no additional expectations on the quality of remote education expected of schools beyond those set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools" class="govuk-link">guidance for schools</a> published in June.</p>

<h2 id="remote-education-expectations-for-further-education">Remote education expectations for further education</h2>

<p>As outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-further-education-provision/what-fe-colleges-and-providers-will-need-to-do-from-the-start-of-the-2020-autumn-term" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> autumn term guidance</a>, <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> providers can continue with remote education if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complements the overall offer</li>
  <li>does not undermine the quality of education and engagement</li>
  <li>counts for the minority of planned hours for all 16 to 19-year-old students</li>
</ul>

<p>In exceptional circumstances where restrictions are put in place to contain local outbreaks or students are required to self-isolate, remote provision can be extended to meet students’ needs. <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> providers should have contingency plans in place to move quickly to blended or, if necessary, remote education should the need arise.</p>

<h2 id="school-to-school-support-for-coronavirus-covid-19-recovery">School-to-school support for coronavirus (COVID-19) recovery</h2>

<p>The government is also funding school-to-school support for schools that need particular help with coronavirus (COVID-19) recovery, which can include support to develop remote education provision. System leaders in education provide support for an average of 5 days and in line with the current coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance for schools.</p>

<h2 id="catch-up-support">Catch-up support</h2>

<p>To support pupils from falling behind, schools can spend their catch-up premium on contingency planning for remote education, for example purchasing additional devices or more textbooks.</p>
