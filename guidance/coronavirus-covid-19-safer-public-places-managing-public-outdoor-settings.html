<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>The government has announced that the measures put in place under Plan B in England will be lifted.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The government is no longer asking people to work from home if they can. People should now talk to their employers to agree arrangements to return to the office.</li>
  <li>From 20 January: Face coverings will no longer be advised for staff and pupils in secondary school and college classrooms.</li>
  <li>From 27 January: Face coverings will no longer be advised for staff and pupils in communal areas of secondary schools, nor for staff in communal areas of primaries.</li>
  <li>From 27 January: There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</li>
  <li>From 27 January: Venues and events will no longer be required by law to check visitorsâ€™ NHS COVID Pass. The NHS COVID Pass can still be used on a voluntary basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance will be updated shortly to include more information on these changes. You should continue to follow all of the guidance on this page to keep yourself and others safe.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As of 19 July, this guidance replaced the following pieces of government safer public places guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>COVID-19: safer public places - urban centres and green spaces</li>
  <li>COVID-19: guidance for managing playgrounds and outdoor gyms</li>
  <li>COVID-19: guidance for managing beaches, the countryside and coastal areas</li>
  <li>COVID-19: guidance to support local authority compliance and enforcement activity, including COVID-19 Secure Marshalsâ€¯</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance includes key principles and other information local authorities, owners and operators should continue to consider to support the safe use and management of outdoor public places while the risk of COVID-19 transmission remains.</p>

<p>This guidance includes considerations for the following spaces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>urban centres</li>
  <li>green spaces</li>
  <li>outdoor playgrounds</li>
  <li>outdoor gyms</li>
  <li>tourist hotspots, including beaches, the countryside and coastal areas</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance is only applicable in England and should be considered alongside local public health and safety requirements. For advice to local authorities, landowners, commercial landlords responsible for public places and management companies in other parts of the UK, please see guidance for <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20200629122259/http://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-public-spaces-scotland-urban-centres-green-spaces/">Scotland</a>, <a href="https://gov.wales/creating-safer-public-places-coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Wales</a> and <a href="https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/publications/guidance-urban-centres-and-green-spaces-covid-19" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance is non-statutory and does not affect any existing legal obligations, such as health and safety requirements.</p>

<h2>Principles for individuals</h2>

<p>Local authorities, owners and operators should be aware of and should consider advice provided to the public and individuals on how to protect themselves and others during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. This includes meeting outdoors where possible as airborne transmission is a very significant way that COVID-19 circulates. See more information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">key principles for individuals to help minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission</a>.</p>

<h2>Social distancing</h2>

<p>Social distancing rules will no longer apply in law. This means that local authorities, owners and operators do not need to implement social distancing (2m or 1m+) in outdoor public places, and the public do not need to keep apart from people they donâ€™t live with. However, local authorities, owners and operators may wish to consider that some may make a personal choice and limit their close contact.</p>

<p>Local authorities, owners and operators may also wish to consider that businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to those affected by their business and will therefore take reasonable steps to mitigate risks they identify and decide which interventions are appropriate to adopt.</p>

<p>See more information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">how people can stay safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>Face coverings are required by law in most indoor public places and on public transport.</p>

<p>Face coverings are not required in hospitality venues where food and drink are consumed (such as pubs, cafÃ©s and restaurants), or during exercise (such as gyms), including dancing (such as nightclubs).</p>

<p>Where a premises or part of a premises is being used for an event where the main activities include eating, drinking and dancing, face coverings are not required. Face coverings must be worn in communal areas of the premises not being used for the event, such as in a hotel lobby when an event is taking place in a conference room.</p>

<p>In indoor settings where a face covering is not legally required, people should still continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with other people they do not normally meet.
Some people, including children under 11, are exempt from having to wear face coverings in any setting.</p>

<p>Furthermore, anyone with a health condition or disability, which means they cannot wear a face covering, has a reasonable excuse for not wearing a face covering.</p>

<p>More information, including the full list of settings where face coverings are required or not, can be found in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">Face coverings: when to wear one, exemptions, and how to make your own</a>.</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>COVID-19 spreads through small droplets, aerosols and direct contact. Surfaces and belongings can be contaminated with COVID-19 when people with the infection touch them or cough, talk or breathe over them.</p>

<p>Viruses on a surface could infect another person if they touch the surface and then touch their eyes, nose and mouth. Cleaning surfaces will reduce the amount of contamination and so reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>The more a surface is cleaned, the more likely you are to remove viruses from an infected surface before you or another person touches it.</p>

<p>Local authorities, owners and operators responsible for outdoor public places should consider implementingâ€¯or retainingâ€¯cleaningâ€¯protocols to limit coronavirus transmission in public places with particular focus on touch points (e.g. handrails and gates).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste#cleaning-waste" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus (COVID-19): disposing of waste in non-healthcare settings</a></p>

    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">COVID-19: cleaning of non-healthcare settings outside the home</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Hygiene</h2>

<p>Washing or sanitising hands removes viruses and other germs, so people are less likely to become infected if they touch their face. Using soap and water is the most effective way to clean hands, especially if they are visibly dirty. Hand sanitiser can be used when soap and water is not available.</p>

<p>Local authorities, owners and operators responsible for public places, for example public toilets, should     consider the use of signs and posters to make people aware of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how to wash their hands well</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that they should wash their hands frequentlyâ€¯</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where possible, avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth. If they do need to touch their face (for example to put on or take off your face covering), wash or sanitise their hands before and after</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that they should cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into their arms if a tissue is not available</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When providing regular reminders and signage to maintain hygiene standards, local authorities, owners and operators may wish to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>addressing different needs of multiple user groups, for example, young people, older people andâ€¯people with disabilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>using simple, clear and accessible images and messaging to explain guidelines, with consideration for groups whose first language may not be English or where alternative formats may be required</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Toilets</h2>

<p>Toilets should be kept open and carefully managed to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Steps should be taken by local authorities, owners and operators to make the use of toilets as safe as possible, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using signs and posters (see Hygiene above)</li>
  <li>making hand sanitiser available on entry to toilets where safe, practical and accessible</li>
  <li>ensuring suitable handwashing facilities are available. This includes running water and liquid soap and suitable options for drying. Namely paper towels, continuous roller towels or hand dryers. Consideration should be given to the needs of people with disabilities</li>
  <li>setting clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets, with increased frequency of cleaning in line with usage. Normal cleaning products should be used and attention paid to frequently touched surfaces. Disposable cloths or paper roll to clean all hard surfaces should be considered</li>
  <li>keeping facilities well ventilated, for example by ensuring extractor fans work effectively and opening windows and vents where possible</li>
  <li>special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets and larger toilet blocks</li>
  <li>following and putting up a cleaning schedule that is kept up to date and visible</li>
  <li>providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collection</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities, owners and operators should also be aware of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: ventilation of indoor spaces guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Keeping staff safe</h2>

<p>Local authorities, owners and operators should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance on working safely</a>.</p>

<h2>Role of marshals</h2>

<p>Local authoritiesâ€¯can determine whether to useâ€¯marshals, stewards or their equivalentsâ€¯for on-goingâ€¯support.â€¯These staff can provide in-person advice and supportâ€¯to businesses and to the public. For example, this could be considered as part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/containing-and-managing-local-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreaks/covid-19-contain-framework-a-guide-for-local-decision-makers">local outbreak management planning</a> in areas of higher risk, or where there is demand from businesses or the public locally for this type of intervention.â€¯</p>

<h2>Events and NHS COVID Pass</h2>

<p>For events that could take place in or interact with outdoor public settings, local authorities, owners and operators should consult the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions guidance</a> which is included as part of the guidance on working safely. This guide is designed to helpâ€¯organisersâ€¯reduce the risk from COVID-19 during theirâ€¯events.â€¯The guide also aims to assist local authorities in England in ensuring thatâ€¯eventsâ€¯are able to go ahead as safely as possible.</p>

<p>Owners, operators and local authorities should be aware from 15 December, certain venues and events will be required by law to check that all visitors aged 18 years or over are fully vaccinated, have proof of a negative test in the last 48 hours or that they have an exemption. This means that those aged 18 years or over must show their NHS COVID Pass, or an alternative proof of a negative test result, such as an NHS Test and Trace email or text proof, to gain entry into these venues or events.</p>

<p>Event organisers, venues and businesses should consider where a queue may interact with the public realm and engage with the local authority, owner or operator of that public space in order to manage queuing arrangements safely and effectively.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the use of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID Pass</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carrying-out-mandatory-covid-19-status-checks-at-your-venue-or-event" class="govuk-link">legal requirements for organisations</a>.</p>

<h2>Pavement licences</h2>

<p>The Business and Planning Act 2020 included a temporary streamlined and cheaper route for businesses such as cafes, restaurants and bars to secure a licence to place furniture on the highway. In March 2021 the government announced this would be extended for a further 12 months. This is a streamlined process to allow businessesâ€¯to secure these licences and where they are deemed to have been granted, allow these licences to remain in place for a year but not beyond 30 September 2022.â€¯</p>

<p>Where a pavement licence is granted, clear access routes on the highway will need to be maintained, taking into account the needs of all users, including disabled people. See guidance on pavement licenses:â€¯</p>

</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Local authorities, owners and operators of public places are advised to consider protective security advice in a number of settings and scenarios. This applies especially if an area is busy, or if there are temporary or newly implemented measures that impact outdoor public places, such as changes to entrances or exits and queue management systems.</p>

<p>Guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/crowded-places-guidance" class="govuk-link">crowded places</a> has been developed which covers key forms of protective security â€“ physical, personnel, cyber and personal â€“ and helps give guidance on how owners and operators can act to help make public places safer.</p>

<h2>Tourist areas</h2>
<p>It is noted that tourist areas, such as beaches, the countryside and coastal areas, may experience high footfall during the coronavirus pandemic. This section includes information to support local authorities, owners and operators in managing these areas.</p>

<p>A high volume of visitors to outdoor public places for exercise and outdoor recreation may create an increase in incidents of anti-social behaviour such as littering, public defecation/urination, drug use and drunk and disorderly behaviour.</p>

<h3>Car parking</h3>
<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-enforcement-of-parking-contraventions/guidance-for-local-authorities-on-enforcing-parking-restrictions">guidance for local authorities on enforcing parking restrictions</a>, to maintain access for emergency services, residentsâ€™ vehicles and pedestrians.</p>

<p>Local authorities may wish to consider how temporary changes to permitted development rights can support car parking management in their areas. Government has allowed up to 56 days for the temporary use of land in 2021 through a time-limited permitted development right. This could be useful to alleviate pressure on existing on-street and off-street parking when visitor numbers are expected to be higher than normal.</p>

<p>Local authorities also have duties placed on them through legislation to provide safe movement for all traffic and permitted development rights do not override the need for relevant highways requirements. Further information on the temporary changes can be found below.</p>
