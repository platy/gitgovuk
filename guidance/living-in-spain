<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residency-requirements-in-spain" class="govuk-link">register as a Spanish resident</a> if you want to stay in Spain for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>You will get a green A4 certificate or credit card-sized piece of paper from Extranjeria or the police.</p>

<h3 id="residency-after-brexit">Residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, and you are resident in Spain before the end of the implementation period you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>If you arrive in Spain before the end of the implementation period, you will be able to register as resident in Spain under the current rules, and will have your right to residence in Spain protected for as long as you remain resident.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<p>In some parts of Spain, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals are currently unable to register as a resident as appointments are not available. If you donâ€™t yet have a residence certificate, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/brexit/howtoprepare/Paginas/190108residence.aspx" class="govuk-link">residency advice on the Moncloa website</a> is to make sure you have proof you were living here before Brexit (such as padrÃ³n registration or a rental contract), and to keep checking the online appointment system for new appointments.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, any <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national residing in Spain before the date the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves will be considered legally resident for a period of 21 months, irrespective of whether they currently hold a residency document.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-spain" class="govuk-link">register for healthcare</a> as a resident in Spain.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on who can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-spain-including-the-balearic-and-canary-islands" class="govuk-link">access healthcare in Spain and how to register</a>.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Spain and receive an exportable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance (ESA) or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are entitled to an S1, you are also entitled to apply for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. If you are not an S1 holder, but are registered for public healthcare in Spain in another way and are travelling outside of Spain, you must <a rel="external" href="https://w6.seg-social.es/solTse/jsp/Entrada.jsp" class="govuk-link">apply for a Tarjeta Sanitaria Europea (<abbr title="Tarjeta Sanitaria Europea">TSE</abbr> - a Spanish-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) online (in Spanish)</a>, or go to your nearest <a rel="external" href="http://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/OficinaSeguridadSocial" class="govuk-link">social security office (Insitituto Nacional de la Seguridad Social)</a>.</p>

<p>You must also buy comprehensive travel insurance to cover anything not covered by your <abbr title="Tarjeta Sanitaria Europea">TSE</abbr>, <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or for travel to countries outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Spain, you must not use your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to access healthcare in Spain.</p>

<p>When you travel from Spain for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare in the country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">read our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights to healthcare in Spain will remain the same, as long as you remain covered by the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Spain have each taken steps to ensure that people living in each country can continue to access healthcare as they do now until at least 31 December 2020. If you are living in Spain and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> currently pays for your healthcare, for example you are an S1 form holder, your healthcare access will remain the same after the day the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> until at least December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are an S1 holder your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid for travel to other European member states. You must ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Spain</a>.</p>

<h3 id="children-travelling-from-spain">Children travelling from Spain</h3>

<p>The Spanish Secretary of State for Security has published a regulation (InstrucciÃ³n NÃºm. 10/2019) which states that from 1 September 2019, children (under the age of 18 years old) resident in Spain may need a certified authorisation by the person with parental responsibility if the child is travelling out of Spain without a person with parental responsibility. This is in addition to a valid travel document.</p>

<p>The Spanish Authorities have confirmed that the above regulation is not applicable to foreign minors resident in Spain who are subject to the law of their country of nationality or to non-resident foreign minors visiting Spain. The British Embassy has notified the Spanish immigration authorities that there is no similar standard regulation in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> therefore British consulates do not provide travel authorisation documents. It is not customary for British minors to require written permission to travel unless the minor is subject to a court order, which specifically mentions that written permission is required from those holding parental responsibility for the minor. If the minor is subject to such a court order, or if you wish to ensure that an unaccompanied minor will be able to leave Spain without delay when passing through Spanish immigration, you will have to obtain the certified authorisation from a <a rel="external" href="https://notaries-directory.eu/en" class="govuk-link">public notary</a> in Spain.</p>

<p>Those with parental responsibility of Spanish children in Spain can obtain a certified authorisation at a Notary, <a rel="external" href="https://sede.policia.gob.es/portalCiudadano/normativa/declaracion_permiso_viaje_menores.pdf" class="govuk-link">national police station (in Spanish)</a>, or at the <a rel="external" href="http://www.guardiacivil.es/en/servicios/Procedimientos_administrativos/Permiso_para_salida_de_menores_al_extranjero.html" class="govuk-link">Guardia Civil (in Spanish)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals will not need visas for short stays</a> elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180-day period. You must retain evidence of travel (such as train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-spain">Driving in Spain</h2>

<p>If you are resident in Spain, <a rel="external" href="https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/permisos-de-conducir/canje-permisos/canje-permisos-extranjeros/canje-renovacion-sustitucion-uk/canje-permisos-uk/index.shtml" class="govuk-link">exchange your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licence for a Spanish one</a>.

<p>If you hold an old <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licence that doesnâ€™t have a 10-year validity period, you must renew or exchange it for a Spanish licence once youâ€™ve been a resident in Spain for 2 years.</p>

<p>If you are in Spain and your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licence is lost, stolen or expires, you will not be able to renew it with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>). You will need to apply to the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> for a â€˜certificate of entitlementâ€™ in Spanish to be able to apply for a Spanish driving licence.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a double-taxation agreement with Spain to make sure that people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. You can ask the relevant tax authority about double-taxation relief.</p>

<p>As a Spanish resident, you must declare your global income to the Spanish authorities, no matter which country it came from. If you are not a resident, you will only pay tax on income that came from Spain.</p>
