<h2>Evidence of identity</h2>

<p>You must provide <abbr title="where any of the persons or parties named in the relevant panels of the application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1 are not legally represented, you must also provide evidence of identity using form ID1 or form ID2 for each such person or party">evidence of identity</abbr> for any party (and the person lodging the application if different) who is not <abbr title="when you are represented by a ‘conveyancer’">legally represented</abbr>.</p>

<p>The evidence must be in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a> and must be completed by each individual person who is a party to the above transactions who is not <abbr title="when you are represented by a ‘conveyancer’">legally represented</abbr>. This requirement applies to both private individuals and corporate bodies such as companies.</p>

<p>Both forms can be downloaded free of charge from our website or by phoning <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry/about/access-and-opening#phone">customer support</a>.</p>

<p>Both parts of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a> lodged in support of an application must be dated and signed no more than three months before the time of lodgement.</p>

<p>Note: Our normal requirement is for both parts of an ID form and the photograph to be no more than 3 months old at the time of lodgement but this has been extended temporarily to 6 months until further notice because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

<p>Completed forms ID1 and ID2 are not open to public inspection and normally a person may not apply for an official copy of them. There are special provisions in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registration-rules-2003">Land Registration Rules 2003</a> to allow inspection by specific persons, in some situations connected with court proceedings, insolvency and tax liability investigations. We hope that you will understand why <abbr title="where any of the persons or parties named in the relevant panels of the application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1 are not legally represented, you must also provide evidence of identity using form ID1 or form ID2 for each such person or party">evidence of identity</abbr> is needed. Although this requirement may appear to be a burden we believe it is essential to help combat identity theft and fraud. Our requirements are similar to the identity checks made by other organisations, including banks.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Fraud notice</h4>
<p><br>
If, when there is a requirement to confirm identity or provide evidence of identity, you dishonestly provide information or make a statement that you know is, or might be, untrue or misleading, and intend by doing so to make a gain for yourself or another person, or to cause loss or the risk of loss to another person, you may commit the offence of fraud under section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006, the maximum penalty for which is 10 years’ imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>There are some exceptions, which are set out in full in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-of-identity-conveyancers">practice guide 67: <abbr title="where any of the persons or parties named in the relevant panels of the application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1 are not legally represented, you must also provide evidence of identity using form ID1 or form ID2 for each such person or party">evidence of identity</abbr> - conveyancers</a>. The main exceptions affecting applications sent by someone who is not a professional <abbr title="a person authorised by law to provide conveyancing services referred to in the Legal Services Act 2007, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities, and includes solicitors and licensed conveyancers">conveyancer</abbr> where we do not need <abbr title="this is done by completing the relevant panels in application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1">confirmation of identity</abbr> for some or all parties are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lease or a charge which is merely being noted in the register</li>
  <li>voluntary applications for first registration unless the title deeds have been lost or destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also do not require <abbr title="this is done by completing the relevant panels in application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1">confirmation of identity</abbr> for certain parties who already have to send us evidence of their appointment. This includes personal representatives (executors or administrators of a deceased person’s estate), trustees in bankruptcy, liquidators and Mental Capacity Act deputies (a full list is in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-of-identity-conveyancers">practice guide 67: <abbr title="where any of the persons or parties named in the relevant panels of the application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1 are not legally represented, you must also provide evidence of identity using form ID1 or form ID2 for each such person or party">evidence of identity</abbr> - conveyancers</a>). This exemption applies both when they are parties to a deed, and when they are also sending the affected application to us themselves.</p>

<p>Please note though that <abbr title="this is done by completing the relevant panels in application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1">confirmation of identity</abbr> is still required for the beneficiary under an assent (except in the case where someone is assenting the property to themselves) or the transferee under a transfer, and also for any person lodging the application (unless they are the executor, trustee in bankruptcy etc as referred to in the above paragraph). This applies both in situations where the land is already registered and also where an application is being made for compulsory first registration. In addition to the above we also do not require <abbr title="this is done by completing the relevant panels in application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1">confirmation of identity</abbr> where the true value of the land involved in the disposal <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/completing-the-evidence-of-identity-panels-on-forms-ap1-fr1-ds2">does not exceed £6,000</a>.</p>

<h2>Completing the ID forms</h2>

<p>Private individuals must complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a>, corporate bodies must complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a>.</p>

<p>Where a party to a transaction comprises more than one person, each one must complete a separate ID form and produce evidence of their identity.</p>

<p>The following examples help to illustrate when <abbr title="where any of the persons or parties named in the relevant panels of the application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1 are not legally represented, you must also provide evidence of identity using form ID1 or form ID2 for each such person or party">evidence of identity</abbr> is required and for whom.</p>

<ul>
  <li>neighbour A sells part of his back garden to neighbour B. Neither use a <abbr title="a person authorised by law to provide conveyancing services referred to in the Legal Services Act 2007, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities, and includes solicitors and licensed conveyancers">conveyancer</abbr> and both are private individuals. Neighbour B then lodges the application for registration.</li>
</ul>

<p>We need separate forms ID1 from neighbour A as the transferor and neighbour B as the transferee.</p>

<ul>
  <li>C mortgages her property to D who applies to register the mortgage. Neither use a <abbr title="a person authorised by law to provide conveyancing services referred to in the Legal Services Act 2007, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities, and includes solicitors and licensed conveyancers">conveyancer</abbr> and both are private individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p>We need separate forms ID1 from C as borrower and D as lender.</p>

<ul>
  <li>E and F transfer their property by way of gift to G. H submits the application for registration on behalf of G. All are private individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will need separate forms ID1 for E and F as joint transferors, G as the transferee and H as the person lodging the application.</p>

<ul>
  <li>J, a company, discharges a mortgage and gives K, a private individual, a paper DS1. K lodges the discharge for registration.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will need <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a> for J and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a> for K.</p>

<ul>
  <li>L sells his house to M but appoints an attorney N to execute the transfer. M lodges the application for registration. L, M and N are all private individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will need separate forms ID1 for L, M and N.</p>

<p>You will need to take the identity evidence mentioned in section B3 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a> and a passport-size photograph with you taken in the last 3 months (you will need 2 copies of the photograph if you are going to a <abbr title="a person authorised by law to provide conveyancing services referred to in the Legal Services Act 2007, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities, and includes solicitors and licensed conveyancers">conveyancer</abbr>, because they will need a copy for their records). The photograph must be printed on photographic paper and your face must be clearly visible. ID forms may be rejected if this is not the case. .</p>

<p>If you have your identity verified by a <abbr title="a person authorised by law to provide conveyancing services referred to in the Legal Services Act 2007, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer.

<p>To come within the definition of <abbr title="a person authorised by law to provide conveyancing services referred to in the Legal Services Act 2007, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities, and includes solicitors and licensed conveyancers">conveyancer</abbr> in rule 217A of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registration-rules-2003">Land Registration Rules 2003</a> an individual must be authorised under the Legal Services Act 2007 to provide conveyancing services; in effect they must have a practicing certificate. If verification is given by a person who has made it clear on the ID form that they are retired or not practising, a requisition is likely to be raised. Paralegals are also unable to verify identity because they do not fall within the rule 217A definition of <abbr title="a person authorised by law to provide conveyancing services referred to in the Legal Services Act 2007, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities, and includes solicitors and licensed conveyancers">conveyancer</abbr>. Some Chartered Legal Executives are not conveyancers, but HM Land Registry has agreed that they can verify identity for Land Registration purposes.</p>

It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities, and includes solicitors and licensed conveyancers">conveyancer</abbr>, section B of the ID1 or ID2 should be completed and signed by a lawyer or notary public qualified to practice in the person’s country of residence. The form should be amended to include confirmation of the country in which the lawyer or notary public is qualified to practice, confirmation that they are so qualified to practice and the name and address of the body with which they are registered to practice.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">Form ID1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a> will always be required. The option in forms AP1, FR1 and DS2 that sufficient steps have been taken to verify someone’s identity cannot be used.</p>

<h3>Verification of identity by a serving officer of the UK armed forces operating overseas</h3>

<p>Where a member of the UK armed forces is serving overseas they can have their identity verified by an officer who is also serving with them overseas. In this situation the verifier must provide their passport number.</p>

<h3>Identity requirements where two or more applications are being lodged at the same time</h3>

<p>If you intend to lodge two or more applications at the same time, and at the same office, and the parties for those applications (who are not <abbr title="when you are represented by a ‘conveyancer’">legally represented</abbr>) are the same, you need provide only one set of identity evidence for each of those parties for all of the applications.</p>

<p>If the parties in the applications (who are not <abbr title="when you are represented by a ‘conveyancer’">legally represented</abbr>) are different, you will need identity evidence for each separate party.</p>

<h3>Identity requirements where applications are being lodged at different HM Land Registry local offices</h3>

<p>If you are lodging applications at different offices you will need to provide identity evidence for each application or batch of applications for each local office.</p>

<h2>Properties where the true value does not exceed £6,000</h2>

<p>You do not have to confirm the identity of persons involved in transactions where the true value of the land which is the subject of the disposal does not exceed £6,000. In these cases you may instead lodge a certificate by someone qualified to give property valuations confirming the value of the land, for example an estate agent, a surveyor, a land and property valuer or auctioneer who holds a qualification from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or some other person who is similarly qualified.</p>

<p>You may still supply <abbr title="where any of the persons or parties named in the relevant panels of the application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1 are not legally represented, you must also provide evidence of identity using form ID1 or form ID2 for each such person or party">evidence of identity</abbr> if you prefer, and we also reserve the right to require <abbr title="where any of the persons or parties named in the relevant panels of the application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1 are not legally represented, you must also provide evidence of identity using form ID1 or form ID2 for each such person or party">evidence of identity</abbr> in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a>, in any particular instance.</p>

<h2>Facility letter arrangements</h2>

<p>HM Land Registry has issued ‘facility letters’ for a limited number of people who regularly deal with HM Land Registry. These exempt these individuals from our normal identity requirements. A copy of the facility letter must be enclosed with any application where <abbr title="this is done by completing the relevant panels in application forms AP1, DS2 or FR1">confirmation of identity</abbr> is usually required, in place of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a>.</p>

<p>A facility letter can only be used where the value of the property does not exceed £100,000.</p>

<p>We are not be accepting applications for new facility letters until further notice.</p>

<h2>Send your forms</h2>

<p>Send the completed form(s) to our Citizen Centre, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/land-registry-address-for-applications#standard-addresses">HM Land Registry address for applications</a>.</p>
