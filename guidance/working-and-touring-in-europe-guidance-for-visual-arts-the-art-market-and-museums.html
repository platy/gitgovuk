<p>This checklist is designed for museum professionals, artists (or those involved in trading or exhibiting art) looking to work, travel between art fairs or tour in an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea" class="govuk-link">EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein</a>.</p>

<p>Further information and support is available through the Export Support Service, which can be accessed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ask-export-support-team">online</a> or by calling the helpline on 0300 303 8955. UK businesses can use the service to get answers to practical questions about exporting products or services to Europe (including touring). It provides access to cross government information and support all in one place.</p>

<h2>1. Important checks</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are travelling to an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure your passport complies with the passport rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure you have appropriate healthcare and travel insurance cover</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Carry your UK driving licence with you (if you are intending to drive)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a museum professional, artist or exhibitor looking to work, travel between art fairs or tour in an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you need to consider the extra requirements for travelling on business.</p>

</div>

<h2>2. Visa/work permits</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>As a museum professional, artist or exhibitor, you must check domestic immigration rules for each European country you are intending to work or tour in. Some countries allow for these activities without a visa or a work permit, but others will require one or both, or other documentation.</p>

<p>Some EU Member States use the terms ‘visa’ and ‘work permit’ interchangeably, sometimes with different meanings. We strongly recommend that you check domestic immigration rules for each European country you are intending to work, perform or tour in, as rules may vary depending on the length of your stay and the type of activity.</p>

<h2>3. Transporting works of art, cultural objects, or other objects for exhibition</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Temporarily taking works of art, cultural objects, or other objects for exhibition to the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein</strong></p>

<p>If you are taking your works of art, cultural objects, or other objects for exhibition temporarily out of the UK to exhibit in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you will need to consider the customs requirements for each country you are visiting.</p>

<p>If the works of art or objects are in your baggage or a vehicle accompanied (‘accompanied’ – carried or taken by an individual in their personal baggage, or a vehicle, which have been transported by the individual throughout the journey), you may be able to use a temporary admission procedure to pay no duty on them by going through the green or ‘nothing to declare’ channel. You can do this if the works of art or objects are for personal or business use.</p>

<p>If your objects aren’t accompanied (‘unaccompanied’ - moved as freight by a haulier and/or transport operator where the individual is not present), you’ll need to consider using other temporary admissions procedures. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an ATA Carnet – there is a cost for this</li>
  <li>a duplicate list – there is no cost</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t use an ATA Carnet, duplicate list, or other temporary admission procedures, you may have to declare your objects and pay duties on them according to the Customs rules in the country of destination, every time you take them through customs.</p>

<p>If you are exporting objects of cultural interest over a certain age and value threshold from the UK, you will need to obtain an export licence from Arts Council England.</p>

<p><strong>Works of art, cultural objects, or other objects for exhibition that contain endangered species (CITES)</strong></p>

<p>Artists, exhibitors and museum professionals looking to transport objects into the EU that contain endangered species or specimens, for example rosewood or ivory, must apply for a CITES permit or CITES certificate. You need to use a designated port of exit and entry when transporting these goods.</p>

<p><strong>Returning to the UK</strong></p>

<p>When you return to the UK, with cultural objects, you may be eligible for relief from import VAT and any customs duty under Returned Goods Relief, provided relevant conditions are met.</p>

<p>If you are a museum, gallery or a government agency such as an Arts Council or local council, you may be able to claim a relief to pay no Customs Duty and VAT on importing museum and gallery exhibits.</p>

<h2>4. Transporting commercial goods including merchandise</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are taking commercial goods in your baggage to the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, to sell or bringing them back to the UK to sell (for example merchandise or works of art), you must check the customs requirements in the country you’re travelling to. You’ll also need to declare your goods to customs.</p>

<p>If you are bringing commercial goods into Great Britain (excluding returning goods) that are not classed as controlled goods, valued below £1,500 and weigh less than 1000kg you can make an oral declaration to a Border Force Officer at the port if facilities exist; or use HMRC’s simple online declaration service before coming into Great Britain. If you are bringing commercial goods into Great Britain that exceed any of these limits, you will need to submit full customs declarations to HMRC which you can do yourself or by using a customs agent or intermediary.</p>

<h2>5. Haulage</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are using a UK-based haulier to transport cultural objects, artworks or other goods to the EU, you will need to consider the movement restrictions on UK-based hauliers. Once in the EU, UK hauliers will be able to undertake up to two additional movements (cross-trade or cabotage) within the EU, with a maximum of 1 cabotage movement within a 7-day period. Cabotage must be within the same EU country where you first unloaded your goods brought into the EU.</p>

<h2>6. Social Security and Income Tax</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are only working or touring temporarily in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you may be able to get a certificate or document from HMRC to continue paying National Insurance contributions in the UK. This means you’ll not have to pay social security contributions abroad.</p>

<p>You may need to pay UK Income Tax on any foreign income you earn from working or touring in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.</p>
