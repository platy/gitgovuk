<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Iceland.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-iceland">Sign up for email alerts</a></p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This information is about living in Iceland. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Iceland</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>State healthcare in Iceland is not completely free. Healthcare costs are covered by the state (through the Icelandic Health Insurance fund) and through patient contributions.</p>

<p>Patient contributions are capped each month. Once you’ve spent a certain amount, your state healthcare is free for the rest of the month.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Icelandic healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taking out private health insurance for the first 6 months of living in Iceland</li>
  <li>registering as a legal resident in Iceland then joining the state social insurance system</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with the Icelandic health insurance system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Iceland</h2>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-iceland#visas-and-residency" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> if you’re living in Iceland for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>You need <a href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/basic-requirements1" rel="external" class="govuk-link">private health insurance</a> when you move to Iceland for the first 6 months.</p>

<p>The Icelandic healthcare system is state funded. After you’ve been legally resident for 6 months, you automatically become a member of the Icelandic social insurance system.</p>

<p>You need to pay patient contributions directly towards the cost of your healthcare. The rest is paid for by the state through the <a href="https://www.sjukra.is/english" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Icelandic Health Insurance</a> fund.</p>

<p>There’s a limit to how much you pay for your healthcare in Iceland. The maximum amount you’ll pay depends on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your age</li>
  <li>whether you have a disability</li>
  <li>how often you need to get medicine</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’re a resident you may also be entitled to an <a href="https://www.sjukra.is/english/health-insurance-abroad/european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Icelandic European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a> for travel.</p>

<h3>If you started living in Iceland before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you started living in Iceland before 1 January 2021 and are registered with <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.skra.is/english/individuals/">Registers Iceland</a>, your rights to access healthcare in Iceland will stay the same for as long as you remain resident.</p>

<p>This means you may also be entitled to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an Icelandic <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to register for healthcare</h3>

<p>If you’re moving to Iceland from the UK, you’ll automatically become a member of the <a href="https://www.sjukra.is/english/social-insurance-in-iceland/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Icelandic social insurance system</a> after being legally resident in Iceland for 6 months.</p>

<p>You need to give your <a rel="external" href="https://www.skra.is/english/individuals/me-and-my-family/my-registration/id-numbers/" class="govuk-link">Kennitala ID</a> number each time you receive healthcare to prove that you’re covered.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>State healthcare in Iceland is not completely free. You may have to pay some of the cost when you receive treatment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sjukra.is/english/social-insurance-in-iceland/payment-participation-system" rel="external" class="govuk-link">See how much you’ll pay for health services each year in Iceland</a></p>

<p>Patient contributions are capped each month. The amount is lower if you’re a child, over 67 years old or disabled.
Once you’ve spent that amount, your healthcare will be free for the rest of that month.</p>

<p>The following healthcare services are free in Iceland:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visits to healthcare clinics if you’re over 67 years old or disabled</li>
  <li>inpatient hospital care and treatment</li>
  <li>maternity care</li>
  <li>all healthcare services for children with a GP referral</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.sjukra.is/english/social-insurance-in-iceland/dental-care/">Dental care</a> is not covered by Iceland Health Insurance for most people.</p>

<p>Children’s dental care is free if they register with a family dentist. There’s an annual check-up charge for this of 2,500 Icelandic krona per child.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Iceland temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) country.</p>

<h3>Healthcare for posted workers who started before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>You can access healthcare in Iceland using a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or an S1 form.</p>

<h3>Healthcare for posted workers moving to Iceland</h3>

<p>You may need to cover the cost of your healthcare with private health insurance.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Iceland</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>If you started living in Iceland before 1 January 2021, you may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-iceland" class="govuk-link">Icelandic resident</a> and receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Icelandic system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Iceland on the same basis as an Icelandic citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Switzerland</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Switzerland</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Iceland than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>

<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services  
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Iceland</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 form with <a href="https://www.sjukra.is/english/moving-to-iceland/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Icelandic Health Insurance</a>.</p>

<p>Complete the <a href="https://www.sjukra.is/english/social-insurance-in-iceland/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">application for Icelandic health insurance</a> form and send it with your S1 form to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Icelandic Health Insurance
<br>International department
<br>Vínlandsleið 16
<br>113 Reykjavik
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You can also email it to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:international@sjukra.is">international@sjukra.is</a></p>

<p>Once registered, you’ll be entitled to state healthcare on the same basis as an Icelandic citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Iceland</h2>

<p>You should either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take out private travel insurance with healthcare coverage</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-iceland">register as a resident</a> to get state health insurance after 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>Speak to your university for further advice.</p>

<h3>UK students in Iceland before 1 January 2021</h3>
<p>If you were in Iceland to study before 1 January 2021, and have not yet registered as a resident, you need to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/ehic">apply for a new UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> entitles you to medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period in Iceland.</p>

<p>Make sure you also have travel insurance to cover the duration of your course.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in Iceland before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
