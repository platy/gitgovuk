<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://udsc.gov.pl/en/cudzoziemcy/brexit/">Polish Office for Foreigners dedicated page on Brexit</a>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with a deal, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals arriving in Poland before 31 December 2020 will be able to stay and register under the current rules.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves without a deal, the Polish government has stated that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals legally residing in Poland at the point of Brexit will be able to stay and continue their lives as they do now.</p>

<p>In order to secure your status and these rights, you should register your stay or apply for permanent residency before Brexit. Incomplete applications will be discontinued if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal before your application is completed.  If you have not yet registered your stay in Poland, you should do so as soon as possible. Read the <a rel="external" href="https://udsc.gov.pl/en/cudzoziemcy/brexit/materials-to-download/">guidance issued by the Polish Office for Foreigners</a>.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, and you are already legally resident in Poland, you will need to submit a new residency application specifically for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals legally resident in Poland at the point of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>â€™s exit from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. You will have until 31 December 2020 to submit your application.</p>

<p>If you previously attempted to register your stay in Poland before Brexit but your application was discontinued, this will not prevent you from making an application under the new scheme. You may need to provide more documentation to prove that you were legally resident in Poland on the day of exit. For more information you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>read the <a rel="external" href="https://udsc.gov.pl/en/cudzoziemcy/brexit/">Polish Office for Foreigners page dedicated to Brexit</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-poland">sign up for our email updates</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Poland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations. If thereâ€™s no deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>, you will be able to stay up to 90 days in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must ensure you are properly registered for healthcare as a resident in Poland, as well as registering, where necessary, with a health insurer.</p>

<p>If you live in Poland and receive an exportable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Poland, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to access healthcare in Poland.</p>

<p>When you travel from Poland for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">foreign travel insurance</a>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If thereâ€™s a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Poland will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Poland.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, and you are a resident in Poland and pay contributions to the National Health Fund (NFZ), you will continue to have access to healthcare in Poland after Brexit.</p>

<p>If you are registered for healthcare in any other way, your access to healthcare may change and you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Poland for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If thereâ€™s no deal, and there is no arrangement with Poland to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>You must take action now to confirm your residency status and decide how to ensure access to healthcare.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid in the event if thereâ€™s no deal. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has offered to maintain the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> scheme should the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, however this is reliant on Poland continuing to accept <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> EHICs.</p>

<p>You should read the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-poland/">guidance on healthcare for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals in Poland and how it may change after <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>.</p>
