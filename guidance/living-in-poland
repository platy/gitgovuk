<p>If you are resident in Poland at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Poland.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passport.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Poland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a>  before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Poland, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to other Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and the Ireland will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-poland">Driving in Poland</h2>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licences are only valid in Poland for the first 6 months of residence. After 6 months, you must exchange your driving licence for a Polish licence. You do not need to retake a driving or theory test to exchange your licence.</p>

<p>You can still use your Polish licence in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for short visits or exchange it for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licence without taking a test if you return to live in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Poland, read the information on:</p>

You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so, you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are living in Poland or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, youâ€™ll have life-long healthcare rights in Poland as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<p>You must be registered for healthcare as a resident in Poland, and if necessary, with healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>Read the Polish Ministry of Health <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.pl/web/zdrowie/informacja-nt-konsekwencji-uporzadkowanego-brexitu" class="govuk-link">guidance about the transition period and your healthcare rights in Poland</a> (in Polish).</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Poland and receive an exportable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-poland#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Poland, you must not use your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to access healthcare in Poland.</p>

<p>When you travel from Poland for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, as you did before, during this time.</p>
