<h2>Book and plan your visit to Spring Hill</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit at least 3 working days in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-spring-hill">required ID</a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>Up to 2 adults can visit at a time, plus children. At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit.</p>

<p>There are limits to the number of visits a person can have. You can check this with the prisoner.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Spring Hill</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Spring Hill.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Spring Hill using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at Spring Hill.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Spring Hill</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Prisoners at Spring Hill are given a list of approved items that can be handed in during visits.</p>

<p>The items should be handed to staff to be opened and checked. Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Spring Hill</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>They will get to speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>
<p>Each person who arrives at Spring Hill gets an induction that lasts about a week. They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>

  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Around 300 men live at Spring Hill. Most men share a room.</p>

<p>Prisoners have access to a gym, weights room, sports field, library and chaplaincy.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>
<p>Learning opportunities are provided by Milton Keynes College. Qualifications are available in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>functional Skills, including IT</li>

<p>Courses are also available from Oxford Brookes University and the Open University.</p>

<p>Spring Hill is part of the Prisons ICT Academy (PICTA) which helps prepare prisoners for work in information and communications technology (ICT) roles.</p>

<p>Prisoners are encouraged to find employment. This ranges from training placements which allow men to earn qualifications while working, and full-time work. Springhill provides opportunities through companies that have an ongoing relationship with the prison, such as Chef Direct, Green King and DHL. Men can also find their own work.</p>

<p>Work placements are also available throughout the prison, for example in the kitchens, farms and gardens. Many of these come with the chance to earn qualifications at the same time.</p>

<p>The ‘working out’ scheme enables prisoners to also work in the community. These placements start on a voluntary basis and can progress to paid employment.</p>

<p>Spring Hill also offers programmes in personal development, social and life skills designed to help prisoners as they approach release.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>
<p>Prisoners can be assessed for temporary release. This time can be used for work experience and community work, as well as preparing for release. Prisoners can apply for this within the prison.</p>
