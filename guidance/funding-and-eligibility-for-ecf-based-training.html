<h2>
<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h2>

<p>We support schools with additional funding for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training. This is paid directly to schools and covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5% off timetable for early career teachers (<abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>) in year 2 of induction, for induction activities including <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training and mentor sessions</li>
  <li>a dedicated mentor for each <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>, based on 20 hours of mentoring in year 2 of induction</li>
</ul>

<p>If a school <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-schools-how-to-manage-ecf-based-training#option-1">uses a training provider</a>, we also fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li>training delivered to <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> by the lead provider or delivery partner, paid directly to lead providers</li>
  <li>training delivered to mentors by the lead provider or delivery partner, paid directly to lead providers</li>
  <li>36 hours of mentor time off timetable for training over 2 years, paid directly to schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Schools that are not eligible for funding can arrange an <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training programme directly with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-schools-how-to-manage-ecf-based-training#lead-providers">lead provider</a>, but will need to fund the programme themselves.</p>

<h3>Year 1 funding for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h3>

<p>Schools receive their core funding through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-authorities-pre-16-schools-funding#dedicated-schools-grant">dedicated schools grant (DSG)</a>. We calculate this using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-national-funding-formula/guide-to-national-funding-formula">national funding formula (NFF)</a>. This funding is primarily based on pupil numbers and characteristics and is allocated by the local authority.</p>

<p>Funding is not ‘earmarked’ for statutory induction. It’s up to headteachers to manage the funding they receive.</p>

<p>Headteachers should use core funding to cover the cost of 10% off timetable for <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> in year 1 of induction.</p>

<h3>Year 2 funding for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h3>
<p>We pay this funding directly to schools in the summer of year 2. It covers the cost of giving each <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5% off timetable in year 2 of induction</li>
  <li>20 hours of mentor support in year 2 of induction</li>
</ul>

<p>We calculate funding using the average hourly rate for mentors and early career teachers, split by region.</p>

<p>We collect data on <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and mentors through the school workforce census to minimise the administrative burden on schools.</p>

<h4>Backfill payments for mentor training</h4>

<p>Read the separate guidance document on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/backfill-payments-for-time-off-timetable-for-early-career-framework-ecf-mentor-training-national-roll-out/backfill-payments-for-time-off-timetable-for-early-career-framework-ecf-mentor-training-national-roll-out">backfill payments for time off timetable for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr> mentor training</a>.</p>

<h3>Proportionate funding</h3>
<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> makes proportionate funding payments for <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are on a reduced induction period</li>
  <li>are serving a part-time induction</li>
  <li>move to a new school or withdraw from induction during year 2</li>
  <li>take parental leave</li>
</ul>

<p>We will identify these <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> using school workforce census data collections over the period.</p>

<h2>Eligibility for funded <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based training</h2>

<h3>Eligible schools and establishments</h3>

<p>Schools and establishments eligible for <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state-funded schools, colleges, sixth forms, children’s centres and nurseries</li>
  <li>maintained and non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>independent schools that receive Section 41 funding</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eligible early career teachers (<abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> should be eligible for <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding if they both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold qualified teacher status (QTS)</li>
  <li>start their induction on or after 1 September 2021</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> with qualified teacher learning and skills status (QTLS) are not eligible for <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> funding, because they are exempt from statutory induction.</p>

<h3>How <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> checks the eligibility of <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and mentors</h3>

<p>If a school uses a training provider or accredited materials, we have to make sure that everyone taking part is eligible for funding and access to materials.</p>

<p>When school induction tutors <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">register <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and mentors with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr></a>, we check the teacher’s details in the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) records.</p>

<p>We check that the <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>holds qualified teacher status (QTS)</li>
  <li>has not completed statutory induction before</li>
  <li>has not started an induction before 1 September 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>We check that the mentor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>does not have any prohibitions, sanctions or restrictions on their record</li>
  <li>has not received funded training for <abbr title="early career framework">ECF</abbr>-based mentoring before</li>
</ul>

<p>The school induction tutor can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">sign into <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s service</a> to see the status of these eligibility checks.</p>
