    <p>To edit your organisation page, select the ‘Details’ tab, scroll down and click the ‘Edit’ button.</p>
<h3>Add a default image for news articles</h3>
<p>You need to include a default image for your organisation that will appear if an editor publishes a news story without an image.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Under ‘Select an image to be shown by default on news articles’ click on the ‘Choose file’ button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select a jpeg, gif or png file of a generic photo that reflects your organisation, at 960 pixels wide and 640 pixels high, minimum 75 dpi.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Email address</h3>
<p>You need to include an email address so the public can order attachments in alternative formats.</p>
<h3>Status on GOV.UK</h3>
<p>There are several options for setting your organisation’s status including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‘Currently live’</li>
  <li>‘Coming soon’</li>
  <li>‘Exempt from joining’</li>
  <li>‘Currently transitioning’</li>
  <li>‘Closed’</li>
</ul>
<p>When your organisation goes live on GOV.UK, change the status to ‘Currently live’. Once your organisation is live do not change the status or your organisation will disappear from GOV.UK.</p>
<h3>Associations</h3>
<p>Under ‘Associations’ you need to select your ‘Sponsoring organisation/s’.</p>
<p>Once your basic organisation page is set up you have the option to include ‘Featured links’.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-accordion__section-heading"><span class="govuk-accordion__section-button">Choosing your homepage layout</span></h2>
          
</div>        <div class="govuk-accordion__section-content">
<div class="gem-c-govspeak govuk-govspeak " data-module="govspeak">
    <p>If you have ‘managing editor’ permissions you can choose from 2 layout options for your homepage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‘news priority’ (formerly ‘top tasks’)</li>
  <li>‘service priority’ (formerly ‘featured services and guidance’)</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to choose the right layout for your organisation page</h3>
<p>You should choose the layout that best meets the needs of your users. 
You can use Google Analytics to find out what people come to your homepage to do. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a high percentage of searches from your organisation page indicates the current format isn’t meeting needs - check what terms users are searching for</li>
  <li>if your page is news-based but a high proportion of users are clicking on featured links, you might consider whether a service-based page would work better for your users</li>
  <li>if your page is service-based and there’s evidence of high numbers of users clicking further down the page, a news-based page might meet your users’ needs better</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have much new content to feature in the feature boxes, this could be because your organisation has an emphasis on services.</p>
<h3>How to change the layout of your organisation page</h3>
<p>To change the layout of your organisation page, select the ‘Details’ tab, scroll down and click the ‘Edit’ button.</p>
<p>Under ‘Position of featured links on organisation homepage’, select the radio button above the image which shows the layout you want to use. Under ‘Featured links’ complete or edit the ‘Title’ and ‘Url’ fields. To add more featured links, click on ‘Add another’.</p>
<p>The ‘news priority’ layout can have up to 5 featured links. The ‘service priority’ layout can have up to 10 featured links.</p>
<p>Only managing editors can add or edit featured links.</p>
<h3>‘News priority’ homepage layout</h3>
<p>‘News priority’ featured links are the main things users come to your organisation to do that are not covered by existing content on your pages.</p>
<h4>Select featured links based on evidence of use</h4>
<p>‘News priority’ featured links must be used sparingly and only kept if you have evidence from Google Analytics that users are using them.</p>
<p>As a guide, each ‘news priority’ featured link should be followed by at least 2% of total visitors to your organisation page (measured in total unique pageviews).</p>
<p>‘News priority’ featured links should point to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GOV.UK ‘Services and information’ (or ‘mainstream’) content</li>
  <li>information or tools on other domains</li>
  <li>publications that are heavily used</li>
</ul>
<p>The text of the link must be as specific and active as possible, and not overlap with titles used for ‘corporate’ content types.</p>
<p>You can create links to information that’s not on GOV.UK if there’s evidence of user demand, for example the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence">Ministry of Defence</a> links to the <a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/" rel="external">army</a>, <a href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" rel="external">navy</a> and <a href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" rel="external">Royal Air Force</a> sites.</p>
<h4>What should not go in the ‘news priority’ featured links area</h4>
<p>Do not put anything in the top tasks list that’s already covered by a link on your organisation’s homepage. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>detailed guidance</li>
  <li>high profile groups</li>
  <li>contact information (for press offices or other bodies)</li>
  <li>lists of ministers</li>
  <li>links to all press releases or announcements</li>
  <li>links to all statistics and research</li>
  <li>blogs and social media (these can be personalised under ‘follow us’, or calls to action added to relevant policies or publication pages)</li>
  <li>working for us</li>
  <li>procurement</li>
  <li>our priorities</li>
</ul>
<p>Only use ‘news priority’ featured links to promote microsites or campaign sites when there is clear evidence of demand.</p>
<p>The Government Digital Service (<abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr>) may remove any links that do not meet the standard. If you’re not sure what these links should be, ask <abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr> for content advice via the <a href="https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk/" rel="external">GOV.UK Support</a> form.</p>
<h3>‘Service priority’ homepage layout</h3>
<p>The ‘service priority’ layout is for organisations that have very little (if any) news, publishing or policy activity, but a high volume of users with very specific, service-oriented needs.</p>
<p>You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-the-government-digital-service/request-a-thing">ask <abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr> to be able to use featured services and guidance</a> proposing the text and URLs for up to 10 links.</p>
<h4>Choosing the links</h4>
<p>When choosing links, consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what users are searching for from your organisation page</li>
  <li>routing users to specialist browse pages (if you have them)</li>
  <li>the top tasks from your existing organisation page</li>
  <li>most popular content based on page views</li>
  <li>user feedback comments</li>
  <li>frequent contact centre queries</li>
  <li>balancing mainstream and specialist user needs</li>
  <li>seasonal trends (for example applications for study visas or fishing rod licences)</li>
</ul>
<p><abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr> content designers can help you with choosing the links and the wording based on users’ needs.</p>

    <p>Organisations should never be deleted from GOV.UK. Instead, the status of an organisation can be changed to ‘closed’.</p>
<p>Organisations marked as closed are not listed on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations">organisations index</a> and disappear from the parent or sponsor department’s organisation page. But they continue to have a profile page findable at the same URL, with a statement indicating they’re closed.</p>
<p>Closed organisation profiles will remain findable by external search engines and the internal site search, and remain listed as a filter option, for example when filtering by organisation on the list of all government publications.</p>
<h3>Documents tagged to the organisation</h3>
<p>All documents tagged to the organisation will stay tagged after it closes, so the context of who published it is retained.</p>
<p>You might need to re-tag some documents so they’re <a href="/government/publications/memorandum-of-understanding-between-department-for-business-innovation-and-skills-and-united-kingdom-accreditation-service--4">tagged to both the closing and new organisation</a>, for example if the closing organisation is being replaced, merging or changing its name.</p>
<p>Only re-tag a document to the new organisation if the content is still current - for example, guidance or policy should still be followed. Keep the document tagged to the closing organisation too.</p>
<p>To get an idea of what you need to re-tag, you can export a list of your organisation’s published documents and what content type they are. In the ‘Documents’ section of Whitehall Publisher, filter by your organisation name and select ‘Export as CSV’.</p>
<p><abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr> recommend re-tagging these document formats to the new organisation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>detailed guides</li>
  <li>‘guidance’ publications</li>
  <li>forms</li>
  <li>manuals</li>
  <li>research and analysis</li>
  <li>fatality notices</li>
  <li>independent reports</li>
  <li>correspondence - unless directly associated with a previous minister</li>
  <li>maps</li>
  <li>decisions</li>
  <li>case studies</li>
  <li>international treaties</li>
</ul>
<p>You should only re-tag the following formats to the new organisation if the content will be updated by the new organisation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>national statistics</li>
  <li>statistical releases</li>
  <li>transparency data</li>
  <li>open consultations</li>
</ul>
<p>These formats should not be re-tagged to the new organisation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>news articles</li>
  <li>press releases</li>
  <li>annual reports</li>
  <li>transparency data</li>
  <li>statistics</li>
  <li>closed consultations</li>
  <li>documents in history mode</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be exceptions to the list of formats that should not be re-tagged - for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>things that are heavily used, like recent news articles</li>
  <li>an announcement of something that has not yet happened</li>
  <li>history mode published in the wrong format</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Ask <abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr></a> if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you do not know what to re-tag to the new organisation</li>
  <li>there are too many documents to re-tag manually - <abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr> can bulk re-tag</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to close an organisation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the ‘More’ tab and then ‘Departments and agencies’. Select your organisation name from the list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change its ‘Status on GOV.UK’ from ‘Currently live’ to ‘Closed’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the ‘Reason for closure’ menu that appears, choose one of these:</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>no longer exists</li>
  <li>replaced</li>
  <li>split into parts</li>
  <li>merged with another organisation</li>
  <li>change of name</li>
  <li>no longer part of central government</li>
  <li>devolved to regional government</li>
</ul>
<p>If your organisation is being taken over by another organisation, enter the name of the organisation taking over from (superseding) your organisation.</p>
<p>Choose the date the organisation closed.</p>
<h3>What a closed organisation page will look like</h3>
<p>There are different options in Whitehall publisher for describing ‘closed’ organisations, each of which generates slightly different wording for users.</p>
