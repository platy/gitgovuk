<h2 id="the-uk-swiss-citizens-rights-agreement">The UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement</h2>

<p>The UK has reached an agreement with Switzerland, which protects the rights of UK nationals in Switzerland, whether or not the UK reaches a deal with the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, the agreement will protect UK nationals resident in Switzerland from the end of the implementation period. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the agreement will apply from the day the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>The agreement protects UK nationals’ right to stay and to work, including frontier workers, family reunification and access to healthcare. It also protects social security benefits, access to an uprated state pension and export benefits, and the continued recognition of professional qualifications.</p>

<p>For more information read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-agreements-with-the-eea-efta-states-and-switzerland">UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement</a> and our <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/767005/Explainer_-_Swiss_citizens__rights_agreement.pdf">Explainer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/switzerland/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Switzerland</a>.</p>

<p>If you move to Switzerland, you must register at your local office of resident services (Einwohnerdienste or Centre du contrôle des habitants) within 14 days of arriving. Read the guidance by the Swiss government on <a rel="external" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/notification-departure-registration">notification of departure and registration</a>.</p>

<p>If you stay and are employed for more than three months, you will need to apply for a residence permit with your local cantonal authority (Einwohnerdienste or Centre du contrôle des habitants).</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>
<p>The UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement will protect UK nationals resident in Switzerland after Brexit. If you are in scope of the Agreement, you will not need to take any special action to benefit from it.</p>

<p>You should reapply for a new permit before your existing one expires, as usual. This applies whether you hold a short or long stay permit, or a frontier worker permit.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, current travel rules between the UK and Switzerland will apply until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, UK nationals would not need a visa to enter Switzerland for short stays of up to 90 days in a 180 day period.</p>

<p>The UK and Switzerland have reached a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-swiss-transitional-migration-arrangements-for-a-no-deal-scenario">transitional migration agreement</a>, which will apply if there’s no deal. The agreement would allow UK workers to access the Swiss labour market and Swiss workers to access the UK labour market until December 2020. If there’s no deal, UK workers would be able to move to Switzerland in similar numbers as now until the end of 2020. The Swiss government has already confirmed that 3,500 work permits will be made available to UK nationals in 2019. The <a rel="external" href="https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/aktuell/news/2019/ref_2019-02-130.html">Swiss government announcement</a> has more information on this.</p>

<p>There will be no restrictions for those coming to Switzerland to work for less than 4 months.</p>

<h2 id="international-permits-cartes-de-lgitimation">International permits (cartes de légitimation)</h2>
<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/missions/mission-onu-geneve/en/home/manual-regime-privileges-and-immunities/introduction/legitimation-card.html">International permits (cartes de légitimation)</a> will not be affected by Brexit. Special provisions will continue to apply to international permit holders wishing to retire and remain in Switzerland.</p>

<p>UK nationals with an international permit are not in the scope of the UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Switzerland</a>.</p>

<p>You can look at our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/switzerland">travel advice for Switzerland</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. During this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU, including Switzerland</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You must retain evidence of travel (for example, train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>
<p>You must take out compulsory insurance with a Swiss health insurance company no later than 3 months after arriving or beginning to work in Switzerland. You can look at the Swiss government’s website for information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/health-insurance-foreigners/">health insurance for foreigners in Switzerland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/social-insurance-foreign-nationals/">social insurance for foreign nationals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are living or working in Switzerland, you need to have <a rel="external" href="https://www.ahv-iv.ch/en/Social-insurances/Old-age-and-survivors-insurance-OASI">old-age and survivors’ insurance</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.ahv-iv.ch/en/Social-insurances/Disability-insurance-DI">disability insurance</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Switzerland and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Switzerland, you must not use a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Switzerland.</p>

<p>When you travel from Switzerland for a temporary stay in a European Economic Area (EEA) country, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, there will be no changes to your access to healthcare until the end of the implementation period. After the implementation period, the UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement will protect the rights of UK nationals who are resident in Switzerland at that time.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, the UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement protects the rights of those UK nationals resident in Switzerland on the day that the UK leaves the EU. Your access to healthcare will not change for UK nationals resident in Switzerland, including students and S1 holders.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid if there’s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme if there’s no deal, however this is reliant on Switzerland continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-switzerland">Working in Switzerland</h2>

<h3 id="working-in-switzerland-after-brexit">Working in Switzerland after Brexit</h3>
