<h2 id="the-uk-swiss-citizens-rights-agreement">The UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement</h2>

<p>The UK has reached an agreement with Switzerland, which protects the rights of UK nationals in Switzerland, whether or not the UK reaches a deal with the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, the agreement will protect UK nationals resident in Switzerland from the end of the implementation period. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the agreement will apply from the day the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>The agreement protects UK nationals’ right to stay and to work, including frontier workers, family reunification and access to healthcare. It also protects social security benefits, access to an uprated state pension and export benefits, and the continued recognition of professional qualifications.</p>

<p>For more information, you can read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-agreements-with-the-eea-efta-states-and-switzerland">UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement</a> and our <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/767005/Explainer_-_Swiss_citizens__rights_agreement.pdf">Explainer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/switzerland/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Switzerland</a>.</p>

<p>If you come to live in Switzerland, you must register at your local office of resident services (Einwohnerdienste or Centre du contrôle des habitants) within 14 days of arriving. For more information, see the information by the Swiss government on <a rel="external" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/notification-departure-registration">notification of departure and registration</a>.</p>

<p>If you stay and are employed for more than 3 months, you will need to apply for a residence permit with your local cantonal authority (Einwohnerdienste or Centre du contrôle des habitants).</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a> for further information.</p>

<h3 id="residency-and-visas-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency and visas after the UK leaves the EU</h3>
<p>The UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement will protect UK nationals resident in Switzerland after the UK leaves the EU.  If you are in scope of the Agreement, you will not need to take any special action to benefit from it.</p>

<p>You should reapply for a new permit before your existing one expires, as usual. This applies whether you hold a short or long stay permit, or a frontier worker permit.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, current travel rules between the UK and Switzerland will apply until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, UK nationals would not need a visa to enter Switzerland for short stays of up to 90 days in a 180 day period. Swiss and UK officials are in discussions on the details of a transitional migration agreement which would apply in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. We will update this guide when there is more information on this.</p>

<p>UK nationals who wish to move to Switzerland after the UK leaves the EU to work for more than 4 months would be subject to Switzerland’s non-EU migration system. The Swiss government has confirmed that 3,500 work permits would be made available to UK nationals until the end of 2019. The <a rel="external" href="https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/aktuell/news/2019/ref_2019-02-130.html">Swiss government announcement</a> has more information on this.</p>

<p>There will be no restrictions for those coming to Switzerland to work for less than 4 months.</p>

<h2 id="international-permits-cartes-de-lgitimation">International permits (cartes de légitimation)</h2>
<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/missions/mission-onu-geneve/en/home/manual-regime-privileges-and-immunities/introduction/legitimation-card.html">International permits (cartes de légitimation)</a> will not be affected by the UK leaving the EU. Special provisions will continue to apply to international permit holders wishing to retire and remain in Switzerland.</p>

<p>UK nationals with an international permit are not in scope of the UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Switzerland</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document</a> or ‘emergency passport’.</p>

<p>You can look at our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/switzerland">travel advice for Switzerland</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the Schengen area, including Switzerland</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in Switzerland and EU countries, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU Member State or Switzerland, you will be able to transit through the Schengen area to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>
<p>You must take out compulsory insurance with a Swiss health insurance company no later than three months after arriving or beginning to work in Switzerland. You can look at the Swiss government’s website for more information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/health-insurance-foreigners/">health insurance for foreigners in Switzerland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/social-insurance-foreign-nationals/">social insurance for foreign nationals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are living or working in Switzerland, you need to have <a rel="external" href="https://www.ahv-iv.ch/en/Social-insurances/Old-age-and-survivors-insurance-OASI">old-age and survivors’ insurance</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.ahv-iv.ch/en/Social-insurances/Disability-insurance-DI">disability insurance</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Switzerland and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Switzerland, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Switzerland.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2">check if your prescriptions are legal</a> in Switzerland.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, there will be no changes to your access to healthcare until the end of the implementation period. After the implementation period, the UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement will protect the rights of UK nationals who are resident in Switzerland at that time.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement protects the rights of those UK nationals resident in Switzerland on the day that the UK leaves the EU. Your access to healthcare will not change for UK nationals resident in Switzerland, including students and S1 holders.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme after the UK leaves the EU, however this is reliant on Switzerland continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>You should read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-switzerland/">NHS guidance on healthcare for UK nationals in Switzerland and how it may change after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-switzerland">Working in Switzerland</h2>

<p>You should read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>. You will need to register your residence for work purposes in Switzerland.</p>

<p>If you live abroad and require a police certificate from the UK, apply to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">ACRO Criminal Record Office</a>.</p>

<p>If you work 8 hours or more a week, you’re covered against <a rel="external" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/accident-insurance-who-covered/">occupational and non-occupational accidents</a> by your employer.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-switzerland-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Switzerland after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/switzerland-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Switzerland to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a></li>
</ul>

<p>See the Swiss government’s detailed <a rel="external" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/paying-taxes/">information on paying tax</a>.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Switzerland. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/switzerland-list-of-lawyers">Find an English speaking lawyer in Switzerland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">to pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in Switzerland.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Switzerland. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Switzerland, you can claim:</p>
