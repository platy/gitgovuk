<p>If you bring goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain or a country outside of the EU, you may be liable to pay EU customs duty.</p>

<p>If you intend to bring goods into Northern Ireland which you know are not ‘at risk’ of moving to the EU, then you can apply for authorisation under the UK Trader Scheme.</p>

<p>If your goods are not ‘at risk’ then you will either pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>zero duty if moving goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain</li>
  <li>UK duty if moving goods from a country outside the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not have experience in customs or would like to find out more information, you can register with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trader-support-service">Trader Support Service</a> to support you with this process.</p>

<h2>Who can apply</h2>

<p>To apply you must be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>established in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>established elsewhere in the UK and:
    <ul>
      <li>your customs operations are carried out in the UK</li>
      <li>you have a fixed place of business in Northern Ireland, for example, a branch or a store where goods are sold to, or provided for final use by, end-consumers</li>
      <li>you have an indirect customs representative in Northern Ireland - such as the Trader Support Service</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a good customs and tax compliance record</li>
  <li>have no record of serious criminal offences related to your economic activity</li>
  <li>have records, systems and controls in place that allow you to declare and evidence that goods are not ‘at risk’, for example, that the goods are sold to customers in Northern Ireland - these must be accessible at your business premises in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>be able to provide evidence on request from HMRC to confirm that your goods were correctly declared as not ‘at risk’</li>
</ul>

<p>If you move goods into Northern Ireland to be processed, you’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="#goods-for-processing">meet additional conditions</a> to declare these goods not ‘at risk’.</p>

<p>Your compliance record will be based on the last 3 years prior to application. During that period, you must not have committed a serious infringement or repeated infringements of customs rules. If you have been established for less than 3 years, then your compliance will be judged on the records and information available, including your involvement in previous businesses.</p>

<h2>When to apply</h2>

<p>You must apply for authorisation under the UK Trader Scheme if you want to declare your goods not ‘at risk’.</p>

<p>If you applied before the end of February 2021 you will have received a provisional authorisation for up to 4 months whilst we processed your application. While provisionally authorised you may declare goods as not ‘at risk’.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" role="note" aria-label="Warning">
<p>If you have a known history of serious non-compliance or criminal offences relating to your economic activity, then you’ll not be eligible for a provisional authorisation.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you apply after February 2021</h3>

<p>Applications can take up to a month to be processed by HMRC, so you must ensure you apply one month before you plan to move goods that you want to declare goods not ‘at risk’.</p>

<h3>If you supply goods to a business in Northern Ireland but do not have a fixed address in Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>You can be authorised to declare goods not ‘at risk’ without having your own fixed address in Northern Ireland. This has been extended until 1 November 2021 if all of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you do not have a fixed address in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>you supply goods to a business in Northern Ireland which has a fixed place of business from where those goods are provided for, or sold to end consumers, and that business is either:
    <ul>
      <li>authorised under the UK Trader Scheme</li>
      <li>could be authorised, were they the importer of those goods</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To be authorised to declare goods not ‘at risk’ in these circumstances, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet all of the other UK Trader Scheme criteria</li>
  <li>be able to declare not ‘at risk’ for end-use or sale to end consumers in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>In your application you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>list the addresses of the businesses in Northern Ireland that you supply and who are authorised or meet the criteria to be authorised - you will be able to list these as part of the application form</li>
  <li>tell HMRC that you are supplying goods to a business in Northern Ireland who is authorised or meets the criteria to be authorised, but you do not currently have a fixed premises in Northern Ireland - you should state this in your covering email when submitting your application for authorisation</li>
</ul>

<p>In the period up to 1 November 2021, you should take steps to restructure or amend your contractual terms to meet the full requirements for UK Trader Scheme authorisation.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you do not meet the full establishment criteria for the UK Trader Scheme by 1 November 2021 your authorisation may be revoked.</p>
</div>

<h2>What you’ll need</h2>

<p>To apply for authorisation, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of any other customs authorisations you hold, such as AEO, CFSP or customs special procedures -  this means you’ll not need to provide as much information when you apply</li>
  <li>your XI EORI number</li>
  <li>details of your business and its directors</li>
  <li>your company registration number or Unique Taxpayer Reference if you are a sole trader or partnership</li>
  <li>your VAT registration number if you have one</li>
  <li>the estimated number of declarations you’ll make annually</li>
  <li>details of your business premises in Northern Ireland such as where you undertake processing or sell goods to consumers - you must provide details of all the premises you have in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you move goods for processing</h3>

<p>If the goods you move into Northern Ireland will be processed there, you’ll also need to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide your turnover for the most recent financial year, stating that this is below £500,000</li>
  <li>declare that you intend to bring goods for processing into Northern Ireland  for one or more of the following sole purposes:
    <ul>
      <li>food for sale to end consumers in the UK</li>
      <li>construction, where the processed goods form a permanent part of a structure that is constructed and located in Northern Ireland by the importer</li>
      <li>direct provision to the recipient of health or care services by the importer in Northern Ireland</li>
      <li>not for profit activities in Northern Ireland, where there is no subsequent sale of the processed good by the importer</li>
      <li>the final use of animal feed on premises located in Northern Ireland by the importer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Records, systems and controls</h3>

<p>You’ll need to give details of the records, systems and controls you have in place that allow you to accurately declare that goods are not ‘at risk’.</p>

<p>The records you tell us about will be specific and appropriate to your business and they’ll need to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where you source goods from</li>
  <li>how and where they’ll be used or sold in the UK as a whole or Northern Ireland only where appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a small or medium sized business you do not need complex systems, but they must be appropriate to the size, nature and complexity of the business.</p>

<p>For example, if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a large business - you may tell us about the logistical software that you have, which tracks goods from import to end use</li>
  <li>a small or medium-sized business - you may instead tell us about the internal processes or procedures you have in place which allow you to document the goods you import and evidence they are not ‘at risk’, like purchase and sales records</li>
</ul>

<p>At authorisation, you should give details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>systems and processes to track goods from import to end-use - such as logistics systems or stock control processes</li>
  <li>documented procedures and administrative systems to determine whether goods are not ‘at risk’</li>
  <li>internal controls and processes that ensure goods were correctly declared not ‘at risk’</li>
  <li>commercial or transport records - such as delivery records or inventory systems which confirm end use of the goods</li>
</ul>

<ol class="steps">

<h2>After you’ve applied</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You’ll get a notification from us to confirm we have your application for authorisation.</p>

<p>You’ll get a further notification once your application has been approved for full authorisation. If your application is approved, we will send you a letter with your UK Trader Scheme authorisation number.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>If we reject your application, we’ll send you a letter. You’ll no longer be able to declare your goods not ‘at risk’. You can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask us to review its decision – the address to write to will be on your letter</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-tribunal" class="govuk-link">appeal to the tax tribunal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You must keep evidence that your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-declare-goods-you-bring-into-northern-ireland-not-at-risk-of-moving-to-the-eu-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">goods are not ‘at risk’</a> (for example, sales receipts) for 5 years.  The types of records you must keep will be specific to your business but must clearly demonstrate the end use of the goods.</p>

<p>We may visit you to check your records. You must be able to provide access to a customs officer to check the records, systems and controls you have told us about, and evidence to confirm each declaration.</p>
