<h3>What happens after you apply</h3>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will confirm that you’re conditionally accepted as a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition authorised audit provider. Then <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will publish your details on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-authorised-audit-providers">list of authorised audit providers on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Before you’re fully accepted as a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition authorised audit provider, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will do a quality check of your first audit.</p>

<p>If you meet all the standards at the quality check then <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will confirm that you’re fully accepted as a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition authorised audit provider.</p>

<h4>Quality check of your first audit</h4>
<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will do a quality check of the first <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition audit that the senior auditor at your organisation carries out. This is to make sure that audit standards are set at the right level and are consistent across all audit providers.</p>

<p>When an operator contacts you for your first audit, you need to email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dvsaer@dvsa.gov.uk">dvsaer@dvsa.gov.uk</a> with the date, time and address of the audit. One of the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition team will go to the audit to check that you meet the auditor standards.</p>

<p>If your audit doesn’t meet the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition standards, the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition team will decide if the operator you’re auditing has passed. Then <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will give you feedback and work with you to help you meet the standards.</p>

<h2>Working as a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition authorised audit provider</h2>

<p>You should always follow the <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1084624/dvsa-earned-recognition-authorised-audit-provider-code-of-practice.odt"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition authorised audit provider code of practice</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="OpenDocument Text document">ODT</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">768 KB</span>)</span> and <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1084626/dvsa-earned-recognition-authorised-audit-provider-terms-and-conditions.odt"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition terms and conditions for authorised audit providers</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="OpenDocument Text document">ODT</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">769 KB</span>)</span>.</p>

<p>You need to do at least 70 hours of continuing professional development every 5 years, including a 2-day Transport Manager Certificate of Professional Competence refresher course. A professional body, trade organisation or authorised training centre must run the refresher course.</p>

<p>You’re responsible for the cost of refresher courses and business expenses such as indemnity insurance.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will send you the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dvsa-earned-recognition-use-the-logo"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition logo</a> so that you can use this on your website and marketing materials.</p>

<p>Operators will contact you to book an audit. You’ll need a process to prevent any conflicts of interest between you and the operator you’re auditing.</p>

<h3>What you need to do when you carry out an audit</h3>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a systematic process</li>
  <li>carry out audits in a fair and unbiased way</li>
  <li>use the right number of samples for vehicle, trailer or driver records based on the size of the operator</li>
</ul>

<p>What you check during your audit is based on the size of the operator. You can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-vehicle-operator-standards/heavy-goods-vehicle-hgv-operator-audit-standards-dvsa-earned-recognition#earned-recognition-audit-sampling-criteria"><abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> sampling criteria</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-vehicle-operator-standards/public-service-vehicle-psv-operator-standards-dvsa-earned-recognition#earned-recognition-audit-sampling-criteria"><abbr title="public service vehicle">PSV</abbr> sampling criteria</a> to work out what you must check.</p>

<p>Any decisions or observations you make about the operator meeting the standards must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fully justified</li>
  <li>explained clearly</li>
  <li>documented in your audit report</li>
</ul>

<p>During the audit, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask open and probing questions</li>
  <li>observe and record positive and negative reactions to your questions</li>
  <li>check the operator’s policy and process documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>You must give objective evidence, show independence and write an impartial audit report.</p>

<p>Within 10 days of carrying out an audit, you need to send your audit report and any evidence to us. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will review this and decide if the operator can join <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition or stay on the scheme.</p>

<h3>Audits for operators who want to join the scheme</h3>

<p>You can audit an operator before or after they apply for <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition. You must send the results of the audit to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> up to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 months before the operator applies for <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition</li>
  <li>3 months after <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> receives the operator’s application</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will let you know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if there are any conditions on an operator’s licence you need to be aware of</li>
  <li>if you should check a particular operating centre as part of your audit</li>
  <li>if there is specific documentation you need to check</li>
</ul>

<p>You must make sure the operator’s systems meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvsa-earned-recognition-vehicle-operator-standards"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition audit standards</a>.</p>

<p>If an operator does not meet the standards and you think they can make improvements to meet these standards within the application period, you can help them make an improvement plan. You’ll need to check to make sure they have fixed the issues within the application period and then you can mark the audit as complete.</p>

<h3>Audits for existing <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition operators</h3>

<p>Operators need to have an audit every two years to make sure they still meet <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition standards.</p>

<p>If the operator fails the audit on minor issues that they can fix within 3 months, they can stay on the scheme.</p>

<p>If the operator fails significantly, you must send them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>feedback</li>
  <li>an action plan</li>
  <li>a time schedule to meet the standards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Regular quality checks</h3>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check your audit reports regularly</li>
  <li>carry out on-site quality checks if there are any issues with your audit reports</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens if you do not meet the standards</h2>

<p>If you do not follow the standards, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will remove you from the list of <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition authorised audit providers. You will not be able to carry out audits for <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition.</p>

<p>To meet the standards, you and your auditors must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the terms and conditions</li>
  <li>follow the code of practice</li>
  <li>make sure that operators are meeting <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition audit standards</li>
  <li>keep your competence qualification up to date</li>
  <li>keep your quality management systems accreditation up to date</li>
  <li>not be involved with or linked to anything likely to damage the reputation of the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> earned recognition scheme</li>
</ul>

<h3>Appeal being removed from the scheme</h3>

<p>If you don’t meet the standards, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will write to you explaining why.</p>

<p>You’ll have 14 days to appeal in writing with any facts or circumstances you want <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> to take into account.</p>

              <p class="app-c-published-dates__change-note">Removed section "What to include in your audit standards" as auditors can no longer use their own standards.

Terms and conditions:
* auditors now have to use an auditor workbook supplied by DVSA earned recognition instead of their own audit standards
* DVSA may carry out onsite auditor validation

Code of practice:
* auditors can no longer use their own additional standards to carry out DVSA earned recognition audits</p>

              <p class="app-c-published-dates__change-note">Updated terms and conditions - authorised audit providers must now have a recognised quality management system in place to ISO 9001:2015 standard, instead of to equal or similar standard.</p>

- how to appeal</p>
