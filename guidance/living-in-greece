<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/greece/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Greece</a>.</p>

<p>You must register as a resident in Greece if you want to stay for more than 3 months. Read <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/578218/Registration_certificate_-_Permanent_Residence_Certificate_requirements_updated_161212.pdf">registration certificate (Veveosi Engrafis) â€“ permanent residence requirements</a>.</p>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>Read <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.gov.gr/">the Greek governmentâ€™s website</a> (in Greek) about the UK leaving the EU, for citizens and businesses. Check the rights of UK nationals living in and traveling to Greece after the UK leaves the EU and submit any questions in the <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.gov.gr/contact/">contact form</a> provided.</p>

<p>After Brexit, you may need to change your registration document for a new resident card. If you are already registered as a resident in Greece, or you register before 31 December 2020, your residence documents will be considered as temporary national residence permits.</p>

<p>All residence documents will expire on 31 December 2020 and will be replaced by biometric residence permits. Residence document holders will be invited to exchange their document for a new biometric permit by the Ministry for Migration Policy at the end of 2020. <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.gov.gr/uk-citizens-in-greece/">Read the Greek governmentâ€™s Brexit website for more information.</a></p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Greece</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You must retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets) in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of the implementation period. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after the implementation period will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register for healthcare as a resident in Greece, as well as registering, where necessary, with a health insurer.</p>

<p>Read the NHS guidance on who is able to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-greece-including-greek-islands/">access healthcare in Greece and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Greece, you must not use a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) from the UK to access healthcare in Greece.</p>

<p>When you travel from Greece for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you live in Greece and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are a student, read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-facilities">find an English-speaking doctor</a> in Greece.</p>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Greece.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Greece will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Greece.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident you must review the status of your healthcare cover. You must take action now to confirm your residency status and decide how you will ensure access to healthcare.</p>

<p>If you currently have your healthcare costs paid for by the UK government, we can help if you are asked to pay for treatment during the first 6 months after Brexit. To organise a payment, you must give your healthcare providerâ€™s details to the NHS Business Services Authorityâ€™s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>You should read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-greece-including-greek-islands/">healthcare in Greece</a> and how it may change after Brexit.</p>

<p>The UK has offered to continue paying the country you live in for your healthcare in the event of no deal, just as it does now. The government has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Greece for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If thereâ€™s no deal, and there is no arrangement with Greece to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if thereâ€™s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> scheme if thereâ€™s no deal, however this is reliant on Greece continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-greece">Working in Greece</h2>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for:</p>

<h3 id="working-in-greece-after-brexit">Working in Greece after Brexit</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/greece-providing-services-after-eu-exit">Read guidance on providing services after Brexit</a> if youâ€™re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after Brexit.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, Greek legislation states that if you are already resident in Greece or arrive before 31 December 2020, you will still have access to the labour market, as long as you have a valid registration certificate.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Greece to prevent income being taxed in both countries.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

</ul>

<p>You must register for a tax identification number (AFM â€“ pronounced aa-fee-mee) â€“ read further guidance in the Greek government <a rel="external" href="http://www.ermis.gov.gr/portal/page/portal/ermis/FullStory?sid=240">ERMIS website</a> (in Greek), with central information and e-services. Once you have an AFM number, it is compulsory to submit a yearly tax return.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Greece. Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greece-list-of-lawyers">an English-speaking lawyer in Greece</a>.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<p>If the end date on your form is after 31 October 2019, you should contact theâ€¯relevant EU, EEA or Swiss authorityâ€¯to confirm whether you need to start paying social security contributions in that country after 31 October, as well as UK National Insurance contributions.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-brexit">Money and tax after Brexit</h3>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the EU.
