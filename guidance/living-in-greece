<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/greece/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Greece</a>.</p>

<p>You must register as a resident in Greece if you want to stay for more than 3 months. See <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/578218/Registration_certificate_-_Permanent_Residence_Certificate_requirements_updated_161212.pdf">registration certificate (Veveosi Engrafis) – permanent residence requirements</a>.</p>

<p>Read <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.gov.gr/">the Greek government’s website</a> (in Greek) about the UK leaving the EU, for citizens and businesses. Check the rights of UK nationals living in and traveling to Greece after the UK leaves the EU and submit any questions in the <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.gov.gr/contact/">contact form</a> provided.</p>

<p>If you want to live in Greece after the UK leaves the EU, you must make sure that you are correctly registered as a resident in Greece.</p>

<p>After the UK leaves the EU, you may need to change your registration document for a new resident card. We will update this guidance when we know how and when this will happen.</p>

<p>For more information, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-greece">sign up for email alerts</a> to this guidance on living in Greece</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Greece</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document</a> or ‘emergency passport’.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be new travel rules.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission has said you <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6402_en.htm">may not need visas for short stays</a> elsewhere in the Schengen area or the EU. You may be able to stay for up to 90 days in any EU country, within a 180 day period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You should ensure you are properly registered for healthcare as a resident in Greece, as well as registering, where necessary, with a health insurer. You can read the NHS guidance on who is able to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-greece-including-greek-islands/">access healthcare in Greece and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Greece, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) from the UK to access healthcare in Greece.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you live in Greece and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>You can read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-facilities">find an English-speaking doctor</a> in Greece.</p>

<p>You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Greece.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Greece will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Greece.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The UK has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Greece for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and there is no arrangement with Greece to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>You should take action now to confirm your residency status and decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. UK nationals will be able to return to UK for treatment.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal, however this is reliant on Greece continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>You should read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-greece-including-greek-islands/">healthcare in Greece</a> and how it may change after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-greece">Working in Greece</h2>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records check</a>
</li>
  <li>a Greek criminal records check, via the <a rel="external" href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_criminal_records-95-el-en.do?member=1">Penal Records Department</a> of the Ministry of Justice or your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.kep.gov.gr/portal/page/portal/kep">Citizens Service Centre (<abbr title="Citizens Service Centre">KEP</abbr>)</a> (in Greek)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="working-in-greece-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Greece after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/greece-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Greece to prevent income being taxed in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/greece/index_en.htm">paying income tax in Greece</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You will have to register for a tax identification number (AFM – pronounced aa-fee-mee) – read further guidance in the Greek government <a rel="external" href="http://www.ermis.gov.gr/portal/page/portal/ermis/FullStory?sid=240">ERMIS website</a> (in Greek), with central information and e-services. Once you have an AFM number, it is compulsory to submit a yearly tax return.</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Greece. Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greece-list-of-lawyers">an English-speaking lawyer in Greece</a>.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the EU. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial service in the EU</a>.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Greece. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire to Greece, you can claim:</p>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a ‘life certificate’ form in the post, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">you must fill it in promptly</a> otherwise your payments may be suspended.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK State Pension to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Greece, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Greek pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Greece. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">read our guidance on claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a></li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">use our tool to check which UK benefits you might be able to get while you’re abroad</a> and how to claim them</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit cannot be paid to you.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some Greek social security benefits. Please read further information on <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1112&langId=en">Greek social security benefits</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time you’ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK State Pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Greece, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Greek contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-greece">Driving in Greece</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Greece <a rel="external" href="http://www.yme.gr/index.php?aid=0&tid=282">you should exchange your UK licence for a Greek driving licence</a> (in Greek), as your licence may no longer be valid after the UK leaves the EU. You can still use your Greek licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Greece, read the guidance on:</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the European Union’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/index_en.htm">car registration and taxes</a> in Greece. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<p>If you’ve been resident in an EU country for at least 2 years before moving to Greece, you’re exempt from VAT and registration for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cars (owned and used privately)</li>
  <li>pleasure craft</li>
  <li>motorcycles</li>
  <li>mobile caravans</li>
</ul>

<p>You must appear in person at the nearest Customs Authority to request exemption from paying registration and VAT within 1 month of arriving in Greece. You’ll then be given special Greek registration plates.</p>

<p>Your vehicle must also pass a test at a <a rel="external" href="http://www.yme.gr/index.php?tid=542">Vehicle Technical Control Centre (<abbr title="Vehicle Technical Control Centre">KTEO</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="driving-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Driving after the UK leaves the EU</h3>
