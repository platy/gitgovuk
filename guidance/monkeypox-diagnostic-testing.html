<p>This guidance is aimed at healthcare workers and clinical diagnostic laboratories both in the public and private sectors.</p>
</div>

<p>Monkeypox diagnostic testing is available in UKHSA laboratories and some NHS laboratories. Where these services are available these should be accessed according to local guidance; otherwise monkeypox diagnostic testing service can be accessed through the following guidance.</p>

<p>Information is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/monkeypox-case-definitions">monkeypox case definitions</a>, and will continue to be updated. There is also information available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-contact-tracing">classification of contacts of monkeypox cases and advice for vaccination and follow-up</a>.</p>

<p>Infections such as chickenpox, <abbr title="herpes simplex virus">HSV</abbr>, molluscum contagiosum and syphilis are all still circulating. Diagnostic testing for these infections should be undertaken as usual, with testing for monkeypox proceeding in parallel if deemed necessary.</p>

<h2>Suspected cases</h2>

<p>In the first instance, suspected cases must be discussed with local infection clinicians (infectious diseases, microbiology, virology or genitourinary medicine as appropriate). Make sure that the request form indicates the risk factors and the reason that monkeypox is suspected.</p>

<h2>Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The minimum recommended <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for healthcare workers who need to be within 1 metre of a suspected case of monkeypox is droplet and contact precautions, with eye protection where there is a possibility of splash (for example taking diagnostic tests such as throat swab or deroofing lesions) as outlined in the NHSE <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-infection-prevention-and-control/" rel="external">national infection prevention and control manual</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-infection-prevention-and-control/" rel="external">national infection prevention and control manual</a> also outlines the minimum recommended level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for inpatient care.</p>

<h2>Sampling for diagnostic testing</h2>

<p>Monkeypox is diagnosed by&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test on a viral swab taken from one or more vesicles or ulcers. Swabs should be sent in viral transport media.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions below:</p>

<p>1. Ensure that you are wearing the minimum appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as above.</p>

<p>2. Take a viral swab in  viral culture medium or viral transport medium (for example Virocult®) from an open sore or from the surface of a vesicle. If other wounds are present, ensure that the sample is definitely taken from a vesicle, an ulcer or a crusted vesicle. Rub the swab over the lesion and place the swab in the viral culture tube or viral transport medium. Throat swabs are also suitable samples if there are pharyngeal lesions, atypical lesions, or if the patient is a contact of a confirmed case with a possible prodrome syndrome but without a typical rash.  Label the tube with the patient’s name and date of birth, the date and site of the sample. Note that unlabelled tubes cannot be processed.</p>

<p>3. For high risk contacts of a confirmed or highly probable case who have developed systemic symptoms but do not have a rash or lesions for sampling, you should take a throat swab in viral transport media. Note that even if the throat swab is negative, the individual must continue with monitoring and isolation as instructed by health protection, and should be reassessed and sampled if further symptoms develop.</p>

<p>4. Samples for investigation of other infections, including sexually transmitted infections, should be packaged separately, with separate request forms.</p>

<p>5. Samples should be sent to your normal local laboratory for forwarding to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl">Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (<abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>)</a> (for monkeypox testing) and for local processing (all other tests).</p>

<p>6. Samples from suspected cases of monkeypox should be sent by Category B transport.</p>

<h2>Sampling for monitoring confirmed or highly probable cases</h2>

<p>If follow-up testing is required from a confirmed or highly probable case, either because of clinical deterioration or to inform <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/de-isolation-and-discharge-of-monkeypox-infected-patients-interim-guidance">discharge from isolation to an inpatient setting</a>, additional samples should be taken and should include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lesion swab and throat swab in viral transport medium</li>
  <li>a blood sample in an EDTA tube</li>
  <li>a urine sample in a universal sterile container</li>
</ul>

<p>Samples from confirmed or highly probable cases of monkeypox should be sent by Category B transport to the High Containment Microbiology(HCM) unit at Colindale. Please contact  the HCM unit ahead of sending any samples to arrange this testing.</p>

<h2>Submitting diagnostic samples for testing</h2>

<p>1. Download and complete the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-testing-submit-sample">monkeypox testing&nbsp;request form</a>. If you require urgent reporting of results, please ensure that you provide a direct contact number for the physician designated to receive results, which may be out of hours. If you are requesting that results are emailed, please provide a relevant NHS email address. Results can only be sent to an NHS.net address.</p>

<p>2. Make sure your local microbiology team are aware that the sample is being sent and know which clinician to contact in the event of a positive result.</p>

<p>3. Package the samples carefully following the guidance on page 17 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl-user-manual"><abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> user manual</a>. You must ensure that stoppers and lids are firmly attached, the tubes are labelled with the sample type (for example swab left palm, penile lesion), patient name and date of birth. Do not use an internal study number. Samples that have leaked in transit cannot be processed.</p>

<p>4. Send the samples to your normal local laboratory. Any additional samples for sexually transmitted infections should be packaged separately. Inform your local laboratory that the samples for monkeypox testing should be forwarded for testing. This should be through a licensed Category B courier to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory  
<br>UKHSA  
<br>Manor Farm Road  
<br>Porton Down  
<br>Salisbury SP4 0JG
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>DX 6930400, Salisbury 92 SP</p>

<p>The working hours contact for <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> is 01980 612 348 from 9am to 5pm on weekdays. You can also email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ripl@ukhsa.gov.uk">ripl@ukhsa.gov.uk</a> but do not include patient identifiable information.</p>

<p>Please note that monitoring samples from confirmed cases should not be sent to <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>. Please contact Colindale HCM to arrange testing for those patients.</p>

<p>5. Samples arriving in the laboratory by 8am Monday to Saturday will usually be processed the same day. Positive results will be reported the following day. Samples arriving after 8am will be processed the next day. Routine samples arriving after 8am on Saturdays will be processed the following Monday. If urgent testing is required over the weekend, this must be discussed and agreed with the on-call Imported Fever Service consultant (0844 778 8990).</p>

<h2>Test results</h2>

<p>1. Positive results will be phoned to the designated clinicians: ensure you provide the relevant contact number for this clinician when submitting the specimen. All results will be sent to the referring laboratory through the standard electronic reporting system.</p>

<p>2. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>&nbsp;office can answer results enquiries during opening hours. If chasing a sample, ensure your courier has been contacted first to ensure that receipt of the samples has occurred. If the sample has been sent correctly via a Category B courier, the courier should be able to confirm delivery time.</p>

<h2>Information for laboratories handling samples potentially containing monkeypox virus</h2>

<p>Monkeypox is a Hazard Group (<abbr title="Hazard Group">HG</abbr>) 3 pathogen. Under normal circumstances, any procedure with HG3 pathogens involving potentially infectious material, where there is a risk of generating aerosols, droplets or splashes, must be performed within an MSC at CL3. However, some diagnostic samples may be handled at CL2 subject to local risk assessment. The following table provides the minimum containment level for handling samples suspected or confirmed to contain monkeypox.</p>

<p>Laboratory exposure may occur via needlestick injury, direct specimen contact, or inhalation of aerosols. These exposures can be avoided if standard biosafety precautions are taken.</p>

<p>It is important that other diagnostic testing is not delayed while waiting for the results of monkeypox testing so as not to delay diagnosis of other illness that may require urgent treatment.</p>

<p>Other procedures, such as extraction or procedures which may generate aerosols, should be performed in a CL3 facility with staff wearing cuffed, back-fastening gowns, gloves and goggles.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing of specimens from suspected monkeypox cases (for example testing for syphilis or <abbr title="herpes simplex virus">HSV</abbr>), the specimens should be opened in an appropriate microbiological safety cabinet in a CL2 facility.</p>

<p>Samples can be inactivated before extraction by heating for 1 hour at 60°C in a validated water-bath or block designed to ensure even heat distribution throughout standard specimen tubes.</p>

<p>Guanidine/guanidinium buffers such as AVL can also be used but work best with additional non-denaturing surfactants (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093407002959?casa_token=sty8K9R-nYAAAAAA:Ny-FmeGmmoTW6rnPD5M7GQfxmg8HZ8_c4vsfnoZxI0TFTcNLsFON06FN6IBofotN9flDxiLv8ahT" rel="external">Inactivation of orthopoxvirus for diagnostic <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> analysis by Vinner and Fomsgaard</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2014/2014-cha-procedures-inactivation-ebola.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Pan American Health Organization">PAHO</abbr>/<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> guidance</a>).</p>

<p>Inactivated samples can be handled safely with standard laboratory precautions.</p>

<p>Samples from confirmed and highly probable monkeypox cases should be labelled appropriately so that laboratories can ensure that they are handled correctly with the necessary additional precautions as outlined above.</p>

<p>For routine testing of blood samples from suspected or confirmed monkeypox cases (for example for biochemistry, haematology), standard clinical laboratory precautions can be followed, but aerosol generating procedures should be avoided. The risk of infection from these samples is less than that for hepatitis B or any other similar disease.</p>

<p>Surfaces should be decontaminated with standard disinfectants. Waste should be autoclaved and disposed of as per standard laboratory procedures.</p>

<h2>Guidance for laboratories seeking to establish monkeypox diagnostic testing capability</h2>

<p>UKHSA provides a diagnostic testing service free of charge to NHS users for public health purposes.</p>

<p>UKHSA does not restrict NHS or private laboratories from establishing their own monkeypox testing service, but any such service would be provided at their own expense.</p>

<p>Laboratories planning on establishing local diagnostic testing should ensure they remain compliant with relevant legislation, perform appropriate risk assessments, and assure ongoing quality. Laboratories should be aware that monkeypox is schedule V restricted by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2001/24/schedule/5" rel="external">Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001</a>.</p>

<p>Laboratories should also ensure that their testing provision is able to maintain compliance with the different operational definitions of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid"><abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCID</abbr></a> for monkeypox within their testing pathways, including the ability to distinguish or escalate for confirmation <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hcid-status-of-monkeypox">cases that may be classified as an <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCID</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>UKHSA does not approve, endorse or recommend a specific commercial monkeypox diagnostic test, although a monkeypox-specific nucleic acid amplification test is recommended, and use of an orthopox-only test is discouraged.</p>

<p>At present, only nucleic acid amplification tests (typically <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>-based) are recommended for provision of testing services. Other test types are available on the market, however their performance characteristics in this outbreak are uncertain and are not recommended by UKHSA.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.finddx.org/mpx-test-directory/" rel="external">list of tests on the commercial market is maintained by FIND</a>.</p>

<p>To ensure confidence and compliance with the current notifiable diseases regulation laboratories it is recommended that UK laboratories follow this process prior to commencing with a monkeypox testing service.</p>

<p>1. Submit a copy of their nucleic acid assay verification file and reporting criteria for peer review to the UKHSA monkeypox Diagnostics cell (contact details below), along with intended go live date and predicted capacity.</p>

<p>2. Technical specialists at Porton Down will provide a peer review that assay selection is reasonable for the service offered and remove the need for confirmatory testing of positive samples by <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>. This peer review is not an assay approval and laboratories should ensure they follow their standard local assay approval processes including through relevant accredited bodies.</p>

<p>3. Laboratories that have undergone satisfactory peer review are not required to submit samples to UKHSA Porton Down for confirmation.</p>

<p>4. Samples for sequencing will be required and UKHSA will arrange couriers for this if existing courier routes aren’t in place.  Minimally it is recommended that positive samples from women, children, patients with overseas travel history and/or treated with anti-viral medicines (such as tecoviramet) are retained for sequencing.</p>

<p>5. Laboratory should work with their UKHSA regional laboratory surveillance Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) leads to ensure data feeds from their laboratory systems are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notifiable-diseases-and-causative-organisms-how-to-report">reporting correctly to SGSS data system</a>.</p>

<p>6. For monitoring purposes, laboratories should provide both monkeypox negative and positive results into SGSS.</p>

<p>7. It is critical that data collection and reporting systems are in place and tested with monkeypox Data analytics teams before the service goes live to ensure this feeds into the national surveillance programme.</p>

<p>8. A turnaround time within 24 hours from sample receipt, and preferably same day, is desired.</p>

<p>If a laboratory intends to provide testing using an alternative testing methodology please contact the UKHSA monkeypox Diagnostics cell (contact details below) to discuss prior to offering a service as this may have significant implications for public health monitoring purposes.</p>

<p>UKHSA Porton Down may be able to supply control material to assist in assay verification activities (contact through the UKHSA monkeypox Diagnostics cell, see below). A monkeypox External Quality Assurance (<abbr title="External Quality Assurance">EQA</abbr>)  exercise delivered through National External Quality Assessment Services (<abbr title="National External Quality Assessment Services">NEQAS</abbr>)  is planned so submission of assay verification data can help ensure laboratories are considered for participation in that <abbr title="External Quality Assurance">EQA</abbr> exercise when it becomes available.</p>
