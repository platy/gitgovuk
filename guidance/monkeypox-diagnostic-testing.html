<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This guidance is aimed at clinical diagnostic laboratories both in the public and private sector.</p>
</div>

<p>Information is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/monkeypox-case-definitions">monkeypox case definitions</a>, and will continue to be updated. There is also information available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-contact-tracing">classification of contacts of monkeypox cases and advice for vaccination and follow-up</a>.</p>

<p>Infections such as chickenpox, <abbr title="herpes simplex virus">HSV</abbr>, molluscum contagiosum and syphilis are all still circulating. Diagnostic testing for these infections should be undertaken as usual, with testing for monkeypox proceeding in parallel if deemed necessary.</p>

<h2>Suspected cases</h2>

<p>In the first instance, suspected cases must be discussed with local infection clinicians (infectious diseases, microbiology, virology or genitourinary medicine as appropriate). Following discussion with local infection clinicians, samples from patients who clearly meet the possible or probable case definition  do not need to be discussed with the monkeypox clinical support line prior to sending. Make sure that the request form indicates the risk factors and the reason that monkeypox is suspected.</p>

<p>For cases with a degree of clinical uncertainty as to whether they meet the case definition, or for whom there is a clinical urgency, the local infection clinician (infectious diseases, microbiology, virology or genitourinary medicine) can discuss with the monkeypox clinical support line. Any calls regarding cases that have not been clinically assessed or discussed locally will be directed to contact local infection services first.</p>

<p>The monkeypox clinical helpline operates 24 hours per day for clinical emergencies only. Please consider whether your call meets this need, or whether your query can wait until working hours, and read the guidance below prior to phoning.</p>

<h2>Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The minimum recommended <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for healthcare workers who need to be within 1 metre of a suspected case of monkeypox is droplet and contact precautions, with eye protection where there is a possibility of splash (for example taking diagnostic tests such as throat swab or deroofing lesions) as outlined in the NHSE <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-infection-prevention-and-control/" rel="external">national infection prevention and control manual</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-infection-prevention-and-control/" rel="external">national infection prevention and control manual</a> also outlines the minimum recommended level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for inpatient care.</p>

<h2>Sampling for diagnostic testing</h2>

<p>Monkeypox is diagnosed by&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test on a viral swab taken from one or more vesicles or ulcers. Swabs should be sent in viral transport media.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions below:</p>

<p>1. Ensure that you are wearing the minimum appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as above.</p>

<p>2. Take a single viral swab in viral culture medium or viral transport medium (for example Virocult®) from an open sore or from the surface of a vesicle. If other wounds are present, ensure that the sample is definitely taken from a vesicle, an ulcer or a crusted vesicle. Rub the swab over the lesion and place the swab in the viral culture tube or viral transport medium. Label the tube with the patient’s name and date of birth, the date and site of the sample. Note that unlabelled tubes cannot be processed. Do not send any other sample type unless you have been requested to do so by <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> clinicians.</p>

<p>3. For high risk contacts of a confirmed case who have developed systemic symptoms but do not have a rash or lesions for sampling, you should take a throat swab in viral transport media. Note that even if the throat swab is negative, the individual must continue with monitoring and isolation as instructed, and should be reassessed and sampled if further symptoms develop.</p>

<p>4. Samples for investigation of other infections, including sexually transmitted infections, should be packaged separately, with separate request forms.</p>

<p>5. Samples should be sent to your normal local laboratory for forwarding to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl">Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (<abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>)</a> (for monkeypox testing) and for local processing (all other tests).</p>

<p>6. Samples from suspected cases of monkeypox should be sent by Category B transport.</p>

<h2>Sampling for monitoring confirmed cases</h2>

<p>If follow-up testing is required from a confirmed case, either because of clinical deterioration or for discharge planning, additional samples should be taken and should include all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lesion swab and throat swab in viral transport medium</li>
  <li>a blood sample in an EDTA tube</li>
  <li>a urine sample in a universal sterile container</li>
</ul>

<p>These samples are needed to assess clinical status and monitor progress.</p>

<p>Samples from confirmed cases of monkeypox should be sent by Category B transport to the High Containment Microbiology unit at Colindale. Separate details have been provided to <abbr title="high consequence infectious diseases">HCID</abbr> units to arrange this testing; other Infectious Disease units which require virological monitoring of patients should contact High Containment Microbiology at Colindale to arrange this testing.</p>

<h2>Submitting diagnostic samples for testing</h2>

<p>1. Download and complete the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-testing-submit-sample">monkeypox testing&nbsp;request form</a>. If you require urgent reporting of results, please ensure that you provide a direct line contact number for the physician designated to receive results, which may be out of hours. If you are requesting that results are emailed, please provide a relevant NHS email address.</p>

<p>2. Make sure your local microbiology team are aware that the sample is being sent and know which clinician to contact in the event of a positive result.</p>

<p>3. Package the samples carefully following the guidance on page 17 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl-user-manual"><abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> user manual</a>. You must ensure that stoppers and lids are firmly attached, the tubes are labelled with the sample type (for example swab left palm, penile lesion), patient name and date of birth. Do not use an internal study number. Samples that have leaked in transit cannot be processed if there is insufficient material left.</p>

<p>4. Send the samples to your normal local laboratory. Any additional samples for sexually transmitted infections should be packaged separately. Inform your local laboratory that the samples for monkeypox testing should be forwarded for testing. This should be through a licensed Category B courier to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory  
<br>UKHSA  
<br>Manor Farm Road  
<br>Porton Down  
<br>Salisbury SP4 0JG
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>DX 6930400, Salisbury 92 SP</p>

<p>The working hours contact for <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> is 01980 612 348 from 9am to 5pm on weekdays. You can also email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ripl@phe.gov.uk">ripl@phe.gov.uk</a> but do not include patient identifiable information. Outside these times, medical staff only should contact the monkeypox clinical support line for urgent clinical advice.</p>

<p>5. Samples arriving in the laboratory by 9am Monday to Saturday will usually be processed the same day. Positive results will be reported the following day. Samples arriving after 9am will be processed the next day.  Please contact the laboratory if you require the results to be provided urgently. Routine samples arriving after 9am on Saturdays will be processed the following Monday. If urgent testing is required over the weekend, this must be discussed and agreed with the on-call Imported Fever Service consultant (0844 778 8990).</p>

<p>6. For all other queries regarding patients who are seriously unwell please contact the monkeypox clinical support line on 0344 225 0602 (24 hours a day, medical practitioners only).</p>

<h2>Test results</h2>

<p>1. Positive results will be phoned to the designated clinicians: ensure you provide the relevant contact number for this clinician when submitting the specimen. All results will be sent to the referring laboratory through the standard electronic reporting system.</p>

<p>2. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>&nbsp;office can answer results enquiries during opening hours. If chasing a sample, ensure your courier has been contacted first to ensure that receipt of the samples has occurred. If the sample has been sent correctly via a Category B courier, the courier should be able to confirm delivery time.</p>

<p>3. If the patient is unwell or there are pressing infection prevention and control concerns, contact the Monkeypox Clinical Line using the details given in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#testing">Submitting diagnostic samples for testing</a> section.</p>

<h2>Information for laboratories handling samples potentially containing monkeypox virus</h2>

<p>Monkeypox is a Hazard Group (<abbr title="Hazard Group">HG</abbr>) 3 pathogen. Under normal circumstances, any procedure with HG3 pathogens involving potentially infectious material, where there is a risk of generating aerosols, droplets or splashes, must be performed within an MSC at CL3. However, some diagnostic samples may be handled at CL2 subject to local risk assessment. The following table provides the minimum containment level for handling samples suspected or confirmed to contain monkeypox.</p>

<p>Laboratory exposure may occur via needlestick injury, direct specimen contact, or inhalation of aerosols. These exposures can be avoided if standard biosafety precautions are taken.</p>

<p>It is important that other diagnostic testing is not delayed while waiting for the results of monkeypox testing so as not to delay diagnosis of other illness that may require urgent treatment.</p>

<p>Other procedures, such as extraction or procedures which may generate aerosols, should be performed in a CL3 facility with staff wearing cuffed, back-fastening gowns, gloves and goggles.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing of specimens from suspected monkeypox cases (for example testing for syphilis or <abbr title="herpes simplex virus">HSV</abbr>), the specimens should be opened in an appropriate microbiological safety cabinet in a CL2 facility.</p>

<p>Samples can be inactivated before extraction by heating for 1 hour at 60°C in a validated water-bath or block designed to ensure even heat distribution throughout standard specimen tubes.</p>

<p>Guanidine/guanidinium buffers such as AVL can also be used but work best with additional non-denaturing surfactants (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093407002959?casa_token=sty8K9R-nYAAAAAA:Ny-FmeGmmoTW6rnPD5M7GQfxmg8HZ8_c4vsfnoZxI0TFTcNLsFON06FN6IBofotN9flDxiLv8ahT" rel="external">Inactivation of orthopoxvirus for diagnostic <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> analysis by Vinner and Fomsgaard</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2014/2014-cha-procedures-inactivation-ebola.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Pan American Health Organization">PAHO</abbr>/<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> guidance</a>).</p>

<p>Inactivated samples can be handled safely with standard laboratory precautions.</p>

<p>Samples from confirmed monkeypox cases should be labelled appropriately so that laboratories can ensure that they are handled correctly with the necessary additional precautions as outlined above.</p>

<p>For routine testing of blood samples from suspected or confirmed monkeypox cases (for example for biochemistry, haematology), standard clinical laboratory precautions can be followed, but aerosol generating procedures should be avoided. The risk of infection from these samples is less than that for hepatitis B or any other similar disease.</p>

<p>Surfaces should be decontaminated with standard disinfectants. Waste should be autoclaved and disposed of as per standard laboratory procedures.</p>
