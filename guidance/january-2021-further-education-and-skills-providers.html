<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On 17 March 2020, all routine inspections were suspended due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. As part of our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/education-plans-from-september-2020" class="govuk-link">phased return to routine inspection</a>, we carried out interim visits and monitoring visits to further education and skills providers from 28 September 2020. This enabled us to work with leaders and those responsible for governance to understand the impact of COVID-19 and report on this as part of our national research programme.</p>

<p>When the national lockdown came into effect on 5 January 2021, it was necessary to limit inspection activity to progress monitoring visits that could be carried out remotely (while allowing for a face-to-face element where necessary to address particular concerns).</p>

<p>Following the government’s announcement about the return to on-site education from 8 March and the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s guidance setting out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-further-education-provision" class="govuk-link">what this means for FE colleges and providers</a>, we have reviewed our face-to-face inspection activity in further education and skills providers. Full and short inspections will remain suspended for the time being.</p>

<p>In the meantime, from 15 March 2021, we will carry out new provider monitoring visits (<abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr>) to new providers that have not yet received a monitoring visit. These <abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> will be face to face although it may be necessary to carry out some meetings, discussions or other aspects remotely. We will discontinue progress monitoring visits (<abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr>) other than in exceptional cases. For example, we may do this when it has already been necessary to engage additional planning and resources for a visit and we believe that to be the most appropriate means of monitoring progress at this time.</p>

<p>We will continue to carry out emergency monitoring visits or inspections if we have a significant cause for concern, such as about safeguarding or a breakdown in leadership and management. We will continue to carry these out on site, wherever possible.</p>

<h2>The legal context</h2>

<p>We will carry out <abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr>, <abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> and emergency monitoring visits (or full inspections if we have a significant cause for concern) under <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/40/part/8" class="govuk-link">Part 8 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006</a>.</p>

<h2>Monitoring visits</h2>

<h3>New provider monitoring visits</h3>

<p>From 15 March 2021, we will return to carrying out <abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> to new providers that have not yet received a monitoring visit. We consider this group to be the highest priority for face-to-face inspection activity.</p>

<p>The Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>) will take into account the outcome of these <abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> when making <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/removal-from-register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers">intervention decisions</a> as usual, such as about apprenticeships starts and registration.</p>

<p><abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> will be carried out in the same way as before the suspension of routine  inspection activity and in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif">inspection handbook</a>, unless otherwise indicated below.</p>

<p>We will not carry out an <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr> to any provider that has level 6 and/or 7 apprenticeships provision before 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>The impact of COVID-19 will be taken into account in the findings and progress judgements.</p>

<h4>Themes covered</h4>

<p>Inspectors will make the usual progress judgements for monitoring visits (insufficient/reasonable/significant) against the usual 3 themes.</p>

<p>In each case, inspectors will review progress:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in leadership and management</li>
  <li>in providing high-quality education or training</li>
  <li>towards ensuring effective safeguarding arrangements</li>
</ul>

<p>If a provider has more than one type of provision (for example, apprenticeships and adult learning), each type of provision will be covered by a separate theme and progress judgement.</p>

<h4>Progress judgements</h4>

<p>We will use the following progress judgements for each theme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>insufficient progress: progress has been either slow or insubstantial or both, and the demonstrable impact on learners has been negligible</li>
  <li>reasonable progress: the provider’s actions are already having a beneficial impact on learners, and improvements are sustainable and are based on the provider’s thorough quality assurance procedures</li>
  <li>significant progress: progress has been rapid and is already having considerable beneficial impact on learners</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>

<p>We will give up to 2 working days’ notice of an <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>. We will normally notify the provider in the morning of the notification day with an email which includes the notification letter. Following this initial notification, the lead inspector will call the chief executive officer (<abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr>) or equivalent.</p>

<p>A provider may request a deferral of an <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>. We will decide whether a deferral should be granted in accordance with our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferring-ofsted-inspections">deferral policy</a>. The lead inspector will liaise with the provider to ensure that, wherever possible, the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr> can go ahead.</p>

<p>The lead inspector will discuss with the provider the inspectors’ schedule and the activities that inspectors will carry out face to face and those they plan to carry out by remote means, such as telephone and video conferencing calls.</p>

<p>We will invite each provider to nominate a senior member of staff to act as the main link with the inspectors carrying out the visit.</p>

<p><abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> will normally last 2 days.</p>

<h4>During the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>
</h4>

<p><abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> will be carried out face to face but as usual, it may be necessary to carry out some meetings, discussions or other aspects of the visit remotely.</p>

<h5>Feedback to leaders</h5>

<p>At the end of the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>, the lead inspector will provide final feedback to the nominee, <abbr title="chief executive officer">CEO</abbr> or equivalent and any senior leaders that the provider elects to attend. Relevant officers from the <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> and the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) may join the feedback meeting. Where appropriate, the Greater London Authority (<abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>) or appropriate mayoral and combined authorities (<abbr title="mayoral and combined authorities">MCAs</abbr>) may also join the meeting.</p>

<p>The findings are provisional and may be subject to change through quality assurance and will be generally reflected in the report. We may share them with the Further Education Commissioner, <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (<abbr title="Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation">Ofqual</abbr>), Office for Students (<abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>), <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>, <abbr title="mayoral and combined authorities">MCAs</abbr> or other relevant regulators/inspectorates before we publish the report.</p>

<h4>After the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>
</h4>

<h5>Report to the provider</h5>

<p><abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> will result in a brief published report. Within 18 working days of the end of the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>, we will write to the provider, setting out in a draft report what inspectors found. This will have been quality assured. We may share the draft report or findings with other public bodies.</p>

<p>The provider will have 5 working days to comment on the draft report, inspection process and findings. We will consider all comments and we will respond to them when we share the final report with the provider within a maximum of 30 working days of the end of the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>, although it may be sooner.</p>

<p>If the provider wishes to submit a formal complaint, it will have until the end of the fifth working day after receiving the final report to do so.</p>

<p>We will normally publish the report on our <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/">reports website</a> within 38 working days of the end of the <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr>. We may delay the publication of the report if a complaint is being investigated.</p>

<h5>Post-visit surveys</h5>

<p>Following the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>, we will ask providers for feedback about the process through a survey. We provide details about how providers can share their views when we send the final report.</p>

<h5>Quality assurance</h5>

<p>We will monitor the quality of the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> through a range of formal processes. We may remotely monitor evidence to quality assure the inspectors’ work; if necessary, this may need an on-site visit to the provider. We will quality assure evidence bases and reports.</p>

<h5>The evidence base</h5>

<p>The evidence base for the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr> will be retained in line with Ofsted’s retention and disposal policy. This is normally for 6 years from when the report is published. We may decide that retaining it for longer is warranted for research purposes.</p>

<h4>Conduct and complaints</h4>

<p>Inspectors must uphold the highest professional standards in their work and treat everyone they encounter during <abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> fairly and with respect and sensitivity.</p>

<p>Inspectors must at all times adhere to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conduct-during-ofsted-inspections">code of conduct for inspections</a>. Any concerns and complaints during the visit will be handled in line with Ofsted’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/complaints-procedure" class="govuk-link">complaints policy</a>.</p>

<h4>Incomplete inspections</h4>

<p>We will apply our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gathering-additional-evidence-to-secure-an-incomplete-inspection">policy on incomplete inspections</a> where appropriate.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr> next stages</h4>

<p>Following the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr>, a provider will normally receive a full inspection usually within 24 months of the publication date of the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr> report (provided it continues to be funded). However, if one or more of the progress judgements is ‘insufficient’, it will normally receive the full inspection within 6 to 12 months of the publication date of the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr> report.</p>

<p>If the progress judgement for the safeguarding theme (theme 3) is ‘insufficient’, the provider will normally receive a monitoring visit covering only safeguarding within 4 months of the publication date of the <abbr title="new provider monitoring visit">NPMV</abbr> report.</p>

<h3>Progress monitoring visits (<abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>From 15 March 2021, we may carry out <abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> in exceptional circumstances. For example, we may do this when it has been necessary to engage additional planning and resources for a visit and we believe that to be the most appropriate means of monitoring progress at this time.</p>

<p>We may carry out these <abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providers judged to require improvement for overall effectiveness that have not yet received a monitoring visit since their previous full inspection</li>
  <li>providers judged inadequate for overall effectiveness that have not yet received a monitoring visit since their previous full inspection or that are due their second re-inspection monitoring visit (if they continue to be publicly funded)</li>
  <li>new providers (as defined by the inspection handbook, paragraph 14), that are due a full inspection and received a new provider monitoring visit 2 years ago or more (subject to a provider’s individual circumstances)</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also carry out <abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> to other providers.</p>

<p>We will carry out <abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif">inspection handbook</a>, unless otherwise indicated below.</p>

<p><abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> follow the guidance set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif">inspection handbook</a>, paragraphs 24–26. They will focus on the progress leaders and those responsible for governance are making in taking effective action to provide education in the current circumstances. They will report on the extent of improvements since the last inspection.</p>

<p>Inspecting providers remotely limits our ability to provide the same level of assurance that on-site activity would provide.</p>

<p>The operational guidance for <abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> follows what we have set out above for <abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr>, except in the cases below.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr> coverage and progress judgement</h4>

<p>Inspectors will make a progress judgement (insufficient/reasonable/significant) against the following overall theme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What progress are leaders and those responsible for governance making to ensure that staff teach a curriculum and provide support to meet learners’ needs, including the provision of remote/online learning?</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a particular focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improvements since the previous inspection (for requires improvement and inadequate providers)</li>
  <li>improvements since the new provider monitoring visit (for new providers)</li>
  <li>the quality of education being provided (including on-site and remote/online education)</li>
  <li>the effectiveness of support for students</li>
</ul>

<p>The impact of COVID-19 will be taken into account in the findings and progress judgement.</p>

<p>As usual, the categories of progress judgement are defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>insufficient progress: progress has been either slow or insubstantial or both, and the demonstrable impact on learners has been negligible</li>
  <li>reasonable progress: the provider’s actions are already having a beneficial impact on learners, and improvements are sustainable and are based on the provider’s thorough quality assurance procedures</li>
  <li>significant progress: progress has been rapid and is already having considerable beneficial impact on learners</li>
</ul>

<h4>During the <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr>
</h4>

<p>We will normally carry out inspection activities remotely.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to carry out aspects of the visit on site if serious concerns warrant it. Where inspectors have concerns about safeguarding or a serious breakdown in leadership and management, it is likely that the activity will move on site or the <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr> may be declared incomplete and completed on site at a later date.</p>

<p>Should it be necessary for an inspector to go on site, inspectors will take all reasonable steps to work within the provider’s COVID-19 systems and processes, in line with government guidelines.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr> next stages</h4>

<p>Following the <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr>, a requires improvement provider would receive a requires improvement monitoring visit (<abbr title="requires improvement monitoring visit">RIMV</abbr>), following normal arrangements. However, these providers may choose to forgo their <abbr title="requires improvement monitoring visit">RIMV</abbr> and go straight to a full re-inspection as their next inspection activity.</p>

<p>Following their <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr>, inadequate providers would normally receive a re-inspection monitoring visit (<abbr title="re-inspection monitoring visit">RMV</abbr>), following normal arrangements. However, these providers may choose to forgo their <abbr title="re-inspection monitoring visit">RMV</abbr> (or both <abbr title="re-inspection monitoring visits">RMVs</abbr> if they are due 2 visits) and go straight to the full re-inspection as their next inspection activity.</p>

<p>For all other providers, following a <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr>, they will receive whatever inspection they would expect under normal arrangements. For example, a new provider that has already had a new provider monitoring visit will normally receive a full inspection as its next inspection activity. A good provider will normally receive a short or full inspection following a <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr> as their next inspection activity.</p>

<p>We will take into account the outcome of the <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr> when reviewing the timing of the next full inspection.</p>

<h3>Other monitoring visits</h3>

<p>If we have significant cause for concern, such as about safeguarding or a breakdown in leadership and management, we may carry out a monitoring visit to any provider at any reasonable time. These monitoring visits will normally result in a progress judgement against each theme covered, and a brief published report, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif">inspection handbook</a>. We may only cover the theme causing concern, if appropriate. Concerns arising from monitoring visits may lead to an early full inspection.</p>

<p>The processes set out above relating to <abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr> will normally apply.</p>

<h2>Privacy notice</h2>

<p>During <abbr title="new provider monitoring visits">NPMVs</abbr>, <abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> and emergency monitoring visits (or full inspections if we have a significant cause for concern), inspectors may collect information about staff and learners by talking to them, visiting lessons and/or training sessions (whether in person or remotely) and by looking at documents and other recorded information. Inspectors may also meet with employers, where appropriate. We will use this information to prepare a brief report and as set out in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsted-privacy-notices/further-education-and-skills-ofsted-privacy-notice">further education and skills privacy notice</a>.</p>
