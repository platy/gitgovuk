<h2>Book and plan your visit to Nottingham prison</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>January 2022 update</h3>

<p>HMP Nottingham is now offering visits for family, friends and significant others.</p>

<p>Visitors aged 12 and over need to take a lateral flow device test (LFD) before coming for their visit. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic#testing">Find out more here</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of other ways to <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">contact someone in prison if you are unable to visit them</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Nottingham Prison you must:</p>

<p>There is a limit to the number of visits a person can have.</p>

<p>If the prisoner is on remand they can have 3 visits a week. If the prisoner has been convicted (they have been sentenced or are awaiting sentencing) they can have up to 4 visits a month, depending on their behaviour level and privileges they have earned.</p>

<h3>Entering Nottingham Prison</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>You must be at the prison gates no later than 10:30am for weekday morning visits and 3:30pm for afternoon visits. On weekend mornings it’s no later than 11am. If you’re later than these times, you will not be allowed to enter.</p>

<p>You may have your finger or thumb prints scanned as part of a security check. You may also have an iris scan. All visitors, apart from children, will have their photo taken.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a rub-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Nottingham Prison has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes (no vests, no high-visibility clothing, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses, no offensive logos and no scarves, gloves or headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>Each adult visitor is allowed to take in a maximum of £20 in coins (notes are not allowed). The money can be used to buy food and drink from the snack bar in the visiting hall.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Nottingham Prison. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker (you will need a £1 coin) or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You can take in baby milk, nappies and wipes, but the milk must either be sealed in its original container or mixed up in front of visitors centre staff using water provided. All baby items must be in a clear plastic bag.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Nottingham Prison</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Nottingham Prison.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms and are able to make calls at any time during phone hours. They have to buy phone credits to do this. Phones do not accept incoming calls so they will always have to call you.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Nottingham Prison using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Nottingham.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Nottingham Prison</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Nottingham Prison who are on enhanced behaviour levels are given a list of approved items that they can buy from a catalogue.</p>

<p>All prisoners must apply to have clothes brought into the prison. If approved, you can hand in prescription glasses and certain items of clothing to prison staff when you attend for your visit. Items can only be received by a designated officer in the visitors centre before your visit starts.</p>

<p>Family and friends of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
