<h2>&nbsp;What the Register of Overseas Entities is</h2>

<p>The Register of Overseas Entities came into force in the UK on 1 August 2022 through the new Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022.</p>

<p>Overseas entities who want to buy, sell or transfer property or land in the UK, must register with Companies House and tell us who their registrable beneficial owners or managing officers are.</p>

<p>This will also apply retrospectively to overseas entities who bought property or land on or after:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 January 1999 in England and Wales</li>
  <li>8 December 2014 in Scotland</li>
</ul>

<p>These overseas entities will need to register with Companies House and tell us who their registrable beneficial owners or managing officers are by 31 January 2023.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Overseas entities only need to register property or land bought in Northern Ireland on or after 1 August 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>Entities that disposed of property or land after 28 February 2022 will also need to register and give details of that disposal.</p>

<p>After registering, the overseas entity will get a unique Overseas Entity ID to give to the Land Registry when it buys, sells, transfers, leases or charges UK property or land.</p>

<p>This will lead to more transparency, which will allow law enforcement agencies to investigate suspicious wealth more effectively.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you do not comply with the Act, you could be fined up to Â£2,500 per day or get a prison sentence of up to 5 years. Youâ€™ll also face restrictions when buying, selling, transferring, leasing or charging property or land in the UK.</p>
</div>

<h2>&nbsp;What an overseas entity is</h2>

<p>This is a legal entity, such as a company or other organisation, that has legal personality and is governed by the law of a country or territory outside the UK. The Republic of Ireland is an overseas jurisdiction for the Register of Overseas Entities.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;What a beneficial owner is</h2>

<p>A beneficial owner is any individual or entity that has significant influence or control over the overseas entity. It can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an individual person</li>
  <li>another legal entity, such as a company</li>
  <li>a government or public authority</li>
  <li>a trustee of a trust</li>
  <li>a member of a firm that is not a legal person under its governing law</li>
</ul>

<p>You must register any beneficial owner that meets one or more of the following conditions known as the â€˜natures of controlâ€™.</p>

<p><strong>The beneficial owner is an individual person, other legal entity, government or public authority and:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>holds, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the shares in the entity</li>
  <li>holds, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the voting rights in the entity</li>
  <li>holds the right, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors of the entity</li>
  <li>has the right to exercise, or actually exercises, significant influence or control over the entity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The beneficial owner is a trustee of a trust and:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>the trustees of that trust (in their capacity as such) hold, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the shares in the entity</li>
  <li>the trustees of that trust (in their capacity as such) hold, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the voting rights in the entity</li>
  <li>the trustees of that trust (in their capacity as such) hold the right, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors of the company</li>
  <li>the trustees of that trust (in their capacity as such) have the right to exercise, or actually exercise, significant influence or control over the company</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The beneficial owner is a member of a firm that is not a legal person under its governing law and:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>the members of that firm (in their capacity as such) hold, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the shares in the entity</li>
  <li>the members of that firm (in their capacity as such) hold, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the voting rights in the entity</li>
  <li>the members of that firm (in their capacity as such) hold the right, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors of the company</li>
  <li>the members of that firm (in their capacity as such) have the right to exercise, or actually exercise, significant influence or control over the company</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>A firm is a partnership, unincorporated association or other entity that is not a legal person under the law by which it is governed.</p>
</div>

<h2>&nbsp;Who can use this service</h2>

<p>You can use this service if you work at, or work on behalf of, the overseas entity.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s quicker and easier for an overseas entity to be registered by the same UK-regulated agent that carried out its <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-is-needed-for-verification-checks">verification checks</a>. These can include financial institutions and legal professionals.</p>

<p>You may not be able to use this service if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any beneficial owners have their personal information protected at Companies House (or are waiting for the results of an application)</li>
  <li>the overseas entity has disposed of UK property or land since 28 February 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk">enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> for further guidance.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;What information you need to submit</h2>

<p>Youâ€™ll need to provide information about the overseas entity, any registrable beneficial owners, and the UK-regulated agent that carried out <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-is-needed-for-verification-checks">verification checks</a>.

  <li>public register it appears on and its registration number (if it has one)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the entity has disposed of UK property or land since 28 February 2022, it will also need to tell us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the deed or title number of the land or property</li>
  <li>the date that the land or property was disposed of</li>
  <li>details of any additional beneficial owners or managing officers at the time the land or property was disposed of</li>

<p>Itâ€™s important to complete the Excel document before you start using this service, as the service will time out if you do not use it for 60 minutes.</p>
</div>

<h2>&nbsp;What is needed for verification checks</h2>

<p>A UK-regulated agent must complete verification checks on all beneficial owners and managing officers of an overseas entity before it can be registered. It will need to provide an agent assurance code and an overseas entity verification checks statement to confirm that it has done this.</p>

<p>They must be based in the UK and supervised under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017. They can be an individual or a corporate entity, such as a financial institution or legal professional.</p>

<p>Verification checks must be completed no more than 3 months before the overseas entity is registered.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Agent assurance code</h3>

<p>The UK-regulated agent will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agent-assurance-codes">request an agent assurance code from Companies House</a>. This confirms that the agent has authorisation to file verification checks statements for an overseas entity. We cannot register an overseas entity without a code. You can apply for an agent assurance code from Monday 25 July 2022.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Overseas entity verification checks statement</h3>

<p>If the UK-regulated agent that carried out the verification checks is also registering the overseas entity, it can complete this statement as part of the registration service. Otherwise, it will need to submit an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agent-assurance-codes#how-to-use-the-code">Overseas entity verification checks statement</a>.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;What information will be shown on the public register</h2>

<p>Most of the information given to Companies House about overseas entities, beneficial owners and managing officers will be publicly available on the Register of Overseas Entities.</p>

<p>We will not show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>home addresses</li>
  <li>full dates of birth - only the month and year will be shown</li>
  <li>the agent assurance code</li>
  <li>the date verification checks were completed</li>
  <li>information about trusts, however it may be shared with HMRC</li>
  <li>email addresses</li>
</ul>

<h2>&nbsp;Apply to register an overseas entity and its beneficial owners</h2>

<p>Youâ€™ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to sign in to or create a Companies House account</li>
  <li>to give us the name and email address of someone we can contact about the application</li>
  <li>to give <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-information-you-need-to-submit">information about the overseas entity and its beneficial owners or managing officers</a>

<h2>&nbsp;What happens after an overseas entity is registered</h2>

<p>If the application is accepted, the overseas entity and its beneficial owners and managing officers will be added to the Register of Overseas Entities.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll also email the notice of registration to the overseas entity. This will include the Overseas Entity ID, which must be given to the Land Registry whenever the entity buys, sells or transfers land or property in the UK.</p>

<p>If the application is rejected, weâ€™ll email you to let you know what to do next and refund the Â£100 registration fee.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Updating information on the register</h3>

<p>The overseas entity must file an annual update one year after it was registered, and every year after that. This will be used to tell us about any changes, or confirm that the information we hold is still correct. It must be filed no later than 14 days after the due date. It can also file earlier if it needs to update any information.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Removing an overseas entity</h3>

<p>An overseas entity can apply to be removed from the Register of Overseas Entities if it is not, or is no longer, a registered owner of land or property in the UK.</p>

<p>The sections of The Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 relating to updates and removal have not yet come into force. This means that updates and removal applications can only be made once this happens.</p>
