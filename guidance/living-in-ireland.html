<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Ireland see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ireland/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sign up for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-ireland" class="govuk-link">email alerts on living in Ireland</a>
</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.dfa.ie/brexit/" class="govuk-link">Irish governmentâ€™s website</a> for UK citizens living in Ireland.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>UK citizens do not need a visa or residency permit to live, work or study in Ireland. Under the Common Travel Area (<abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>), UK and Irish citizens can live and work freely in each otherâ€™s countries and travel freely between them. Both the UK and Irish governments are committed to protecting the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>. Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance/common-travel-area-guidance" class="govuk-link">guidance on the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Irelandâ€™s Citizens Information service has <a href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">advice about moving to and living in Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) has <a rel="external" href="http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/EU%20Treaty%20Rights" class="govuk-link">advice on the requirements for non-EU/EEA family members</a> of UK citizens.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>Your travel rights for Ireland continue through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance/common-travel-area-guidance" class="govuk-link">Common Travel Area</a>. 
Travel between the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Ireland.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including travel between the UK and Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the UK will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-ireland" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to access healthcare in Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>, UK citizens who live in Ireland have the right to access healthcare in Ireland. When visiting, UK citizens also have the right to access medically necessary healthcare.</p>

<p>Find a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/acutehospitals/hospitals/hospitallist.html">list of hospitals and doctors in Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>Paying for healthcare</h3>

<p>You may need to pay a fee to access public healthcare in Ireland on the same basis as Irish citizens. However, you may be eligible for a means tested medical card. If you do not qualify for a medical card on income grounds, you may qualify for a GP Visit card.</p>

<p>Read the Irish governmentâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/gp_visit_cards.html">guidance on how to apply for medical and GP cards</a>.</p>

<p>You can also take out <a rel="external" href="https://www.hia.ie/" class="govuk-link">private health insurance</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Ireland and get an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit. You will usually need to show some evidence of your entitlement to healthcare in Ireland, such as proof of property rental or ownership. If eligible, youâ€™ll need a medical card that entitles you to receive certain health services free of charge.</p>

<h2>Working in Ireland</h2>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>, UK citizens do not need a visa or residency permit to live, work or study in Ireland.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" rel="external">UK criminal records check</a>. You can also get a <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/leaving_ireland/police_certificate.html" class="govuk-link">police certificate</a> from the GardaÃ­.</p>

<p>Read the Irish governmentâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/">Citizens Information on employment</a>.</p>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>If you had your qualifications recognised by the relevant regulator before 1 January 2021, there will be no change and you can continue to practise in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU.</p>

<p>If you have not yet had your professional qualifications recognised, you should contact the competent authority for that profession in Ireland to find out if you need to take any action.</p>

<p>For help with this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the Irish governmentâ€™s&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/starting_work/Recognition_of_professional_qualifications_in_ireland.html#l59fac" class="govuk-link">guidance on the recognition of professional qualifications</a>
</li>
  <li>contact the relevant regulatory body for your profession</li>
</ul>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>UK bank cards are widely accepted for transactions in Ireland.</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Ireland.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/" rel="external">Citizens Information tax guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/Home.aspx">Revenue.ie guidance</a> on tax in Ireland.</p>

<h3>National Insurance</h3>

<p>The UK and Irish governments have a bilateral agreement to ensure that social security rights, including existing arrangements for social insurance contributions continue to be protected.</p>

<h3>Banking</h3>

<p>Whether UK banks can provide services to customers living in the EEA is a matter of local law and regulation. Your bank or finance provider should contact you if they need to make any changes to your product or the way they provide it. If you have any concerns about whether you might be affected, contact your provider or seek independent financial advice.</p>

<p>Read the Money and Pension Service <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/brexit-banking-insurance-finance" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on banking, insurance and financial services changes</a> for more information on cross-border banking.</p>

<h2>Pensions</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your pension if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national living in or working in Ireland, working in both the UK and Ireland, or working across the border, you are subject to only one stateâ€™s social security legislation at a time. This means you can access your pension from whichever state you are subject to the social security legislation of, regardless of where you are living.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad" class="govuk-link">State Pension if you retire abroad</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">new State Pension</a>.</p>

<p>If you have worked in Ireland, you can apply to the <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/a-retired-or-an-older-person.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection</a>. If you have not worked in Ireland, you can claim your UK State Pension by contacting the International Pension Centre. If you have worked in several EU countries, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances" class="govuk-link">state pensions abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you are getting a UK State Pension and receive a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances" class="govuk-link">â€˜life certificateâ€™ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible â€“ your payments may be suspended if you do not.</p>

<p>The UK and Irish governments have a bilateral agreement to ensure social security rights, including access to pensions. This agreement means that there will be no change to the payment of your UK State Pension in Ireland. UK State Pensions will continue to be paid, including upratings.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>If you are living in or working in Ireland, working in both the UK and Ireland, or working across the border, you are subject to only one stateâ€™s social security legislation at a time. This means you can access social security benefits from whichever state you are subject to the social security legislation of, regardless of where you are living.</p>

<p>You also have the right to access social security benefits on the same basis as citizens of the state you are in.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit cannot be paid if youâ€™re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<h3>Irish benefits</h3>

<p>The criteria to claim certain Irish social security benefits differ from those in the UK. If you meet Irelandâ€™s 5 requirements for determining habitual residence then you may be eligible to claim some Irish social security benefits.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Habitual-Residence-Condition--Guidelines-for-Deciding-Offic.aspx#sect6">Irish Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection guidance</a> and the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/">Irish governmentâ€™s guidance on Irish social welfare payments</a>.</p>

<p>The UK and Irish governments have a bilateral agreement to ensure that social security rights, including access to social security benefits and entitlements continue to be protected.</p>

<h2>Driving in Ireland</h2>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ndls.ie/licensed-driver/exchange-my-uk-ni-licence.html">exchange your UK driving licence for an Irish one</a>.</p>

<p>If you are visiting Ireland, you can drive with your existing UK driving licence.</p>

<h2>Pets</h2>

<p>Pet travel rules for taking your pet to Great Britain, Europe and Northern Ireland have not changed.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re travelling with your pet for the first time, you must visit your vet to get a pet passport.</p>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pet-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">guidance on pet travel to NI and Europe</a>.</p>

<p>If you are travelling to Great Britain with your pet and are planning on re-entering Ireland afterwards, you should contact your vet to make sure your animal has all the health preparation it needs.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bring-pet-to-uk" class="govuk-link">guidance on bringing your pet to Great Britain</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/pets/" class="govuk-link">Irish governmentâ€™s guidance on pet travel</a>.</p>
