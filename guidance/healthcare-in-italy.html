<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Italy.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>This information is about living in Italy. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Italy</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>UK nationals living in Italy usually access the Italian health system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registering to use the Italian state health system</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with the Italian health system</li>
</ul>

<p>You have to pay to use parts of the healthcare system, although some parts are free.</p>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Italy</h2>
<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-italy" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> to access state healthcare in Italy.</p>

<p>If you’re employed or self-employed you can register with the national health system for free. This is called ‘iscrizione obbligatoria’.</p>

<p>You can register your dependants at the same time.</p>

<p>If you are not working or paying social security contributions, you may be able to register with the national health system voluntarily by paying a fee each year (‘iscrizione volontaria’).</p>

<p>If you do not register with the Italian health system using either of the above routes, you’ll need to take out private health insurance.</p>

<p>If you’re registered under ‘iscrizione obbligatoria’, you may be entitled to an Italian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> (‘TEAM’ in Italian) for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You cannot get an Italian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> if you’re registered voluntarily.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register for healthcare</h3>
<p>First, apply for a permit of stay at the immigration office and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-italy" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a>.</p>

<p>If you started living in Italy before 1 January 2021, you must register as a resident.</p>

<p>Then register for healthcare at your local health authority (Azienda Sanitaria Locale or <abbr title="Azienda Sanitaria Locale">ASL</abbr>).</p>

<p>You’ll need your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residency certificate, permit of stay or application receipt</li>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>tax code (codice fiscale)</li>
  <li>evidence of your dependants, such as a translated marriage certificate or birth certificate (if you’re registering your spouse or children)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re registering your family members, check with your <abbr title="Azienda Sanitaria Locale">ASL</abbr> if you need to provide evidence that they’re economically dependent on you.</p>

<p>If you’re employed or self-employed, you’ll also need to bring evidence of your employment status, such as a work contract, to prove you’re eligible to register for free.</p>

<p>If you’re registering voluntarily (if you are not working, not paying social security contributions and not registering for healthcare as someone’s dependant), you’ll need to pay a fee to register.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Azienda Sanitaria Locale">ASL</abbr> will tell you how much to pay and how to pay it. Show your proof of payment at your local health authority when you complete your registration.</p>

<p>Once you’ve registered for healthcare:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can register with a GP</li>
  <li>you’ll receive a health card (which includes your Italian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> if you’re registered with the obligatory scheme)</li>
  <li>you may be able to apply for co-payments exemption if you have a chronic condition or low income</li>
</ul>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>Once you’ve registered for healthcare, the following are free:</p>

<ul>
  <li>emergency care</li>
  <li>hospital admission</li>
  <li>GP appointments</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to pay a co-payment, called ‘Ticket’, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>specialist referrals</li>
  <li>diagnostic tests</li>
  <li>prescription medicines, unless you’re registered as exempt, for example because of a chronic medical condition</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Italy temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Italy using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Italy</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-italy">living in Italy</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Italy before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it with your local health authority.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Italy on the same basis as an Italian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also be able to get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Italy than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Italy</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 form with your local health authority. You will need your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>tax identification number (codice fiscale)</li>
  <li>residency certificate, permit of stay or application receipt</li>
</ul>

<p>Once registered, you will receive a health card, valid throughout Italy. This will mean you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as an Italian citizen.</p>

<p>You can register with a GP and apply for co-payment exemption if you qualify.</p>

<h2>Studying in Italy</h2>
<p>You can use an <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period in Italy.</p>

<p>As part of the immigration process you may have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay for private health insurance</li>
  <li>register voluntarily with your local health authority and pay a reduced student fee of around 150 euros for the year</li>
</ul>

<p>Speak to your university for advice.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
