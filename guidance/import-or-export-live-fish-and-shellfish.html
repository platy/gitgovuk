<h2>Authorisation to import live fish and shellfish</h2>

<p>You need authorisation from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/fish-health-inspectorate">Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>), Cefas</a> to import live fish, molluscs and crustaceans for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ornamental purposes</li>
  <li>farming</li>
  <li>human consumption</li>
  <li>scientific research</li>
  <li>‘put and take’ fisheries (where catches can be taken home)</li>
  <li>public aquariums and zoos</li>
  <li>spas and medical use (nibble fish)</li>
</ul>

<p>All sources must be approved by the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> who will check that the source country you are importing from is approved and can meet the animal health certification requirements for import into the GB.</p>

<p>You can get an unlimited fine if you import fish or shellfish without authorisation.</p>

<h2>Importing into England and Wales from an EU country</h2>

<p>From 1 January there are new processes that importers must follow, which are being introduced in stages. There are two stages applicable to live fish and shellfish (including their eggs and gametes) that are not moving as product for direct human consumption.</p>

<h3>Rules from 1 January 2021:</h3>

<p>To import live fish and shellfish into GB (England and Wales) from the EU:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your goods must be accompanied by an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fish-health-certificates">animal health certificate</a> using the correct template for imports from the EU. The certificate must confirm that the goods meet the animal health requirements for entry into England and Wales. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/fish-health-inspectorate">Contact the Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr>)</a> in advance of making any import arrangements to confirm the health certification requirements and the correct template to use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the animal health certificate must be issued and completed by the Competent Authority responsible for aquatic animal health at the source site, your supplier should make this arrangement with them. The original, signed certificate must accompany the consignment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you or your Agent must use the UK’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system">Import of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System (IPAFFS)</a> to pre-notify the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> of your import at least one working day before the consignment is due to arrive. You can submit your notification up to 30 days in advance. You will need to give the EU exporter or their official veterinarian/ fish health inspector the unique notification number (UNN) that is produced on IPAFFS so it can be added to the health certificate which accompanies the consignment. You also need to upload a copy of the health certificate onto IPAFFS in advance of the import. Allow time for this when making the IPAFFS pre-notification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the event that the original, stamped and signed export health certificate is not present on IPAFFS in advance of the import leaving the source site, the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will contact the importer to request the missing documentation is
uploaded to IPAFFS urgently. Failure to provide this documentation will result in enforcement action being taken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will carry out documentary checks and, if required, risk based physical checks at destination.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori?step-by-step-nav=1ddb4c89-1fe9-4ad0-b561-c1b0158e6bc5">EORI number</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to comply with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-declarations-for-goods-brought-into-the-eu?step-by-step-nav=1ddb4c89-1fe9-4ad0-b561-c1b0158e6bc5">customs requirements</a>. Contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc">HMRC</a> for more information.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules from 1 July 2022:</h3>

<p>In addition to the requirements introduced on 1 January, from 1 July 2022 you must ensure that your imports of live fish and shellfish from the EU:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>enter through a UK <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-border-control-posts-animal-and-animal-product-imports">Border Control Post (BCP)</a> that can accept the type of goods, for documentary, identity and physical checks and customs clearance. You may need to pay for this service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> will continue to operate a risk-based programme of import inspection and testing to monitor for serious diseases. The level of physical and identity checks will be based on assessments of biosecurity and public health risks. All high-risk live animals imported from the EU will continue to be checked.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Movements into England and Wales from Northern Ireland and Crown Dependencies</h2>

<p>For movements of live fish and shellfish into GB (England and Wales) from Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man:</p>

The certificate must confirm that the goods meet the animal health requirements for entry into England and Wales.</p>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Problems with documentation</h2>

<h3>Species susceptible to controlled disease</h3>

<p>You may be given a ‘Regulation 23’ notice if there are errors in the documentation for fish or shellfish susceptible to a controlled disease.</p>

<p>If the health risk to other fish is low, the fish or shellfish will be isolated at an <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> approved site while the errors are corrected.</p>

<p>If the errors cannot be corrected, <abbr title="Fish Health Inspectorate">FHI</abbr> may test the consignment for disease. This requires a minimum of 30 animals and the test results can take up to 3 weeks.</p>

<h3>Species not susceptible to controlled disease</h3>

<p>You may be given a ‘Regulation 16’ notice if there are errors in the documentation for fish or shellfish not susceptible to controlled disease. You will need to correct the errors but the fish do not need to be isolated.</p>
