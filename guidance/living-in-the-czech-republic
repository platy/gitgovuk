<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>
<p>You may want to check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/czech-republic/entry-requirements">the entry requirements for the Czech Republic</a>.</p>

<p>You need to secure a Czech <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/temporary-residence.aspx">residence permit</a> before the UK leaves the EU if you want to guarantee your stay in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>You should register your stay with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/hlaseni-pobytu-cizincu.aspx">Czech Foreign Police</a> (in Czech) first. You will need this confirmation of your registration with the Foreign Police when you apply for Czech residency status.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency-and-visas-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency and visas after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal you will need to enter the Czech immigration scheme. To do this, you should <a rel="external" href="https://frs.gov.cz/en/node/455">make an appointment</a> with the Czech immigration scheme.</p>

<p>If you have a certificate of temporary residence, you will need to apply for either a long-term residence permit or a permanent residence permit before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>If you have a permanent residence permit, you will need to change your current documents for a new biometric card by the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can look at <a rel="external" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/brexitmapa4-en-pdf.aspx">this flowchart from the Czech Ministry of Interior</a> which explains the process.</p>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from the Czech Republic</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<p>You can look at our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/czech-republic">travel advice for the Czech Republic</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be new travel rules.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission has said you may not need visas for short stays in the Schengen area or the EU. You may be able to stay for up to 90 days in any EU country, within an 180 day period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You need to make sure you are correctly <a rel="external" href="http://www.mzcr.cz/Cizinci/obsah/health-insurance-companies_2652_23.html">registered for healthcare</a> as a resident in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>If you live in the Czech Republic and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in the Czech Republic, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in the Czech Republic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You should read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-the-czech-republic/">healthcare in the Czech Republic</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the NHS <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/czech-republic-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">find an English-speaking doctor in the Czech Republic</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in the Czech Republic.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in the Czech Republic will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you will still be able to access the Czech healthcare system if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are employed by a Czech employer</li>
  <li>you have a permanent residence permit</li>
  <li>you are self-employed, as long as your circumstances don’t change</li>
</ul>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your S1 form will no longer be recognised by Czech authorities if you do not have a permanent residency permit. You should take action now to decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. UK nationals will be able to return to UK for treatment.</p>

<p>For more information, read the Czech Health Insurance Bureau’s website for <a rel="external" href="https://www.kancelarzp.cz/en/2-uncategorised/586-brexit-en">guidance on access to the Czech healthcare system after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal, however this is reliant on the Czech Republic continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-the-czech-republic">Working in the Czech Republic</h2>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in the Czech Republic, you have the right to work in the Czech Republic. Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">guidance on working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for one of both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records certificate</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.ceskaposta.cz/en/sluzby/egovernment/czechpoint/sluzby-czechpoint">extract from the Czech Criminal Register</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="working-in-the-czech-republic-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in the Czech Republic after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves with a deal, your right to work will not change until the end of implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you may need to apply for a work permit if you are switching jobs and do not hold a permanent residency permit.If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/czech-republic-providing-services-after-eu-exit">our further guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you gained your professional qualification in the UK before the UK leaves the EU it will continue to be recognised by Czech authorities.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>If you work in the Czech Republic, you have the same <a rel="external" href="http://www.czech.cz/en/Business/How-it-works-here/Justice,-legal-environment/Tax-duties-of-foreigners-in-the-Czech-Republic">tax rights and duties</a> as Czech citizens.</p>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with the Czech Republic to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You can read guidance about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">telling HMRC if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

  <li><a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/czech-republic/index_en.htm">paying income tax in the Czech Republic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in the Czech Republic.</p>

<h3 id="declaration-of-overseas-assets">Declaration of overseas assets</h3>

<p>If you are resident in the Czech Republic you must declare all overseas assets, which may include bank accounts, securities, insurance, annuities and property. The declaration is separate to the annual tax return, and there are severe penalties and criminal charges for not doing this.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the EU. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial service in the EU</a>.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in the Czech Republic. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in the Czech Republic, you can claim:</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">‘life certificate’ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible – your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK state pension to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in the Czech Republic, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Czech pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Czech government will take into account periods of work in the UK before EU Exit when calculating your Czech pension.</p>

<p>The UK government will uprate your UK state pension for the fiscal year 2019/2020 in any scenario.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in the Czech Republic. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our guidance on which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">benefits you can claim if you live abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">check which benefits you can claim while you live abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are abroad for more than four weeks, many income-related benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit cannot be paid to you.</p>

<h3 id="czech-benefits">Czech benefits</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to Czech benefits. To find out if you are entitled to Czech benefits and how to claim, you can read the European Union’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/unemployment-and-benefits/index_en.htm">claiming benefits in an EU country</a> like the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time you have worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK Government will continue to pay child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible people in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in the Czech Republic, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Czech contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>
</li>
  <li>keep all records of employment and insurance in the Czech Republic</li>

  <li>look at the guidance by the Czech Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for more information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/35140/2019-03-05_Brexit_zprava_na_web_MPSV.pdf">how to keep access to your benefits</a>
</li>
</ul>
