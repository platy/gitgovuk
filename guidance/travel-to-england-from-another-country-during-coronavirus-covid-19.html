<p>This page tells you what you must do before you travel to England and after you arrive.</p>

<p>What you must do depends on whether you qualify as fully vaccinated under the rules for travel to England.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">different rules if you have been in a red list country or territory</a> in the 10 days before you arrive in England. Red list rules apply whether you are fully vaccinated or not.</p>

<h2>If you are fully vaccinated</h2>

<p>This is what you need to do if you qualify under the fully vaccinated rules for travel to England.</p>

<h3>Before you travel to England – fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>Before you travel to England you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a COVID-19 test – to be taken in the 2 days before you travel to England</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">book and pay for a COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> – to be taken after you arrive in England</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">complete a passenger locator form</a> – to be completed in the 48 hours before you arrive in England</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england" class="govuk-link">Read more about taking a COVID-19 test before you travel to England</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re in England for less than 2 days, you still need to book and pay for a day 2 COVID-19 test. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">You must quarantine</a> until you receive a negative test result, or until you leave England, whichever is sooner.</p>

<h3>When you arrive in England – fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>After you arrive in England you must take a COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. This is the test that you booked before travel.</p>

<p>You can take the test any time after you arrive and before the end of day 2 at the latest. The day you arrive is day 0.</p>

<p>You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england">must quarantine in your home or the place you are staying</a> while you await your test result.</p>

<h4>Test results</h4>

<p>If your test result is negative, you can end your quarantine.</p>

<p>If your test result is positive, you <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do" class="govuk-link">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day of the test is day 0.</p>

<p>If your test result is unclear, you <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>If your test result is unclear, you can choose to take another private test. If the result of that test is negative, you can stop self-isolating.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is delayed, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england">you must quarantine</a> until you receive a negative test result or until day 14 after arrival, whichever is sooner.</p>

<h2>Check if you qualify as fully vaccinated</h2>

<p>To qualify under the fully vaccinated rules for travel to England, you must have proof of full vaccination with a full course of an approved vaccine.</p>

<p>You must have had your final dose of the vaccine at least 14 days before you arrive in England. The day you had your final dose does not count as one of the 14 days.</p>

<p>The proof of vaccination must have been issued by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> vaccination programme</li>
  <li>the United Nations vaccine programme for staff and volunteers</li>
  <li>an overseas vaccination programme with an approved proof of vaccination for travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>Children and other groups that can follow fully vaccinated rules</h3>

<p>Even if you are not fully vaccinated, the fully vaccinated rules apply if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under 18 - see <a href="#travelling-with-children" class="govuk-link">Travelling with children in this guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>taking part in an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> (US residents only for <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> trials), or a phase 2 or 3 vaccine trial that is regulated by the EMA or SRA</li>
  <li>unable to have a COVID-19 vaccination for a medical reason which has been approved by a clinician under the medical exemptions process, and you are resident in England</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proving your vaccination status</h3>

<p>If you are fully vaccinated under the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> vaccination programme, you can prove your vaccination status using either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass">NHS COVID Pass</a> for England and Wales</li>

</ul>

<p>Paper certificates are also available.</p>

<p>There are different ways to prove your vaccination status if you were vaccinated outside of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you qualify under the fully vaccinated rules, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#if-you-are-not-fully-vaccinated">follow the rules for people who are not fully vaccinated</a>.</p>

<h3>Red list countries</h3>

<p>There are different rules if you have been in a red list country in the 10 days before you arrive in England.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">Check which countries and territories are on the red list and read the red list rules</a>.</p>

<h2>If you are not fully vaccinated</h2>

<h3>Before you travel to England – not fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>Before you travel to England you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a COVID-19 test – to be taken in the 2 days before you travel to England</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">book and pay for day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</a> – to be taken after arrival in England</li>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england" class="govuk-link">Read more about taking a COVID-19 test before you travel to England</a>.</p>

<h3>When you arrive in England – not fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>After you arrive in England you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">quarantine at home or in the place you are staying for 10 full days</a></li>
  <li>take your COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests  – you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider">book these tests</a> before you travel</li>
</ul>

<p>You must take the first test on or before day 2 and the second test on or after day 8. The day you arrive is day 0.</p>

<p>If you are in England for less than 10 days, you need to quarantine for the time you are here. You need to book day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. You only need to take the tests if you are still in England on those days.</p>

<h4>If the test result is positive</h4>

<p>If your day 2 test is positive, you <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>You do not need to take the day 8 test if your day 2 test is positive. If your day 2 test is negative, you must take your day 8 test.</p>

<p>If your day 8 test is positive, you <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do" rel="external" class="govuk-link">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the day 8 test is day 0.</p>

<h4>If the test result is negative</h4>

<p>If your day 2 test is negative, you must continue to quarantine.</p>

<p>You must take your day 8 test on or after day 8.</p>

<p>If your day 8 test is negative, you can stop quarantine on whichever is later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 10 – day 0 is the day you arrived in England</li>
  <li>when you receive the day 8 test result</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If you receive your day 8 negative test result back on day 9, you must continue to quarantine until the end of day 10.</p>

<p>If you receive your day 8 negative test result back on day 12, you must quarantine until the end of day 12.</p>

<h4>If the test result is unclear</h4>

<p>If the result of your day 2 test is unclear, you <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>If the result of your day 8 test is negative, you can stop self-isolating on whichever is later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 10 - day 0 is the day you arrived in England</li>
  <li>the day you received the negative day 8 test result</li>
</ul>

<p>If your day 8 test is unclear, you <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do" class="govuk-link" rel="external">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days.  The day you took the day 8 test is day 0.</p>

<p>You can choose to take another private test. If that test result is a negative result, you can stop self-isolating on whichever is later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 10 - day 0 is the day you arrive in England</li>
  <li>the day you received the negative replacement test result from the additional test</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test to Release scheme</h3>

<p>If you need to quarantine, you may be able to end quarantine early if you pay for a private COVID-19 test through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel" class="govuk-link">Test to Release scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>Red list countries</h3>

<p>There are different rules if you have been in a red list country in the 10 days before you arrive in England.</p>

<h2>Travelling with children</h2>

<p>Children aged 4 and under do not have to take any COVID-19 travel tests.</p>

<p>Children aged 12 to 17 must take a COVID-19 test in the 2 days before travel to England.</p>

<p>Children aged 5 to 17 have to follow the testing and quarantine rules for people who qualify as fully vaccinated on arrival in England.</p>

<p>This means that they have to quarantine on arrival and take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on or before day 2.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#if-you-are-fully-vaccinated">Check the rules in this guidance for people who qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England for more details</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">check the rules in the country you are travelling from</a> as they may require children to take a test at the start of your journey to England.</p>

<h2>If you arrived in England before 30 November</h2>

<p>The rules are different if you arrived in England before 4am, 30 November and you qualify as fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>If you did this, you are allowed to take a lateral flow test after arrival in England instead of a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. You only need to self-isolate if the result of your test is positive or ‘unclear’.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This only applies if you arrived before 4am, 30 November. If you arrived after that <a class="govuk-link" href="#if-you-are-fully-vaccinated">you must follow the current rules</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>When you arrive in England – fully vaccinated – arrival before 30 November only</h3>

<p>After you arrive in England you must take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2. The day you arrive is day 0.</p>

<p>This is the lateral flow or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test that you booked before travel.</p>

<p>If the test result is negative, you do not need to self-isolate.</p>

<h4>Lateral flow test – positive result</h4>

<p>If you took a lateral flow test and the result is positive, you must take a free <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test to confirm the result. You must self-isolate until you get the result.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, or inconclusive, you must self-isolate for 10 full days. The day you took the lateral flow test is day 0.</p>

<h4>Lateral flow test – result unclear</h4>

<p>If you took a lateral flow test and the result is unclear, you must self-isolate for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>You can choose to take another private test. If the result is negative, you can stop self-isolating.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test – positive result</h4>

<p>If you took a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and the result is positive, you must self-isolate for 10 full days. The day of the test is day 0.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test – result unclear</h4>

<p>If you took a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and the result is unclear, you must self-isolate for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>You can choose to take another private test. If the result is negative, you can stop self-isolating.</p>
