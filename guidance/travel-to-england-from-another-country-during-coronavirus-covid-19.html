</ul>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">complete a passenger locator form</a> before you travel to England.</p>

<p><a href="#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated" class="govuk-link">Check if you can follow the rules for people who are fully vaccinated</a> â€“ includes people aged 17 and under.</p>

<h3>Not fully vaccinated â€“ from 11 February</h3>

<ul>
  <li>show proof of a negative COVID-19 test â€“ test to be taken in the 2 days before you travel to England</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">book and pay for a COVID-19 PCR test</a> â€“ to be taken after you arrive in England</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">complete a passenger locator form</a> before you travel to England</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to book the PCR test before you travel.</p>

<p>You will not need to quarantine, unless the result of the PCR test is positive.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>If you arrive in England before 4am, 11 February you must follow the current rules, as set out in this guidance below.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>International travel rules until 11 February 2022</h2>

<p>This page tells you what you must do before you travel to England and after you arrive.</p>

<p>What you must do depends on whether you qualify as fully vaccinated under the rules for travel to England.</p>

<p>There are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">different rules if you have been in a red list country or territory</a> in the 10 days before you arrive in England. Red list rules apply whether you are fully vaccinated or not.</p>

<h2>If you are fully vaccinated</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#changes-to-international-travel-rules-from-11-february-2022">These rules apply until 4am 11 February. Read about the rules that will apply if you arrive in England after 4am 11 February</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>This is what you need to do if you qualify under the fully vaccinated rules for travel to England.</p>

<h3>Before you travel to England â€“ fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>Before you travel to England you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">book and pay for a COVID-19 test</a> â€“ to be taken after you arrive in England</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">complete a passenger locator form</a> â€“ to be completed in the 48 hours before you arrive in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to enter the booking reference for your COVID-19 test in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passenger locator form.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re in England for less than 2 days, you still need to book and pay for a COVID-19 test to take after you arrive.</p>

<h3>When you arrive in England â€“ fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>You do not need to quarantine when you arrive in England.</p>

<p>You must take a COVID-19 test. This is the test that you booked before travel. You can book either a lateral flow test or a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>You can take the test any time after you arrive and before the end of day 2 at the latest. The day you arrive is day 0.</p>

<p>If your test result is positive, you must self-isolate.</p>

<p>If your lateral flow test result is positive, you must also take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">Read separate guidance on what you must do if your test result is positive</a>.</p>

<h2>Check if you qualify as fully vaccinated</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">

</div>

<p>To qualify under the fully vaccinated rules for travel to England, you must have proof of full vaccination with a full course of an approved vaccine.</p>

<p>You must have had your final dose of the vaccine at least 14 days before you arrive in England. The day you had your final dose does not count as one of the 14 days.</p>

<p>The proof of vaccination must have been issued by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> vaccination programme</li>
  <li>the United Nations vaccine programme for staff and volunteers</li>
  <li>an overseas vaccination programme with an approved proof of vaccination for travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>

</div>

<h3>Natural immunity</h3>

<p>Proof of natural immunity will not be accepted as an alternative to proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test.</p>

<h3>Children and other groups that can follow fully vaccinated rules</h3>

<p>Even if you are not fully vaccinated, the fully vaccinated rules apply if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under 18 - see <a href="#travelling-with-children" class="govuk-link">Travelling with children in this guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>taking part in an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> (US residents only for <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> trials), or a phase 2 or 3 vaccine trial that is regulated by the EMA or SRA</li>
  <li>unable to have a COVID-19 vaccination for a medical reason which has been approved by a clinician under the medical exemptions process, and you are resident in England</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proving your vaccination status</h3>

<p>If you are fully vaccinated under the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> vaccination programme, you can prove your vaccination status using either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass</a> for England and Wales</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/covid-status"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Scotland COVID Status app</a></li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://covid-19.hscni.net/covidcert-ni-mobile-app">COVIDCert NI</a> in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass letter, which you can request via the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> 119 service or <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-pass" class="govuk-link" rel="external">online via <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>. You cannot use the paper card you receive following your vaccination as proof of vaccination.</p>

<p>There are different ways to prove your vaccination status if you were vaccinated outside of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination">Check what proof is required for the country or territory where you were vaccinated</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you qualify under the fully vaccinated rules, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#if-you-are-not-fully-vaccinated">follow the rules for people who are not fully vaccinated</a>.</p>

<h3>Red list countries</h3>

<p>There are different rules if you have been in a red list country in the 10 days before you arrive in England.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">Check which countries and territories are on the red list and read the red list rules</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england">Read more about taking a COVID-19 test before you travel to England</a>.</p>

<h3>When you arrive in England â€“ not fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>After you arrive in England you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england">quarantine at home or in the place you are staying for 10 full days</a></li>
  <li>take your COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests  â€“ you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">book these tests</a> before you travel</li>
</ul>

<p>You must take the first test on or before day 2 and the second test on or after day 8. The day you arrive is day 0.</p>

<p>If you are in England for less than 10 days, you need to quarantine for the time you are here. You need to book day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. You only need to take the tests if you are still in England on those days.</p>

<h4>If the test result is positive</h4>

<p>If your day 2 test is positive, you <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do" class="govuk-link" rel="external">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>You do not need to take the day 8 test if your day 2 test is positive. If your day 2 test is negative, you must take your day 8 test.</p>

<p>If your day 8 test is positive, you <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do" class="govuk-link">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the day 8 test is day 0.</p>

<h4>If the test result is negative</h4>

<p>If your day 2 test is negative, you must continue to quarantine.</p>

<p>You must take your day 8 test on or after day 8.</p>

<p>If your day 8 test is negative, you can stop quarantine on whichever is later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 10 â€“ day 0 is the day you arrived in England</li>
  <li>when you receive the day 8 test result</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If you receive your day 8 negative test result back on day 9, you must continue to quarantine until the end of day 10.</p>

<p>If you receive your day 8 negative test result back on day 12, you must quarantine until the end of day 12.</p>

<p>If the result of your day 8 test is negative, you can stop self-isolating on whichever is later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 10 - day 0 is the day you arrived in England</li>
  <li>the day you received the negative day 8 test result</li>
