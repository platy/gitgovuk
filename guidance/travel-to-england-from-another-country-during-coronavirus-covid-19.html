<p>This page tells you what you must do before you travel to England and after you arrive.</p>

<p>What you must do depends on whether you qualify as fully vaccinated under the rules for travel to England.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">different rules if you have been in a red list country or territory</a> in the 10 days before you arrive in England. Red list rules apply whether you are fully vaccinated or not.</p>

<h2>If you are fully vaccinated</h2>

<p>This is what you need to do if you qualify under the fully vaccinated rules for travel to England.</p>

<h3>Before you travel to England – fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>Before you travel to England you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider">book and pay for a COVID-19 test</a> – to be taken before the end of day 2 in England</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">complete a passenger locator form</a> – to be completed in the 48 hours before you arrive in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to enter your COVID-19 test booking reference number on your passenger locator form.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>From 22 October you will be able to book an antigen lateral flow device (LFD) test instead of a PCR for your ‘on arrival’ test.</p>
</div>

<h3>When you arrive in England – fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>After you arrive in England you must take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2.</p>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider">book this test</a> before you travel.</p>

<p>If you will be in England for less than 2 days you still need to book and pay for a day 2 COVID-19 test.</p>

<h2>Check if you qualify as fully vaccinated</h2>

<p>Fully vaccinated means that you have had a complete course of an approved vaccine at least 14 days before you arrive in England. The day you had your final dose does not count as one of the 14 days.</p>

<p>The vaccine must be administered under either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> vaccination programme</li>
  <li>an overseas vaccination programme with an approved proof of vaccination for travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination">Check which vaccines are approved and the list of countries and territories with approved proof of vaccination</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Even if you are not fully vaccinated, the fully vaccinated rules apply if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are under 18 and resident in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or one of the countries or territories with approved proof of vaccination</li>
  <li>are taking part in an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> (US residents only for <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> trials)</li>
  <li>cannot have a COVID-19 vaccination for a medical reason which has been approved by a clinician under the new medical exemptions process, and you are resident in England</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proving your vaccination status</h3>

<p>If you are fully vaccinated under the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> vaccination programme, you can prove your vaccination status using either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass">NHS COVID Pass</a> for England and Wales</li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/covid-status" class="govuk-link">NHS Scotland COVID Status app</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://covid-19.hscni.net/covidcert-ni-mobile-app">COVIDCert NI</a> in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>Paper certificates are also available.</p>

<p>There are different ways to prove your vaccination status if you were vaccinated outside of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination">Check what proof is required for the country or territory where you were vaccinated</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you qualify under the fully vaccinated rules, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#if-you-are-not-fully-vaccinated">follow the rules for people who are not fully vaccinated</a>.</p>

<h3>Red list countries</h3>

<p>There are different rules if you have been in a red list country in the 10 days before you arrive in England.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">Check which countries and territories are on the red list and read the red list rules</a>.</p>

<h2>If you are not fully vaccinated</h2>

<p>This is what you need to do if you do not qualify under the fully vaccinated rules for travel to England.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated">Check this section of this guidance to see if you qualify as fully vaccinated</a>.</p>

<h3>Before you travel to England – not fully vaccinated</h3>

  <li>take your pre-booked COVID-19 test on or before day 2 and on or after day 8 – you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">book these tests</a> before you travel</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are in England for less than 10 days, you need to quarantine for the time you are here. You need to book day 2 and day 8 travel tests. You only need to take the tests if you are still in England on those days.</p>
