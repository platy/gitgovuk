<h2>Changes to rules for fully vaccinated travel to England – January 2022</h2>

<h3>From 4am Friday 7 January</h3>

<p>If you qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England, and you will arrive in England after 4am, Friday 7 January, you do not need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a COVID-19 test before you travel to England</li>
  <li>quarantine when you arrive in England</li>
</ul>

<h3>From 4am Sunday 9 January</h3>

<p>If you qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England, and you will arrive in England after 4am, Sunday 9 January, you can choose to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test after you arrive in England.</p>

<p>If you take a lateral flow test and test positive, you will need to self-isolate and take a free confirmatory PCR test.</p>

<p>You must book the test before you travel to England. You can book lateral flow tests from 4am Friday 7 January.</p>

<p>You cannot use a lateral flow test until after 4am, Sunday 9 January. Before 4am Sunday 9 January, you must use a PCR test after arrival.</p>

<p>The fully vaccinated rules also apply to children aged 17 and under, people taking part in an approved vaccine trial, and people who are unable to have a vaccination due to medical reasons.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated" class="govuk-link">who qualifies as fully vaccinated</a>.</p>

<p>If you arrive in England before 4am, 7 January, you must follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#if-you-are-fully-vaccinated" class="govuk-link">current rules for fully vaccinated people</a>.</p>

<p>The rules for people <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#if-you-are-not-fully-vaccinated" class="govuk-link">who do not qualify as fully vaccinated</a> for travel to England will remain the same.</p>
</div>

<p>This page tells you what you must do before you travel to England and after you arrive.</p>

<p>What you must do depends on whether you qualify as fully vaccinated under the rules for travel to England.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">different rules if you have been in a red list country or territory</a> in the 10 days before you arrive in England. Red list rules apply whether you are fully vaccinated or not.</p>

<h2>If you are fully vaccinated</h2>

<p>This is what you need to do if you qualify under the fully vaccinated rules for travel to England.</p>

<h3>Before you travel to England – fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>Before you travel to England you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a COVID-19 test – to be taken in the 2 days before you travel to England</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">book and pay for a COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> – to be taken after you arrive in England</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">complete a passenger locator form</a> – to be completed in the 48 hours before you arrive in England</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england" class="govuk-link">Read more about taking a COVID-19 test before you travel to England</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re in England for less than 2 days, you still need to book and pay for a day 2 COVID-19 test. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england">You must quarantine</a> until you receive a negative test result, or until you leave England, whichever is sooner.</p>

<h3>When you arrive in England – fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>After you arrive in England you must take a COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. This is the test that you booked before travel.</p>

<p>You can take the test any time after you arrive and before the end of day 2 at the latest. The day you arrive is day 0.</p>

<p>You <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">must quarantine in your home or the place you are staying</a> while you await your test result.</p>

<h4>Test results</h4>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is negative, you can end your quarantine.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, you usually have to self-isolate for 10 full days. The day of the test is day 0.</p>

<p>You can stop self-isolating after 7 days if you do a rapid lateral flow test on days 6 and 7 of your self-isolation period and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>both tests are negative</li>
  <li>you did both tests at least 24 hours apart</li>
  <li>you do not have a high temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do a rapid lateral flow test on day 6 and test positive, wait 24 hours before you do the next test.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/how-long-to-self-isolate" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Read the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> guidance for further information on how long to self-isolate for</a>.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is unclear, you <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do" class="govuk-link" rel="external">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is unclear, you can choose to take another private test. If the result of that test is negative, you can stop self-isolating.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is delayed, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england">you must quarantine</a> until you receive a negative test result or until day 14 after arrival, whichever is sooner.</p>

<h2>Check if you qualify as fully vaccinated</h2>

<p>To qualify under the fully vaccinated rules for travel to England, you must have proof of full vaccination with a full course of an approved vaccine.</p>

<p>You must have had your final dose of the vaccine at least 14 days before you arrive in England. The day you had your final dose does not count as one of the 14 days.</p>

<p>The proof of vaccination must have been issued by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> vaccination programme</li>
  <li>the United Nations vaccine programme for staff and volunteers</li>
  <li>an overseas vaccination programme with an approved proof of vaccination for travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination" class="govuk-link">Check which vaccines are approved and the list of countries and territories with approved proof of vaccination</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Children and other groups that can follow fully vaccinated rules</h3>

<p>Even if you are not fully vaccinated, the fully vaccinated rules apply if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under 18 - see <a class="govuk-link" href="#travelling-with-children">Travelling with children in this guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>taking part in an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> (US residents only for <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> trials), or a phase 2 or 3 vaccine trial that is regulated by the EMA or SRA</li>
  <li>unable to have a COVID-19 vaccination for a medical reason which has been approved by a clinician under the medical exemptions process, and you are resident in England</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proving your vaccination status</h3>

<p>If you are fully vaccinated under the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> vaccination programme, you can prove your vaccination status using either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID Pass</a> for England and Wales</li>

</ul>

<p>Paper certificates are also available.</p>

<p>There are different ways to prove your vaccination status if you were vaccinated outside of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you qualify under the fully vaccinated rules, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#if-you-are-not-fully-vaccinated">follow the rules for people who are not fully vaccinated</a>.</p>

<h3>Red list countries</h3>

<p>There are different rules if you have been in a red list country in the 10 days before you arrive in England.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">Check which countries and territories are on the red list and read the red list rules</a>.</p>

<h3>When you arrive in England – not fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>After you arrive in England you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">quarantine at home or in the place you are staying for 10 full days</a></li>
  <li>take your COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests  – you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider">book these tests</a> before you travel</li>
</ul>

<p>You must take the first test on or before day 2 and the second test on or after day 8. The day you arrive is day 0.</p>

<p>If you are in England for less than 10 days, you need to quarantine for the time you are here. You need to book day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. You only need to take the tests if you are still in England on those days.</p>

<h4>If the test result is positive</h4>

<p>If your day 2 test is positive, you <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do" class="govuk-link" rel="external">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>If your day 8 test is positive, you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do" rel="external">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the day 8 test is day 0.</p>

<h4>If the test result is negative</h4>

<p>If your day 2 test is negative, you must continue to quarantine.</p>

<p>You must take your day 8 test on or after day 8.</p>

<p>If your day 8 test is negative, you can stop quarantine on whichever is later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 10 – day 0 is the day you arrived in England</li>
  <li>when you receive the day 8 test result</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If you receive your day 8 negative test result back on day 9, you must continue to quarantine until the end of day 10.</p>

<p>If you receive your day 8 negative test result back on day 12, you must quarantine until the end of day 12.</p>

<h4>If the test result is unclear</h4>

<p>If the result of your day 2 test is unclear, you <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>If the result of your day 8 test is negative, you can stop self-isolating on whichever is later:</p>

  <li>day 10 - day 0 is the day you arrived in England</li>
  <li>the day you received the negative day 8 test result</li>
</ul>

<p>If your day 8 test is unclear, you <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do" class="govuk-link" rel="external">must self-isolate</a> for 10 full days.  The day you took the day 8 test is day 0.</p>

<p>You can choose to take another private test. If that test result is a negative result, you can stop self-isolating on whichever is later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 10 - day 0 is the day you arrive in England</li>
  <li>the day you received the negative replacement test result from the additional test</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#if-you-are-fully-vaccinated" class="govuk-link">Check the rules in this guidance for people who qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England for more details</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">check the rules in the country you are travelling from</a> as they may require children to take a test at the start of your journey to England.</p>
