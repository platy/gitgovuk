<p>Get ready for Brexit on 31 October 2019. This page tells you how to prepare and it will be updated if anything changes, including if a deal is agreed.</p>

<h2 id="no-proof-of-registration-for-holders-of-new-re-registered-designs-and-comparable-trade-marks">No proof of registration for holders of new re-registered designs and comparable trade marks</h2>

<p>Holders of new re-registered designs and comparable trade marks will not receive a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registration certificate.</p>

<p>Details of the new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right will be accessible via our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search-registered-design">Find a registered design</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search-for-trademark">Search for a trade mark</a> services on GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, and also via the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/databases">DesignView platform</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jurisdictional-arrangements-and-pending-proceedings">Jurisdictional arrangements and pending proceedings</h2>
<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> courts can currently act as <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> courts in infringement actions relating to registered Community designs, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade marks, and international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) design and trade mark rights.</p>

<p>Cases are heard under the Community design regulation and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade mark regulation, and the court can issue pan-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> injunctions.</p>

<p>We anticipate that on exit day there will be a small number of cases ongoing before these courts.
member state.</p>

<p>However, it also confirms that actions and remedies taken or granted by the court are applicable to the re-registered design or comparable trade mark only.</p>

<p>We will no longer be under the jurisdiction of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legal system after exit day. As a result, any <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> wide injunctions will not apply to the comparable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> rights.</p>

<p>Proceedings before the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>’s tribunal which are ongoing at exit day will continue to be heard under the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/88/contents">Registered Designs Act</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/26/contents">Trade Marks Act</a>. These will include proceedings in which the holder of an <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> or international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) design or trade mark has brought an action against a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national right.</p>

<p>These proceedings will continue towards resolution on the basis of the law as it stood prior to exit day. If you are a defendant in <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> proceedings based on an <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> or international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) right, or you are the holder of an <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> or international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) right and are involved in proceedings to oppose or cancel a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design or trade mark, these will continue.</p>

<h2 id="existing-injunctions">Existing injunctions</h2>
<p>Court injunctions can prohibit actions which would otherwise give rise to the infringement of an <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr>, an international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) design, or an international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) trade mark.</p>

<p>Where an injunction in place at exit day prohibits actions in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> which would infringe an existing <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> or international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) right, the terms of that injunction will be treated as if they also apply to the re-registered design or comparable trade mark.</p>

<h2 id="licences-security-interests-and-assignments">Licences, security interests and assignments</h2>
<p>On exit day, you may hold a registered Community design (<abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr>), protected international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) design, or protected (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) trade mark which is subject to a licence or security interest, and that licence or security interest may authorise actions in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> which would otherwise infringe the <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> or international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) right.</p>

<p>Subject to any specific conditions it may require, the new law confirms that such a licence or security interest will continue to have legal effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any licence or security interest that refers to an <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> or international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) right and authorises acts in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will therefore be treated as if it applies to the re-registered design or comparable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> trade mark.</p>

<p>It is important that you notify any licensees of the new right. You should check that the creation of the new right does not breach any agreement.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law does not require that transactions are registered per se. However, licences and security interests which are registered at <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> within a period of six months after the date of their being entered into provide certain protections which do not apply to unregistered transactions.</p>

<p>These protections assist people with an interest in the design or trade mark and those seeking full relief for infringement, and they are largely dependent upon proof that an application to register a transaction has been made.</p>

<p>We recognise that applications to register licences and security interests relating to re-registered designs and comparable trade marks cannot be submitted before those rights are created.</p>

<p>Where a licence or security interest is already registered in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and/or international registers before exit day, we will extend the period within which such transactions must be recorded on the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register. The extended period will run to 12 months from exit day.</p>

<p>Where an <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> or international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) right has been the subject of an assignment prior to exit day which has not been recorded in the International Register, the assignor or the assignee will have the right after exit day to apply to record the re-registered design or comparable trade mark in the name of the assignee.</p>

<h2 id="rights-of-representation">Rights of representation</h2>
<p>After Brexit, the current rules relating to rights of representation and address for service will continue.</p>

<p>Many holders of <abbr title="Registered Community Designs">RCDs</abbr> and international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) designs and trade marks will be represented by IP legal professionals based outside of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Businesses, organisations or individuals that have design applications or registrations at the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Intellectual Property Office and have appointed <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> based representatives to act on their behalf, should check the following notices published by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Intellectual Property Office:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notice to holders of and applicants for European Union trade marks and to holders of and applicants for Community designs, and</li>
  <li>Part D of <abbr title="Frequently Asked Question">FAQ</abbr>: ‘Impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union on the European Union trade mark and the Community design’.</li>
</ul>

<p>They may also want to consider speaking to their current representative to find out what arrangements they have in place.</p>

<p>Re-registered designs and comparable trade marks will inherit the representative details that are recorded against the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) rights.</p>

<p>Those representatives will be able to continue acting before the Courts and the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> in any proceeding relating to the equivalent <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right derived from the <abbr title="Registered Community Design">RCD</abbr> or international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) design or trade mark.</p>

<p>At this point in time, the current rules relating to rights of representation and address for service will continue.</p>

<p>Therefore, representatives based in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, Channel Islands or an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> member state will continue to have rights of representation before the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>There will be occasions where <abbr title="European Union Trade Mark">EUTM</abbr> rights holders are based outside the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and have no representation. 
We will not require you to appoint an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> address for service at Brexit. However, if any proceedings are taken on or against the case, we will write to you and ask you to file an address for service in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> before any proceeding can continue.</p>

<h2 id="notifications-about-changes-for-rights-holders-and-how-to-opt-out">Notifications about changes for rights holders and how to opt out</h2>

<p>We will publish a website notice in all languages of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This will confirm that any holder of a registered Community design, international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) design or international (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) trade mark registered or protected prior to exit day will, on and after exit day, also become the holder of a re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design or comparable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> trade mark.</p>

<p>This notice will provide a short summary of information relating to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right, including information on how to opt out.</p>
