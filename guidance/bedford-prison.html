<p>There is disabled access to the visitors centre and the prison. If possible, please let staff know of any additional needs before you arrive.</p>

<h3>Entering Bedford Prison</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID for all visitors.</a>.</p>

<p>When you arrive at Bedford Prison, you will need to check in at the visitors centre. There are strict controls on what you can take into Bedford Prison. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker (you need a £1 coin) or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>Once inside the gate area you will be searched by a member of staff. There will also be a sniffer dog. You will be asked again if you’re carrying any unauthorised articles before you enter the visits hall.</p>

<p>Visitors should dress sensibly. You may be turned away if you are wearing items like vests, low-cut tops, high-cut shorts or dresses, or clothing with offensive slogans.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit and the children’s play area will be closed.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Bedford Prison</h2>
<p>You may not be able to speak with someone at Bedford Prison during their first few days. This is because it can take up to 5 days to approve who they can be in touch with.</p>

<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always need to call you rather than you call them.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>
<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by the public protection team.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Authorised officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Bedford Prison using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Bedford Prison.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>Include the person’s full name and prisoner number (if you have it) on the envelope.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Bedford Prison can buy permitted items from approved online retailers.</p>

<p>For other requests, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Bedford Prison</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>If approved, make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

&nbsp;
