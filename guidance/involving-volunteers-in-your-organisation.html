<p>This guidance is for people who run volunteer-involving organisations or groups, or manage volunteers.

<h2>Ensuring volunteers and their workplaces are safer</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Organisations and groups</h3>

<p>Organisations and groups have a duty of care to volunteers to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety.</p>

<p>Organisations and groups should assess the risks around volunteering roles and activities and take steps to keep volunteers safe. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/steps-needed-to-manage-risk.htm" rel="external">Read the Health and Safety Executive’s guidance on how to assess risks</a>.</p>

<p>Guidance for organisations on COVID-19 and volunteers can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reducing-the-spread-of-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19-in-the-workplace">Reducing the spread of respiratory infections, including COVID-19, in the workplace</a></p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>People who were previously identified as clinically extremely vulnerable</h3>

<p>People who were previously identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) are advised to continue to follow the guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">Coronavirus: how to stay safe and help prevent the spread</a>.</p>

<p>They can also review <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">Guidance for people previously considered clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19</a>, which includes extra precautions they may wish to take.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>People whose immune system means that they are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19</h3>

<p>People whose immune system means that they are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk">COVID-19: guidance for people whose immune system means they are at higher risk</a>.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Individuals should consider advice from their health professional on whether additional precautions are right for them.</p>
</div>

<h2>Travelling to volunteer or while volunteering</h2>

<p>People wishing to travel into another nation in the UK to volunteer need to check the restrictions of that nation before doing so. Read guidance on coronavirus restrictions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" rel="external">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>People who are travelling internationally to volunteer should check:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/travel-abroad">guidance on international travel</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">if the country you’re going to is accepting travellers and / or volunteers</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">if your volunteering role is exempt from current travel restrictions</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">the rules you must follow when you return to England</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Vaccination as a condition of deployment in health and social care settings</h2>

<p>Since 15 March, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/revoking-vaccination-as-a-condition-of-deployment-across-all-health-and-social-care/outcome/revoking-vaccination-as-a-condition-of-deployment-across-all-health-and-social-care-consultation-response#government-response-to-the-issues-raised">the government has revoked the requirements</a> that CQC-registered persons only permit those who are vaccinated against COVID-19, unless otherwise exempt, to be deployed for the provision of a CQC-regulated activity in health and/or social care, and to enter CQC registered care home premises.</p>

<h2>Safeguarding volunteers</h2>
<p>Your organisation or group should think carefully about how it safeguards its volunteers and everyone who comes into contact with them. Volunteers should be recognised throughout your organisation or group’s safeguarding policies. Safeguarding should also be considered throughout your policies relating to volunteers.</p>

<p>Read information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service">Disclosure and Barring Service</a>, including guidance on eligibility and how to apply.</p>
