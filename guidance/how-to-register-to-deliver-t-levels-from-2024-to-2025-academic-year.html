<p>If you are looking for information about how to register to deliver T Levels from September 2023, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-register-to-deliver-t-levels-in-2023-to-2024-academic-year">how to register to deliver T Levels from 2023 to 2024</a> academic year page.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Guidance for providers who are delivering 16 to 19 study programmes. It outlines how to register an intention to commence delivery of T Levels in 2024 to 2025 academic year and to indicate an interest in delivering a T Level Transition Programme.</p>

<p>The purpose of this guidance is to set out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how providers can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/service/2024-TLevel-Registration" rel="external">register an intention to commence delivery of  T Levels in 2024 to 2025 academic year</a>
</li>
  <li>the registration deadlines of:
    <ul>
      <li>29 July 2022 to access implementation planning support and to be eligible for T Level Capital Funding</li>
      <li>24 March 2023 to receive up-front delivery funding in 2024 (and to ensure you are included in the data collections that link to funding allocations)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the T Levels that will be available for delivery</li>
  <li>what is required from providers wanting to deliver T Levels from 2024 to 2025 academic year</li>
  <li>the support available to providers after they have registered</li>
  <li>that the current T Level approved providers (selected to deliver for the first time in 2020, 2021, 2022, or 2023) do not need to submit a registration form to extend their T Level delivery for 2024 to 2025 academic year. Their delivery intentions will be collected through the bi-annual T Level Data Collection</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1042614/2021_T_Level_Action_Plan_Formatted_Clean_Version_15_Dec.pdf" rel="external">T Level Action Plan</a> 2021 provides information for providers interested in delivering T Levels from 2024. It provides an update on the progress with T Levels so far and the next stage of work. It also provides information on the T Level Transition Programme. Providers will be able to indicate their interest in delivering this as part of their T Level 2024 registration. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-transition-programme-framework-for-delivery-2022-to-2023">T Level Transition Programme framework</a> for delivery is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>2024 will be the fifth year of T Level rollout and this is the point at which we are completing the process of broadening access to T Levels, so that it becomes part of the mainstream offer for all students aged 16, 17 and 18. All providers currently funded to deliver 16 to 19 study programmes will be eligible to deliver all of the available T Levels from September 2024.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Providers may submit their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/service/2024-TLevel-Registration" rel="external">registration form</a> from now and up to the closing date, which is midnight on 24 March 2023. This is the final date to register for delivery and be eligible to receive an up-front funding allocation for T Level delivery for 2024 to 2025 academic year. We do however encourage providers to register as early as possible so that they can take advantage of the support that will be offered to providers.</p>

<p>Providers submitting their registration form by midnight on 29 July 2022 will be able to access the following support, to assist them with their T Level 2024 to 2025 academic year delivery preparations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support for implementation planning so that you are ready to deliver T Levels</li>
  <li>support for the development of T Level Transition Programmes</li>
  <li>conversations with the T Level support team</li>
  <li>regular updates on the latest T Level news</li>
  <li>guidance on capital funding and signposting to when this is available</li>
  <li>access to up-front funding for additional T Level delivery hours and industry placements</li>
  <li>access to guidance, resources and networks of other providers delivering T Levels and preparing to deliver T Levels</li>
  <li>access to the full range of support material on the Support with delivering T Levels website</li>
  <li>access to the full range of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/supporting/professional-development/technical-education/t-levels/#:~:text=The%20T%20Level%20Professional%20Development%20(TLPD)%20offer%20supports,through%20the%20doors%20of%20a%20classroom%20or%20workshop." rel="external">T Level Professional Development Programme resources and support</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-are-funded">how T Levels are funded</a> and the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providers-selected-to-deliver-t-levels">T Level providers</a> (those delivering T Levels and T Level Transition Programmes) is available on GOV.UK.</p>
</div>

<h2>Current T Level approved providers</h2>

<p>Current T Level approved providers (selected to deliver in 2020, 2021, 2022, or 2023) do not need to submit a registration form to extend their T Level delivery for 2024 to 2025 academic year. These providers will be able to deliver any of the T Levels available from September 2024, subject to meeting the awarding body centre approval requirements and will be able to confirm their delivery intentions to us through established T Level data collection channels.</p>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Providers registering their intentions any time up to 24 March 2023 will receive an acknowledgement and a reference number shortly after submitting their application, confirming that it has been received.</p>

<p>Registrations will be processed at the end of the month in which they were submitted, and we will contact providers during the following month to confirm their T Level delivery and share information. Registrations where a provider has converted to an academy or has merged/plans to merge may take slightly longer to process.</p>

<p>Providers who complete their registration to deliver T Levels by 29 July 2022 will be linked to our support team, will have access to a range of resources and events, and will receive regular information and updates.</p>

<p>Those registering to deliver T Levels between August 2022 and 24 March 2023 will not be able to access the same level of support. They will receive all T Level updates and will be able to access information and work with others through our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">support with delivering T Levels</a> web pages.</p>

<p>All providers registering up to 24 March 2023 will be asked to complete the bi-annual T Level data collections in 2023 and may have a conversation with the ESFA team about their planned student numbers where we feel that assumptions are not realistic and deliverable. The October 2023 data collection will confirm planned T Level student numbers for 2024 to 2025 academic year to enable a T Level funding allocation to be made in March 2024 as part of main 16 to 19 funding allocations.</p>

<h2>T Levels available for delivery from 2024 to 2025 academic year</h2>

<p>There are 23 T Levels, across 11 T Level routes that will be available for delivery in 2024 to 2025 academic year. These are set out in the T Level routes spreadsheet below, along with their associated occupational specialisms.</p>

<p>There will be one or more occupational specialisms available as part of each T Level, which are the specific areas of study that providers and students might focus on after they have completed core learning, each leading students to defined occupational areas. Further information on the content of the T Levels can be found in the links in the spreadsheet below. Where T Levels have already been developed and are available, the links are for the actual technical qualifications. For those T Levels that are still in development, the final outline content, from which the qualifications will be developed is available in the spreadsheet below. The occupational specialism names and content may be subject to change during the development stage.</p>

<h2>Registering your intention to deliver T Levels for 2024 to 2025 academic year</h2>

<p>ESFA funded providers who hold a current 16 to 19 study programme funding agreement or contract, can access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/service/2024-TLevel-Registration" rel="external">registration form</a> through their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE sign-in</a> account. Providers who have a contract to deliver apprenticeships or adult provision only, are not eligible to apply.</p>

<p>If providers are not registered with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE sign-in</a> they should complete this step first, and once registered, should add 2024 registration form to their account.</p>

<p>Providers will be required to enter a valid UKPRN as part of their application. This will be used to partially populate the registration form and to validate whether applicants hold an active Education and Skills Funding Agreement, or contract, and receive funding to deliver 16 to 19 study programmes.</p>

<p>Providers wishing to access the full range of support available for implementation planning must submit their registration form by midnight on 29 July 2022.</p>

<p>Providers must submit their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/service/2024-TLevel-Registration" rel="external">registration form</a> by midnight on 24 March 2023 to secure up-front delivery funding for their T Level 2024 to 2025 academic delivery. After this date, it will not be possible for providers to be supported or funded up-front to deliver T Levels in 2024 to 2025 academic year. Instead, any unregistered T Level delivery will be funded through the in-year growth process applicable in 2024 to 2025 (subject to affordability), so long as this is correctly coded on the ILR or school census. T Level Transition Programme starts are not funded up-front. Instead, these students will be counted within the usual full-time lagged student numbers for study programmes. Further information is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-are-funded">how T Levels are funded</a> page on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>After providers have submitted the registration form, they will receive a notification confirming that it has been submitted. If for any reason this email confirmation is not received or there are any technical issues when registering, providers should contact us by completing an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">enquiry form</a>, selecting the â€˜T Levelsâ€™ option and include within the query box â€˜T Levels 2024â€™, with provider name and UKPRN as a reference.</p>

<p>We will write to the Head of Organisation detailed on our Provider Customer Relationship Management system to confirm the T Level(s) a provider has registered to deliver, and the T Level Transition Programmes they have indicated an interest in delivering.</p>

<h2>How to complete the registration process</h2>

<p>Completing the registration form</p>

<p>Providers wishing to register can access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/service/2024-TLevel-Registration" rel="external">registration form</a> through their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE sign-in</a> account.</p>

<p>We will ask for the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any structural changes, or whether providers have converted to academy status</li>
  <li>the T Levels a provider plans to deliver in the 2024 to 2025 academic year, and planned student numbers
    <ul>
      <li>this is an initial indication, and we recognise that plans may develop as providers work through their planning and prepare for delivery in 2024</li>
