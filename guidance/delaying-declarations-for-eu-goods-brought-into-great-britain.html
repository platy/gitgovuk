<p>For goods brought into Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), you (or someone who deals with customs for you) may be able to delay sending HMRC the full information about your goods by up to 175 days after import.</p>

<p>However, you cannot delay declarations and must follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-declarations-for-goods-brought-into-the-eu" class="govuk-link">normal rules for making an import declaration</a> if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your goods are brought in from countries outside of the EU</li>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-goods-imported-into-great-britain-from-the-eu-that-are-controlled" class="govuk-link">goods are controlled</a>
</li>
  <li>HMRC has told you to, because you have a poor compliance record</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If your business is not <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-youre-established-in-the-uk-or-eu-for-customs#what-established-means" class="govuk-link">established in the UK</a>, you must get someone established in the UK to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appoint-someone-to-deal-with-customs-on-your-behalf">act indirectly on your behalf for customs</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>When you can delay declarations</h2>

<p>You can delay declarations if your goods are not controlled, are moving from EU free circulation and HMRC has not told you that you cannot delay declarations, and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you brought goods from EU free circulation into free circulation in Great Britain, between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021</li>
  <li>you bring goods from free circulation in Ireland (including goods that started their movement in Northern Ireland) into free circulation in Great Britain, from 1 January 2022</li>
  <li>you bring goods that <a rel="external" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-to-declare-goods-you-bring-into-or-take-out-of-the-UK/start" class="govuk-link">need to be declared</a> from Northern Ireland (including goods that started their movement in Ireland) into free circulation in Great Britain, from 1 January 2022</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goods moved from the EU, or goods moving from Ireland, into free circulation</h3>

<p>You must have moved EU free circulation goods into free circulation in Great Britain between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021, or will be moving goods from Ireland free circulation (including goods that started their movement in Northern Ireland) into free circulation in Great Britain from 1 January 2022 (declared and customs duties paid). This can be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>directly from import</li>
  <li>from a customs special procedure in Great Britain (for example customs warehousing)</li>
  <li>from a temporary storage facility in Great Britain</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bring-goods-into-or-through-the-uk-using-union-and-common-transit" class="govuk-link">using transit</a> – if the movement of the goods started in the EU and ended in Great Britain</li>
