<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU and provides for a deal on citizensâ€™ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the EU broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Denmark at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Denmark.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information.</p>

<p>In the meantime, make sure you are registered as a resident in Denmark. We will update this guidance as soon as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Denmark before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Residence-as-a-Nordic-citizen-or-EU-or-EEA-citizen" class="govuk-link">register as a Danish resident</a> if you want to stay in Denmark after 2020.</p>

<p>Once you have an EU residence document (EU-opholdsdokument), you must <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/Coming-to-Denmark/CPR-Bank-NemID/CPR---Registration-in-Denmark" class="govuk-link">register with your local civil registration office</a> (Folkeregistret). When you register you will get a central person register (CPR) number.</p>

<p>If you need a replacement EU residence document, you can contact the Danish Agency for International Recruitment and Integration to request a replacement.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency rules or registration processes we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on it.</p>

<p>We will update these pages with details of any changes to the rules as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-denmark" class="govuk-link">sign up for updates</a> to this guidance.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-denmark">Driving in Denmark</h2>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are a UK licence holder living in Denmark, you should <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/Coming-to-Denmark/Foreign-driving-licences" class="govuk-link">exchange your UK licence for a Danish one</a>. You can still use your Danish licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>If you are in Denmark and your UK driving licence is lost, stolen or expires you will not be able to renew it with the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You will need to apply to the DVLA for a â€˜certificate of entitlementâ€™ in Danish to be able to apply for a Danish driving licence.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Denmark, read the guidance on:</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>Read the Danish Customs and Tax Administrationâ€™s guidance on car registration rules and taxes in Denmark.</p>

<p>You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are living in Denmark or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, youâ€™ll have life-long healthcare rights in Denmark as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<p>If you are legally resident in Denmark, you will be entitled to treatment on the same basis as Danish insured citizens.</p>

<p>When you register with your local civil registration office (Folkeregistret) you will receive a <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/Coming-to-Denmark/Healthcare" class="govuk-link">national health insurance card</a> (Sygesikringsbevis), which gives you access to free medical treatment.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-denmark" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare for UK nationals living in Denmark</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Denmark, you must not use your EHIC from the UK to access healthcare in Denmark.</p>

<p>When you travel from Denmark for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/safety-and-security" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>If you are registered for public healthcare as a resident, you will be able to use your Danish issued EHIC when you travel outside of Denmark until the end of the transition period.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>finding <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/denmark-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners" class="govuk-link">English-speaking doctors</a> in Denmark</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="working-in-denmark">Working in Denmark</h2>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in Denmark, you have the right to work in Denmark. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in an EU country</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/" class="govuk-link">Life in Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have registered residence in Denmark and have a CPR number, you should <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&lang=us&ik_navn=breadcrum" class="govuk-link">apply for an income tax card</a> (Skattekort). Your employer will need this card.</p>

<p>If you are registered as resident in Denmark on or before 31 December 2020 your right to work will stay the same, as long as you remain a resident in Denmark.</p>

<h2 id="education-and-professional-qualifications">Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>If you are resident in Denmark on or before 31 December 2020, you will continue to access higher education on the same terms as you do now. This means you will only pay tuition fees for education in Denmark where EU and EEA citizens also pay tuition fees. You will also continue to have access to Danish student grants.</p>

<p>Read guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-students-in-the-eu-continuing-your-studies" class="govuk-link">continuing your studies in the European Union</a>.</p>

<h3 id="professional-qualifications">Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>If you have already been recognised by an EU country as holding valid professional qualifications, this will remain valid after 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you have not had your professional qualifications recognised, you can submit an application under the current rules until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Read the Danish government <a rel="external" href="https://ufm.dk/en/education/recognition-and-transparency/regulated-professions/applications-under-eu-rules" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get your professional qualifications recognised</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>Denmark and the UK have a double taxation agreement to prevent income being taxed in both countries.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Denmark have not changed. You should send your questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>Once you have registered as a resident in Denmark and have a CPR number, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&lang=us&ik_navn=breadcrum" class="govuk-link">apply for an income tax card</a> - Skattekort. Your employer will need this card.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea" class="govuk-link">telling HMRC if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.workindenmark.dk/Working-in-DK/Tax" class="govuk-link">paying income tax in Denmark</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Denmark.  Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/denmark-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">English-speaking lawyer</a> in Denmark.</p>

<h3 id="declaration-of-overseas-assets">Declaration of overseas assets</h3>

<p>When you move to Denmark, you have a duty <a rel="external" href="https://skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=2244287" class="govuk-link">to inform the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen)</a> of any assets or savings you have abroad.</p>

<p>You will not be taxed on any savings or assets that you bring with you from abroad when moving to Denmark, but you may be taxed on interest income and any dividends.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> so that you protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU or EEA and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Denmark, you can claim:</p>

<p>There will be no changes before 31 December 2020 to the rules on claiming the UK State Pension in the EU, EEA or Switzerland as a result of the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<p>You can continue to receive your UK State Pension if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland and you can still claim your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020 you will get your UK State Pension uprated every year for as long as you continue to live there. This will happen even if you start claiming your pension on or after 1 January 2021, as long as you meet the qualifying conditions explained in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">new State Pension guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you are living in Denmark by 31 December 2020, you will be able to count future social security contributions towards meeting the qualifying conditions for your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Denmark, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Danish pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/benefits-and-pensions-for-uk-nationals-in-the-eea-or-switzerland" class="govuk-link">guidance on benefits and pensions in the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are moving or retiring abroad.</p>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Denmark. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our guidance on which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad" class="govuk-link">benefits you can claim if you live abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad" class="govuk-link">check which benefits you can claim while youâ€™re abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals" class="govuk-link">request proof of the time youâ€™ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<p>There will be no changes before 31 December 2020 to the rules on claiming UK benefits in the EU, EEA or Switzerland as a result of the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020, you will continue to receive any UK benefits you already receive. This will continue for as long as you live there and meet all other eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Denmark, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Danish contribution-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contribution-based benefits after 31 December 2020.</p>
