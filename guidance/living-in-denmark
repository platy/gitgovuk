When you register you will get a central person register (CPR) number.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Denmark</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (such as train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are legally resident in Denmark, you will be entitled to treatment on the same basis as Danish insured citizens.</p>

<p>When you register at Folkeregistret (civil registration office) you will receive a <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/Coming-to-Denmark/Healthcare">national health insurance card</a> (Sygesikringsbevis), which gives you access to free medical treatment.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Denmark, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Denmark.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you  can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/safety-and-security">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For an assessment of your Danish EHICâ€™s validity, contact <a rel="external" href="https://www.atp.dk/en/atp-as-an-administrator/udbetaling-danmark-internationally/international-health-insurance">Udbetaling Danmark</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">Check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Denmark.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Denmark will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Denmark. If you are registered for public healthcare as a resident, you will be able to use your EHIC when you travel outside of Denmark until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, UK nationals lawfully residing in Denmark before the day the UK leaves the EU will be entitled to the same healthcare benefits as today. UK nationals who <a rel="external" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB">obtain legal residency</a> after Brexit will also be entitled to public healthcare in Denmark.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid if thereâ€™s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme if thereâ€™s no deal, however this is reliant on Denmark continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>More information about your right to health services if the UK leaves the EU without a deal is available from the <a rel="external" href="https://stps.dk/en/citizens/international-health-insurance/no-deal-brexit-your-right-to-healthcare-services-/">Danish Patient Safety Authority</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-denmark">Working in Denmark</h2>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in Denmark, you have the right to work in Denmark. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/">Life in Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have registered residence in Denmark and have a CPR number, you should <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&lang=us&ik_navn=breadcrum">apply for an income tax card</a> (Skattekort). Your employer will need this card.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/denmark-providing-services-after-eu-exit">Read the guidance on providing services</a> if youâ€™re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after Brexit.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-denmark-after-brexit">Working in Denmark after Brexit</h2>

<p>If there is a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal and you are registered as a resident in Denmark before Brexit, you will have the right to work in Denmark.</p>

<p>If you were legally resident in another EU Member State and working across the Danish border before Brexit, your right to work in Denmark will continue.</p>

<p>If you want to work in Denmark after Brexit, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&lang=us&ik_navn=breadcrum">apply for a work permit.</a></p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>Denmark and the UK have a double-taxation agreement to prevent income being taxed in both countries.</p>

<p>Once you have registered as a resident in Denmark and have a CPR number, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&lang=us&ik_navn=breadcrum">apply for an income tax card</a> - Skattekort. Your employer will need this card.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Denmark.  Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/denmark-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer</a> in Denmark.</p>

<h3 id="declaration-of-overseas-assets">Declaration of overseas assets</h3>

<p>When you move to Denmark, you have a duty <a rel="external" href="https://skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=2244287">to inform the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen)</a> of any assets or savings you have abroad.</p>

<p>You will not be taxed on any savings or assets that you bring with you from abroad when moving to Denmark, but you may be taxed on interest income and any dividends.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> so that you protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-brexit">Money and tax after Brexit</h3>

<p>Brexit will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Denmark. You should send your questions about double taxation as a taxpayer to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, it may become more expensive to use your bank card in Denmark. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial services if thereâ€™s no Brexit deal</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Denmark, you can claim:</p>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">â€˜life certificateâ€™ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you donâ€™t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-brexit">Pensions after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay a state pension to those eligible in the EU after Brexit and will uprate your UK state pension for the fiscal year 2019/2020 in all Brexit scenarios.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions if the UK leaves without a deal</a>.</p>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Denmark, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Danish pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Denmark. You should:</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit cannot be paid to you if youâ€™re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time youâ€™ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="danish-benefits">Danish benefits</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to Danish benefits. To find out if you are entitled to Danish benefits and how to claim, you can read the EUÂ´s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1107&langId=en">Danish social security benefits</a>. Your local municipality (Kommune) will be able to help you with any questions about Danish benefits.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-brexit">Benefits after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay child and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals after Brexit.</p>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Denmark, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Danish contribution-based benefits.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal and you were registered as a resident in Denmark before the day before Brexit you will have the right to contribution-based benefits. If you arrive after Brexit, you will not be entitled to contribution-based benefits until you have got a residence and work permit.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-denmark">Driving in Denmark</h2>

<p>If you are a UK licence holder living in Denmark, you should <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/Coming-to-Denmark/Foreign-driving-licences">exchange your UK licence for a Danish one</a> before the UK leaves the EU. If thereâ€™s no deal on 31 October 2019 and you have not applied to exchange your UK license for a Danish one beforehand, you will have to pass a controlling driving test to be able to carry on driving in Denmark. You can still use your Danish licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>If you have an old UK licence that does not have a 10 year validity period, you must renew or exchange it for a Danish licence once youâ€™ve been resident in Denmark for 2 years.</p>

<p>If you are in Denmark and your UK driving licence is lost, stolen or expires you will not be able to renew it with the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You will need to apply to the DVLA for a â€˜certificate of entitlementâ€™ in Danish to be able to apply for a Danish driving licence.</p>

<p>Driving after Brexit If there is a deal, driving licence rules will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>
