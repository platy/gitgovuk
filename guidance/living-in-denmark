<p>See also <a rel="external" href="https://familieretshuset.dk/en/your-life-situation/your-life-situation/custody-and-residence">custody and residence of children in Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>You must <a rel="external" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Residence-as-a-Nordic-citizen-or-EU-or-EEA-citizen">register as a Danish resident</a> if you want to stay in Denmark for more than 3 months or more than 6 months if you are looking for a job.</p>

<p>Once you have an EU residence document (EU-opholdsdokument), you must <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/Coming-to-Denmark/CPR-Bank-NemID/CPR---Registration-in-Denmark">register with your local civil registration office</a> (Folkeregistret). When you register you will get a central person register (CPR) number.</p>

<p>For more information you can read the <a rel="external" href="http://uim.dk/brexit/brexit-how-does-it-affect-you-as-a-british-citizen-living-in-denmark/if-the-withdrawal-agreement-is-not-approved/q-a-regarding-no-deal-scenario">Danish government’s guidance</a> for UK nationals in Denmark.</p>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-denmark">sign up for our email updates</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Denmark</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU Member State, you will be able to transit through other EU Member States to reach your country of residence. If you do not yet hold a residence permit from your Member State of residence, please check the entry requirements for your location before travelling. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are legally resident in Denmark, you will be entitled to treatment on the same basis as Danish insured citizens.</p>

<p>When you register at Folkeregistret (civil registration office) you will receive a <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/Coming-to-Denmark/Healthcare">national health insurance card</a> (Sygesikringsbevis), which gives you access to free medical treatment.</p>

<p>If you live in Denmark and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Denmark, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Denmark.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/safety-and-security">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For an assessment of your Danish EHIC’s validity, please contact <a rel="external" href="https://www.atp.dk/en/atp-as-an-administrator/udbetaling-danmark-internationally/international-health-insurance">Udbetaling Danmark</a>.</p>

<p>You can read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-denmark-the-faroe-islands-and-greenland/">the NHS guidance on healthcare in Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>You can read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">the NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/denmark-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">English-speaking doctors</a> in Denmark.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Denmark.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Denmark will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Denmark. If you are registered for public healthcare as a resident, you will be able to use your EHIC when you travel outside of Denmark until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, UK nationals lawfully residing in Denmark before the day the UK leaves the EU will be entitled to the same healthcare benefits as today. UK nationals who <a rel="external" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB">obtain residency</a> after the date the UK leaves the EU will also be entitled to public healthcare in Denmark.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and there is no arrangement with Denmark to continue reciprocal healthcare, pensioners receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal, however this is reliant on Denmark continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>More information about your right to health services if the UK leaves the EU without a deal is available from the <a rel="external" href="https://stps.dk/en/citizens/international-health-insurance/no-deal-brexit-your-right-to-healthcare-services-/">Danish Patient Safety Authority</a>.</p>

<p>You should read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-denmark-the-faroe-islands-and-greenland/">NHS guidance on healthcare for UK nationals living in Denmark and how it may change after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-denmark">Working in Denmark</h2>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in Denmark, you have the right to work in Denmark. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/">Life in Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have registered residence in Denmark and have a CPR number, you should <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&lang=us&ik_navn=breadcrum">apply for an income tax card</a> (Skattekort). Your employer will need this card.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/denmark-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-denmark-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Denmark after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal and you are registered as a resident in Denmark before the UK leaves the EU, you will have the right to work in Denmark.</p>

<p>If you were legally resident in another EU Member State and working across the Danish border before the UK leaves the EU, your right to work in Denmark will continue. If you want to work in Denmark after the UK leaves the EU, you should <a rel="external" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Work">apply for a work permit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>Denmark and the UK have a double-taxation agreement to prevent income being taxed in both countries.</p>

<p>Once you have registered as a resident in Denmark and have a CPR number, you should <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&lang=us&ik_navn=breadcrum">apply for an income tax card</a> - Skattekort. Your employer will need this card.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.workindenmark.dk/Working-in-DK/Tax">paying income tax in Denmark</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Denmark.  Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/denmark-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer</a> in Denmark.</p>

<h3 id="declaration-of-overseas-assets">Declaration of overseas assets</h3>

<p>When you move to Denmark, you have a duty <a rel="external" href="https://skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=2244287">to inform the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen)</a> of any assets or savings you have abroad.</p>

<p>You will not be taxed on any savings or assets that you bring with you from abroad when moving to Denmark, but you may be taxed on interest income and any dividends.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> so that you protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your bank card in Denmark. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial services if there’s no EU Exit deal</a>.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Denmark. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Denmark, you can claim:</p>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">‘life certificate’ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK State Pension to eligible UK nationals after the UK leaves the EU. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you should read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Denmark, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Danish pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>The UK government will uprate your UK state pension for the fiscal year 2019/2020 in any scenario.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Denmark. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our guidance on which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">benefits you can claim if you live abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">check which benefits you can claim while you’re abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit cannot be paid to you.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time you’ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="danish-benefits">Danish benefits</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to Danish benefits. To find out if you are entitled to Danish benefits and how to claim, you can read the EU´s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1107&langId=en">Danish social security benefits</a>. Your local municipality (Kommune) will be able to help you with any questions about Danish benefits.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay child and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Denmark, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Danish contribution-based benefits.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves without a deal and you were registered as a resident in Denmark before the day the UK leaves the EU, you will have the right to contribution-based benefits. If you arrive after the UK leaves the EU, you will not be entitled to contribution-based benefits until you have got a residence and work permit.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-denmark">Driving in Denmark</h2>

<p>If you are a UK licence holder living in Denmark, you should <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/Coming-to-Denmark/Foreign-driving-licences">exchange your UK licence for a Danish one</a> before the UK leaves the EU. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 31 October 2019, you will have to pass a controlling driving test to be able to carry on driving in Denmark. You can still use your Danish licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>If you have an old UK licence that does not have a 10 year validity period, you must renew or exchange it for a Danish licence once you’ve been resident in Denmark for 2 years.</p>

<p>If you are in Denmark and your UK driving licence is lost, stolen or expires you will not be able to renew it with the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You will need to apply to the DVLA for a ‘certificate of entitlement’ in Danish to be able to apply for a Danish driving licence.</p>
