<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Creative Industries is one of the fastest growing sectors of the UK economy, providing significant employment opportunities and economic benefits. The Create Growth Programme will capitalise on this growth opportunity and support innovative creative businesses in six regions in England outside London to reach their high-growth potential. The programme is expected to provide each region with a package of support to address unique market and information failures that prevent creative businesses from accessing finance and scaling in regions outside London.</p>

<p>The expected aims of the programme are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<b>Support high-growth potential creative businesses to become investment ready</b> outside of London, by developing businesses’ knowledge, skills and access to finance.</li>
  <li>
<b>Increase the number of investors willing to invest in creative businesses</b> outside of London, by educating and developing investor networks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Create Growth Programme will build on DCMS’s Creative Scale Up pilot, developed as part of the Creative Industries Sector Deal, which funded the Greater Manchester, West of England and West Midlands Combined Authorities in supporting creative businesses to become investment ready.</p>

<h2>Delivery model</h2>

<p>The Create Growth Programme is expected to provide regions with a package of support across three complementary strands: business support; finance; and investor capacity building.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that a national provider will be appointed to deliver finance to creative businesses and investor capacity building activities across the six participating regions.</p>

<p>Business support will be delivered directly by the participating regions, and will help to build local knowledge, capacity and infrastructure to support creative businesses beyond the programme.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>The Create Growth Programme will be open to any area across England outside of London. Applications will be accepted from local partnerships, which must include either a Combined Authority, a consortium of Local Authorities or a Local Enterprise Partnership. One organisation must act as the lead organisation and submit the application.</p>

<p>Applicants will be expected to demonstrate a commitment to supporting the growth of creative businesses in the area and the need for investment in business support programmes and increased investor networks to accelerate and maximise impact.</p>

<p>Applicants will also be expected to demonstrate a sufficient number of creative businesses within their area at the right growth stage to benefit from intensive business support and access to private investors.</p>

<h2>Application process and key dates</h2>

<p>There will be a two stage process for applying to the Create Growth Programme, involving an Expression of Interest (EOI) stage to shortlist applicants and a full application stage.</p>

<p>The EOI stage is expected to launch in <b>May 2022</b> and will be open for four weeks. More detailed guidance on applications will be available at this point.</p>

<p>Shortlisted applicants will be invited to submit full applications. Applications for this stage are expected to open in <b>June 2022</b> with a four week window for submitting full applications.</p>

<p>Applicants should expect to be notified of the decision outcome in <b>Summer 2022</b>. The programme is expected to launch in <b>Autumn 2022</b>.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>Assessment is expected to focus on five criteria, which regions will be required to provide evidence against in their applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<b>Characteristics of place: local creative businesses and infrastructure</b> - Regions should demonstrate that they have a large enough cluster (or group of clusters) of creative businesses with suitable growth prospects to enable meaningful engagement with and impact from the programme. Regions should also demonstrate that there is sufficient local infrastructure to support businesses beyond the programme (eg. growth hubs, innovation accelerators, regional funds).</li>
  <li>
<b>Programme need</b> - Regions should demonstrate that there is unmet demand for the programme and that it will build on and not duplicate existing activity in the region.</li>
  <li>
<b>Local organisational capacity</b> - Regions should demonstrate that they have the capacity, skills and resources to deliver the programme, as well as sufficient understanding of and partnerships with creative businesses and networks in their region.</li>
  <li>
<b>Programme legacy</b> - Regions should demonstrate how the programme will support them in developing partnerships and building long-term capacity and legacy infrastructure to support the creative industries in their area after the programme ends. We encourage regions to identify opportunities for additional funding to support the continuation of the programme beyond its lifecycle or complementary feeder and follow-on programmes.</li>
  <li>
<b>Equality, diversity and inclusion</b> - Regions should demonstrate their commitment to opening up access and broadening the diversity of workforce in creative businesses in their area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once applications have been assessed and moderated, DCMS will make awards to regions. A portfolio approach will be used to ensure that the decision outcome meets the following additional considerations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<b>Geographic spread</b> - DCMS will look to ensure a fair spread of successful regions across England.</li>
  <li>
<b>Creative sub-sectors</b> - Different regions may have particular strengths in specific creative sub-sectors (eg. film, video games, fashion and publishing). DCMS will look to ensure that the portfolio of regions in the CGP supports businesses across a range of creative sub-sectors.</li>
  <li>
<b>Growth potential</b> - DCMS will look to support regions that are identified as having growth potential for the creative industries.</li>
  <li>
<b>Existing support for creative businesses</b> - DCMS will look to support regions where the programme can have maximum impact through aligning with other regional support offers but also does not duplicate activity funded by other public or private investment.</li>
</ul>
