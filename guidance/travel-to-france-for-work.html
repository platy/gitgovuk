<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to France to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>The French authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.service-public.fr/" rel="external">French government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in France. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with the French <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in France, so you know which ones to use when speaking to the French authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to France for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>going to court as a witness</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs</li>
  <li>board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers (including entertainment such as eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>carrying out fact-finding visits</li>
  <li>negotiating, signing and executing deals or contracts</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference if you’re not being paid</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>Or for the following types of training, so long as it’s for the same company or group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>classroom-based training</li>
  <li>on-the-job training</li>
  <li>shadowing someone’s job</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check France’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>These don’t require a visa or permit in France if they’re for no more than 90 days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>artists and their technical production team for film, audio-visual content and shows</li>
  <li>fashion and art models</li>
  <li>personal and domestic service workers for an employer who is a private individual permanently based in the UK but staying in France</li>
  <li>auditors and other experts in architecture, engineering, finance, insurance, IT and management working on assignment</li>
  <li>guest professors carrying out occasional teaching</li>
  <li>taking part in sporting, cultural, artistic and scientific events</li>
  <li>taking part in conferences, seminars, and trade exhibitions</li>
  <li>those with an EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) from another country – your employer has to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.formulaires.modernisation.gouv.fr/gf/cerfa_15618.do" rel="external">notify the prefecture</a> of where you’ll be working</li>
</ul>

<p>You would travel under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer has to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sipsi.travail.gouv.fr/#/auth/login" rel="external">submit a secondment declaration on SIPSI</a> at least 1 day before you start work.</p>

<h3>After-sales or after lease services</h3>

<p>You may not need a visa or permit for up to 90 days if you’re providing a service under the terms of a contract or warranty for commercial or industrial equipment. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>installing equipment</li>
  <li>carrying out repairs or maintenance work</li>
  <li>training workers</li>
</ul>

<p>You would travel under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer has to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sipsi.travail.gouv.fr/#/auth/login" rel="external">submit a secondment declaration on SIPSI</a> at least 1 day before you start work.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>an employment confirmation letter</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma or professional certificate</li>
  <li>CV</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">French embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with the French <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>For the short-term permits listed in this guide your family won’t be able to get dependant visas. They can join you for up to 90 days on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.UK/foreign-travel-advice/france/entry-requirements" rel="external">visitor visas</a> or under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver rules</a>.</p>

<p>There may be different rules for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.welcometofrance.com/en/sheet/accompanying-family-simplified-procedure" rel="external">taking families</a> if you have a long-stay permit.</p>

<h3>Short-term and long-stay permits</h3>

<p>You need a short-term work permit if you’re in France for up to 90 days because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#igt">transferring short term from a UK branch of a company to a branch in France</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ftc">working for a French company on a short fixed-term French employment contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing short-term services to a client</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You need to apply for a long-stay work permit if you’re working in France for more than 90 days because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#long-ict">transferring long term to the French branch of a UK-based company</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a French company on a long-term French employment contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#provider">providing long-term services to a client in France</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research work</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Transferring short term to a French branch of a UK-based company</h2>

<p>You need a short-term intra-group transfer permit if your UK-based employer is transferring you to a branch in France for up to 90 days.</p>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have relevant professional experience or a university degree</li>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract</li>
  <li>stay on UK payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>This permit can take 6 to 8 weeks to get.</p>

<p>You need to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#long-ict">long-stay ICT</a> if you’re being transferred for more than 90 days.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>Your employer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://administration-etrangers-en-france.interieur.gouv.fr/particuliers/#/" rel="external">applies for your work permit online</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sipsi.travail.gouv.fr/#/auth/login" rel="external">submits a secondment declaration on SIPSI</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>French authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>CV</li>
  <li>diploma or qualification certificate</li>
  <li>signed employment contract with your UK employer</li>
  <li>assignment letter from your UK employer</li>
  <li>organisational charts or documents showing the relationship between your UK employer and the host company in France</li>
  <li>corporate registration certificates (‘Extrait Kbis’) for the French company</li>
  <li>social security certificate</li>
  <li>proof that the French company is paying social security <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.urssaf.fr/portail/home.html" rel="external">(Urssaf)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working for a French company on a short fixed-term contract</h2>
<p>You need a short-term work permit if you want to work on a fixed-term French contract for up to 90 days.</p>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a signed fixed-term employment contract with a company in France
be on French payroll</li>
  <li>complete a labour market test if your role isn’t on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000017937372/" rel="external">skills shortage list</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The labour market test shows that the French company hasn’t been able to hire workers from France, or the rest of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland.</p>

<p>This permit can take 8 to 16 weeks to get.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>Your employer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://administration-etrangers-en-france.interieur.gouv.fr/particuliers/#/" rel="external">applies for your work permit online</a>.</p>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>French authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>CV</li>
  <li>diploma or qualification certificate (if you have one)</li>
  <li>signed fixed-term employment contract with a French company</li>
