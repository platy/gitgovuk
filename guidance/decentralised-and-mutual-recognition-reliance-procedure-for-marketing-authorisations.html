<p>The intention is that acceptable <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> should be granted within 67 days of MAA validation. The <abbr title="decentralised and mutual recognition procedures Reliance Procedure">MRDCRP</abbr> is not available to products with <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> in European Union Member States granted only through National Procedures.</p>

<p>This document will refer to European Union Member States (although the text applies also to Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>If the company does not have a 5-digit company number, to allow registration on the MHRA Submissions Portal, then this should be requested from <a href="mailto:Reference.Data@mhra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">Reference.Data@mhra.gov.uk</a>.

<h3>Paediatric requirements</h3>
<p>For submissions which will trigger paediatric requirements, applicants should ensure the latest European Union and/or Great Britain-PIP/waiver opinion/decision or class waiver decision is included in the dossier.</p>

<p>If the application has been subject to a European Union or Great Britain compliance check the outcome documents should be included in the dossier. The applicant should also indicate any parallel, ongoing or previous applications containing paediatric data relevant for the full PIP compliance verification (if applicable). An overview table of the PIP results, indicating in which application(s) they were/are going to be submitted, status of the application(s), as well as their location in the present application must be included.</p>

<h3>Cover letter</h3>

</li>
  <li>Indicate whether paediatric requirements will be triggered, and if so, that the paediatric information is included in the dossier.

  <li>If the procedure includes an <abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMF</abbr>, include a declaration that the <abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMF</abbr> Holder has submitted the Applicant’s and Restricted Parts of the <abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMF</abbr>, including approved variations and all iterations of the assessment reports on the Applicant’s and Restricted Parts.</li>

<p>Any points will be sent as a Request for Further Information (<abbr title="Request for Further Information">RFI</abbr>) and the clock will be stopped for up to 28 days to give the Applicant the opportunity to respond.
