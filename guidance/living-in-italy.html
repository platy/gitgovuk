<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Italian Government and your local authority. Get more information from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/homeNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=english" rel="external">Italian Ministry of Healthâ€™s coronavirus site</a>. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy">Italy travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national in Italy, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Italy</a>. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en" rel="external">Italian government guidance on visas</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://conslondra.esteri.it/consolato_londra/en/i_servizi/per_chi_si_reca_in_italia/" rel="external">Italian embassy guidance on visas</a>.</p>

<p>You should carry an identification document with you at all times.</p>

<h2>Hosting guests at your property</h2>

<p>If you host a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national (or any national of a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country) as a guest, you must inform your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questure.poliziadistato.it/servizio/dovesiamo" rel="external">local immigration office</a> (questura) (in Italian). You must do this in writing within 48 hours after they arrive at your property.</p>

<p>You could be fined if you do not comply with this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.esteri.it/mae/normative/normativa_consolare/visti/d_lgs_25_luglio_1998_n_286.pdf" rel="external">Italian immigration law</a> (in Italian).</p>

<p>If you host a national of an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country, you must inform the questura if they plan to stay with you for 30 days or more.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Italy before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you were lawfully living in Italy before 1 January 2021, you and your family members automatically have rights under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>Withdrawal Agreement â€˜carta di soggiornoâ€™</h3>

<p>You have these rights even if you do not have the Withdrawal Agreement â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ (biometric residency card). The Italian governmentâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.politicheeuropee.gov.it/it/sottosegretario/ciae/comitato-tecnico-di-valutazione/riunioni-del-comitato-tecnico-di-valutazione/ctv-26-marzo-2021/" rel="external">carta di soggiorno elettronica guidance for officials</a> (in Italian) confirms that this card is not mandatory. You can show this guidance to service providers if you do not yet have a carta di soggiorno elettronica and you are experiencing difficulties accessing services.</p>

<p>However, the Withdrawal Agreement carta di soggiorno provides the clearest evidence of your rights. This card is a separate document to the biometric identity card (carta dâ€™identita). We strongly recommend that you request the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.interno.gov.it/it/vademecum-i-cittadini-britannici-e-i-loro-familiari-residenti-italia" rel="external">Withdrawal Agreement carta di soggiorno as it provides the clearest evidence of your rights</a> (in Italian). It also shows your right to enter Italy and exempts you from European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<p>To get this card you should book an appointment at your local immigration office at the police headquarters (questura) to have your biometric data taken. This costs 30.46 EUR, and you need to pay with a payment slip which you can get from the post office. Vulnerable people who cannot travel to their local police headquarters to provide their biometric data, will be issued a paper residence card.</p>

<p>If you have been legally resident in Italy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more than 5 years as a permanent resident, you can ask for a 10-year renewable carta di soggiorno elettronica</li>
  <li>less than 5 years, you can ask for a 5-year renewable carta di soggiorno elettronica</li>
  <li>with permanent residence status and you are under 18 years old, you can ask for a 5-year renewable carta di soggiorno elettronica. When you are 18 years old you can ask for a 10-year renewable carta di soggiorno elettronica</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need further information on how to secure your residency, you may find the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://italy.iom.int/it/uk-nationals-support-fund-uknsf-italy" rel="external">International Organization for Migrationâ€™s guidance on residence in Italy</a> useful.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>

<p>If your application for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.interno.gov.it/it/vademecum-i-cittadini-britannici-e-i-loro-familiari-residenti-italia" rel="external">carta di soggiorno elettronica</a> (in Italian) is refused, your local immigration office (questura) will send you a refusal notice.</p>

<p>If you want to appeal, you must send your appeal by recorded delivery (raccomandata con aviso di ricevimento).  The date you post your appeal is used as your appeal submission date.</p>

<p>You have 30 days from the date of the refusal notice to appeal. You must submit your appeal either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as your refusal notice instructs you, or</li>
  <li>to your <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.prefettura.it/portale/multidip/index.htm" rel="external">local â€˜prefectâ€™ or â€˜prefetturaâ€™</a>  (in Italian)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your appeal can only proceed if your grounds for appeal are accepted. You can find more information on the appeals process from <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.prefettura.it/portale/multidip/index.htm" rel="external">your local prefectâ€™s website</a> (in Italian).</p>

<p>We strongly recommend you seek independent, specialised legal advice to support you if you appeal. The British Embassy cannot get involved in individual immigration applications. We cannot provide legal advice as we do not have the authority or expertise.</p>

<p>If your appeal is rejected, you can appeal through your regional administrative tribunal (â€˜Tribunale Amministrativo Regionaleâ€™ or TAR). You have 60 days, from the date you are notified that your first appeal has been refused, to submit your appeal to the TAR.</p>

<p>You can also have the option to appeal to the President of the Republic. You must do this within 120 days of the first refusal notice.</p>

<p>If your appeal is successful, your local questura will contact you to continue with your application for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.interno.gov.it/it/vademecum-i-cittadini-britannici-e-i-loro-familiari-residenti-italia" rel="external">carta di soggiorno elettronica</a> (in Italian).</p>

<p>If your appeal is unsuccessful, you will be notified of the reasons, usually by registered letter. This  letter requires you to acknowledge receipt of the appeal decision.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Italy at any time in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>They must travel to Italy and then apply as your family member within 90 days of arriving. Nationals of certain non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries may need a visa before travel. The Italian authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<h3>Dual nationals</h3>

<p>If you are a dual <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> â€“ Italian national you must register your residency as an Italian national.  You cannot apply for the carta di soggiorno elettronica, but you still have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you are a dual national of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country (but not Italy), you can choose which nationality to register under.</p>

<h3>Police identification checks</h3>

<p>In Italy you should carry an identification document with you at all times. When you have your Withdrawal Agreement carta di soggiorno elettronica, you should carry it with you.</p>

<p>If you and your family members have been lawfully living in Italy since before 1 January 2021, you are not legally required to carry a residency document to prove your rights.</p>

<p>If a police officer asks you for an identification document, you may need to prove your residency status. You can show one of these documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your carta di soggiorno elettronica</li>
  <li>a copy of your current residency document, which is valid until it expires</li>
  <li>the Withdrawal Agreement â€˜attestazione di iscrizione anagraficaâ€™</li>
  <li>other proof of being legally resident in Italy before 1 January 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national â€˜permesso di soggiornoâ€™, and a police officer cannot ask you to show one if you have rights as a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-italy#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Italy.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Italy</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Italy travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>.</p>

<p>If you have citizenship of an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Italy using your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Italy with an Italian residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Italy, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>.</p>

<p>Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Italy before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel carry your residence document (carta di soggiorno elettronica, the attestazione di iscrizione anagrafica or your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency document) or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, carry your receipt of application. You will have been given this when you asked for your carta di soggiorno or registered your residency with your local town hall.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Italy, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Italy with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-italy">guidance on healthcare in Italy</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>If you work in Italy, even if you work for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-based company, this may affect where you pay National Insurance-type contributions. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-italy#national-insurance-and-social-security-contributions">National insurance and social security contributions section</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Italy before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>You have the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">right to work under the Withdrawal Agreement</a> if you were lawfully living in Italy before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you do not yet have a carta di soggiorno, you can show your employer the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.urponline.lavoro.gov.it/s/article/Come-devono-compilare-i-moduli-delle-Comunicazioni-Obbligatorie-i-cittadini-britannici-legalmente-residenti-in-Italia-prima-del-31-dicembre-2020?language=it" rel="external">Ministry of Employmentâ€™s information for employers on registering work contracts for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals</a> (in Italian).</p>

<h2>Professional qualifications</h2>

<p>You may need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in Italy.</p>

<p>Read guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/providing-services-to-any-country-in-the-eu-iceland-liechtenstein-norway-or-switzerland-after-eu-exit#recognition-of-professional-qualifications">recognition of professional qualifications</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>If you were living in Italy before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If the relevant regulator in Italy officially recognised your professional qualification before 1 January 2021, or you started the recognition process by this date, make sure you understand the terms of your decision. You should get advice from the relevant regulator.</p>

<h2>Studying in Italy</h2>

<p>If you plan to study in Italy, you must meet all visa requirements before you travel.</p>

<p>Contact the relevant higher education provider in Italy to check what fees you may have to pay.</p>

<p>Read guidance on:</p>

<ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/study-in-the-european-union">studying in the European Union guidance</a>
includes information if you were already living in Italy before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you were settled in Italy as a student before 1 January 2021 but you did not register as a resident, you should apply for the new Withdrawal Agreement biometric residency card carta di soggiorno from your local immigration office (questura). You should then register your residency with your local town hall.</p>

<p>Read the Italian governmentâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.interno.gov.it/it/vademecum-i-cittadini-britannici-e-i-loro-familiari-residenti-italia" rel="external">guidance on the new Withdrawal Agreement residency document</a> (in Italian).</p>

<p>If you registered as a resident with the town hall before 1 January 2021, you should now request the biometric residency card carta di soggiorno from your local questura. You should also request this if you registered under the â€˜registro della popolazione temporaneaâ€™ (temporary register) using a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued EHIC for your healthcare.</p>

<h2>Tax</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/italy-tax-treaties">double taxation agreement with Italy</a> so that you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Italy. You can find a tax adviser or business consultant (commercialista) at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://britishchamber.it/" rel="external">British Chamber of Commerce for Italy</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cafacli.it/it/" rel="external">Centro Assistenza Fiscale â€“ Tax Assistance Centre (<abbr title="Centro Assistenza Fiscale">CAF</abbr>)</a> (in Italian).</p>

<h3>Declaring your assets</h3>

<p>Check if you need to file an annual declaration of overseas assets using the Quadro RW form (part of the annual Unico tax form). There are severe penalties if you do not file, or give incorrect or incomplete information.</p>

<p>You can get more information from a tax adviser or business consultant (commercialista) at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://britishchamber.it/" rel="external">British Chamber of Commerce for Italy</a>  or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cafacli.it/it/" rel="external">Centro Assistenza Fiscale â€“ Tax Assistance Centre (<abbr title="Centro Assistenza Fiscale">CAF</abbr>)</a> in Italian.</p>

<h2>National insurance and social security contributions</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance">National Insurance-type contributions</a>(NIC) are called â€˜social security contributionsâ€™ (SSC) in Italy. Find out if you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or social security contributions</a> in Italy.</p>

<p>If you plan to move to Italy and work, even if you continue working for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-based company, you and your employer may need to pay social security contributions in Italy. These social security contributions would entitle you to certain benefits, such as healthcare, in Italy.</p>

<h2>Money and banking</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> banking</h3>

<p>Whether <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> banks can provide services to customers living in the EEA depends on local laws and regulation.</p>

<h3>Banking in Italy if you were living there before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you were resident in Italy before 1 January 2021, you do not need to show your Italian bank a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national residency document (permesso di soggiorno) or a biometric residency card (Withdrawal Agreement carta di soggiorno elettronica).</p>

<p>If your bank requests either of these documents, you can show them the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.abi.it/DOC_Mercati/Internazionalizzazione/Brexit/QA%20sulla%20richiesta%20da%20parte%20delle%20banche%20del%20documento%20di%20soggiorno%20ai%20beneficiari%20dell'Accordo_Brexit.pdf" rel="external">Associazione Bancaria Italiana (ABI - Italian Banking Association) guidance</a> (in Italian).</p>

<p>The ABI advises that the non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national permesso di soggiorno is not issued to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, and the carta di soggiorno is not mandatory.</p>

<h2>Accommodation and buying property</h2>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals can buy property or land in Italy whether or not you live there. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-buying-property-abroad">guidance on buying property abroad</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-italy#visas-and-residency">visas and residency section</a> for actions you must take if you have guests staying at your property.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Italy before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>To purchase property, you do not need a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national residency permit (permesso di soggiorno). You may be asked to prove you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. You can do this by providing an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency document such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>attestato di soggiorno (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency document)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attestazione di soggiorno permanente UE (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> permanent residency document)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>certificato di residenza (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency certificate)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively you can provide documents issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>attestazione di iscrizione anagrafica (residency document issued under the Withdrawal Agreement)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>carta di soggiorno elettronica (biometric residency card issued under the Withdrawal Agreement)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are having problems accessing property services, show your public notary this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/italy-property-rights-for-uk-nationals-covered-by-the-withdrawal-agreement">guidance from the Consiglio Nazionale Del Notariato (National Council of Italian Public Notaries)</a> (in Italian).</p>

<h2>Driving in Italy</h2>

<p>You cannot renew or replace your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licence if you live in Italy. You must exchange your licence for an Italian one and you will need to take a driving test. You cannot use an International Driving Permit (IDP) instead of exchanging your licence.</p>

<p>The British and Italian governments continue to negotiate long-term arrangements for exchanging driving licences without needing to take a test.</p>

<p>If you need to drive in Italy, you should not wait for negotiations to conclude before exchanging your valid <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licence.</p>
