<h2>If you were living in Italy before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you were living in Italy since before 1 January 2021. These are indicated with sub-headings.</p>

<p>Italy implements the Agreement through a declaratory system. This means that if you were lawfully living in Italy before 1 January 2021, you automatically have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>You have these rights even if you do not have the new â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ (biometric residency card) issued under the Withdrawal Agreement. You should ask for the new â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™, as it provides the clearest evidence of your rights.</p>

<p>The Italian governmentâ€™s <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.politicheeuropee.gov.it/it/sottosegretario/ciae/comitato-tecnico-di-valutazione/riunioni-del-comitato-tecnico-di-valutazione/ctv-26-marzo-2021/">â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ guidance for officials</a> (in Italian) confirms that the â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ is not mandatory. You can show this guidance to service providers if you do not yet have a â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ and you are experiencing difficulties accessing services.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>You should follow the advice of the Italian Government and your local authority. You can also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy" class="govuk-link">Italy travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national in Italy, see our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<h3>Withdrawal Agreement â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</h3>

<p>If you have lived in Italy since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have the right to request a new residence document, the â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™. This document shows that you have the rights defined in the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>This card is a separate document to the biometric identity card (â€˜carta dâ€™identitaâ€™). We strongly recommend that you request the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.interno.gov.it/it/vademecum-i-cittadini-britannici-e-i-loro-familiari-residenti-italia">carta di soggiorno elettronica</a>. It shows your right to enter Italy and exempts you from European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<p>If you have been legally resident in Italy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more than 5 years as a permanent resident, you can ask for a 10-year renewable â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</li>
  <li>less than 5 years, you can ask for a 5-year renewable â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</li>
  <li>with permanent residence status and you are under 18 years old, you can ask for a 5-year renewable â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™. When you are 18 years old you can ask for a 10-year renewable â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>To ask for the â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ you need to book an appointment at your local immigration office at the police headquarters (questura) in person.</p>

<p>You should read:</p>

<ul>

<h3>Police identification checks</h3>

<p>In Italy by law you must carry identification with you at all times.</p>

<p>If you and your family members have been lawfully living in Italy since before 1 January 2021, you are not legally required to carry a residency document to prove your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If a police officer asks you for an identification document, you may need to prove your status under the Withdrawal Agreement. You can show one of these documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</li>
  <li>a copy of your current residency document , which is valid until it expires</li>
  <li>the Withdrawal Agreement â€˜attestazione di iscrizione anagraficaâ€™</li>
  <li>other proof of being legally resident in Italy before 1 January 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you do not need a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national â€˜permesso di soggiornoâ€™ and a police officer cannot ask you to show one.</p>

<p>When you have your Withdrawal Agreement â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™, you should carry it with you.</p>

<h3>Hosting guests at your property</h3>

<p>If you host a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national (or any non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national) as a guest, you must inform your <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://questure.poliziadistato.it/servizio/dovesiamo">local immigration office</a> (questura) in writing within 48 hours after they arrive at your property.</p>

<p>You could be fined if you fail to comply with this <a rel="external" href="https://www.esteri.it/mae/normative/normativa_consolare/visti/d_lgs_25_luglio_1998_n_286.pdf" class="govuk-link">Italian immigration law</a>.</p>

<p>If you host an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national, you must inform the questura if they plan to stay with you for 30 days or more.</p>

<h3>Moving to Italy</h3>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Italy</a>.</p>

<p>You should also read the <a rel="external" href="https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en" class="govuk-link">Italian government guidance on visas</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://conslondra.esteri.it/consolato_londra/en/i_servizi/per_chi_si_reca_in_italia/" class="govuk-link">Italian embassy guidance on visas</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport in Italy</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">travel advice for Italy</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/default/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a>.</p>

<p>If you have citizenship of an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> / European Free Trade Area (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Italy using your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> / EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Italy with a residence permit or long stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Italy, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>.</p>

<p>Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Italy before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, especially within the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/default/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Schengen area</a>, you should carry with you your residence document (â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™, the â€˜attestazione di iscrizione anagraficaâ€™ or your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency document) or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, carry your certificate of registration.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Italy, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you do not need any extra months on your passport to enter or exit <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-italy" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare in Italy</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2">leaving the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> with medicine that contains a controlled drug</a>, check with the embassy about the rules for the country youâ€™re going to before you travel and the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad">NaTHNaC guidance on travelling with medicines</a>.</p>
