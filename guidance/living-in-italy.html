<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you are registered for public healthcare as a resident in Italy, and are travelling outside of Italy, carry your Italian EHIC (Tessera Europea di Assicurazione Malattia â€“TEAM) with you.
An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>
<p>You should carry your residence document (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> document or new attestazione), as well as your valid passport when you travel.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Italy. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Italy, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Italy.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Italy.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Italy, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<h2>Driving in Italy</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Italy you should obtain an Italian licence. You will need to take a driving test to do so.</p>

<p>If you started the process of exchanging your licence before 1 January 2021, you will not have to take a driving test.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Italy, read the guidance on:</p>

</ul>

<p>If you are in Italy and your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licence is lost, stolen or expires you will not be able to renew it with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You will need to apply to the DVLA for a â€˜certificate of entitlementâ€™ in Italian to be able to apply for an Italian driving licence.</p>

<h3>Bringing a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-registered vehicle to Italy</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If you move to Italy with your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-registered car, you must register your car with Italian licence plates within 60 days of being officially resident in Italy. If not, your car may be impounded.</p>

<p>Be aware that as soon as you start the process of registering your car in Italy you will not be able to use your car, until you get your new documentation and licence plates. For more information, contact an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ilportaledellautomobilista.it/gms/ricerca/-1/Visualizza" rel="external">Ufficio Motorizzazione Civile</a> (in Italian).</p>

<h2>Working in Italy</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Italy before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>If you are planning to come to Italy to work, you may need a <a rel="external" href="https://amblondra.esteri.it/ambasciata_londra/it/ambasciata/ufficio-stampa/news/2020/12/british-citizens-travelling-to.html" class="govuk-link">visa</a>.</p>

<p>To apply for a job, you may need to provide a:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> criminal records certificate</a></li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.giustizia.it/giustizia/it/mg_3_3_2.page;jsessionid=BzBdMl1mPi7QQEFuK50A6lZT?tab=e" class="govuk-link">Italian criminal records certificate</a> (Certificato del casellario giudiziale) issued by the Italian Law Court (Ufficio Casellario Giudiziale c/o Procura della Repubblica, Tribunale)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Italy and were regularly commuting to work in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or EFTA country, before 1 January 2021 you may need a permit to show you are a frontier worker. You must also check that you are correctly registered for residency. Read the Italian governmentâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.interno.gov.it/it/vademecum-i-cittadini-britannici-e-i-loro-familiari-residenti-italia" rel="external">guidance on the new Withdrawal Agreement residency document</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or EFTA country and regularly commuted to work in Italy before 1 January 2021, you do not need a frontier worker permit. However, you can apply for one if you wish. You can obtain a new frontier worker permit from your local immigration office (questura).</p>

<h2>Studying in Italy</h2>

<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Italian nationals, as long as you were legally resident in Italy before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Make sure you are correctly registered for residency and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-italy#healthcare" class="govuk-link">healthcare</a>.</p>

<p>You must have healthcare cover before you can register your residency with your local town hall (comune).</p>

<p>Valid forms of healthcare cover include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying voluntary contributions (iscrizione volontaria) to register for state-funded healthcare</li>
  <li>private healthcare cover</li>
</ul>

<p>A <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued EHIC is not valid as evidence of healthcare when you register. You can temporarily register your presence in Italy with the local town hall via the â€˜registro della popolazione temporaneaâ€™ (temporary register) using a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued EHIC for your healthcare. This registration will ensure you retain your rights in Italy while you are studying here.</p>

<p>Once registered (temporarily or fully) you should obtain the new residency biometric card from your local questura to evidence your rights in Italy.  Read the Italian governmentâ€™s <a href="https://www.interno.gov.it/it/vademecum-i-cittadini-britannici-e-i-loro-familiari-residenti-italia" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on the new Withdrawal Agreement residency document</a>.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a double taxation agreement with Italy to make sure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals living in Italy continue to apply.</p>

<p>Read guidance about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice" class="govuk-link">the tax on your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> income if you live abroad</a></li>

</ul>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Italy. You can find a tax adviser or business consultant (commercialista) at the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://britishchamber.it">British Chamber of Commerce for Italy</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.cafacli.it/it/" class="govuk-link">Centro Assistenza Fiscale â€“ Tax Assistance Centre (<abbr title="Centro Assistenza Fiscale">CAF</abbr>)</a>, or find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/italy-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">English-speaking lawyer</a>.</p>

<h3>Declaration of overseas assets</h3>

<p>Check if you need to file an annual declaration of overseas assets using the Quadro RW form (part of the annual Unico tax form). There are severe penalties if you do not file, or give incorrect or incomplete information.</p>

<p>You can get more information from a tax adviser or business consultant (commercialista) at the <a href="https://britishchamber.it/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">British Chamber of Commerce for Italy</a> or <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.cafacli.it/it/">Centro Assistenza Fiscale â€“ Tax Assistance Centre (<abbr title="Centro Assistenza Fiscale">CAF</abbr>)</a>.</p>
