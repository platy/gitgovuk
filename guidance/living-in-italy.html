<h3>Attend a citizen outreach event</h3>

<p>The British Embassy holds events across Italy for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/meeting-british-citizens-across-italy#outreach">Join one of our online citizensâ€™ outreach meetings</a> to keep up to date on working and living in Italy.</p>

<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Italy before 1 January 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">your rights are protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>Italy implements the Agreement through a declaratory system. This means that if you were lawfully living in Italy before 1 January 2021, you automatically have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. You have these rights even if you do not have the new â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ (biometric residency card) issued under the Withdrawal Agreement. You should ask for the new â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™, as it provides the clearest evidence of your rights.</p>

<p>The Italian governmentâ€™s <a rel="external" href="http://www.politicheeuropee.gov.it/it/sottosegretario/ciae/comitato-tecnico-di-valutazione/riunioni-del-comitato-tecnico-di-valutazione/ctv-26-marzo-2021/" class="govuk-link">â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ guidance for officials</a> (in Italian) confirms that the â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ is not mandatory. You can show this guidance to service providers if you do not yet have a â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ and you are experiencing difficulties accessing services.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<h3>Withdrawal Agreement â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</h3>

<p>If you have been resident in Italy since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members should ask for the new biometric residence card, the â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™. This card is a separate document to the biometric identity card (â€˜carta dâ€™identita).</p>

<p>If you have been legally resident in Italy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more than 5 years as a permanent resident, you can ask for a 10-year renewable â€™carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</li>
  <li>less than 5 years, you can ask for a 5-year renewable â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</li>
  <li>with permanent residence status and you are under 18 years old, you can ask for a 5-year renewable â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™. When you are 18 years old you can ask for a 10-year renewable â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>To ask for the â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™ you need to book an appointment at your local immigration office at the police headquarters (questura) in person.</p>

<p>You should read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/italy-how-to-register-for-the-biometric-residency-card">detailed guidance on how to get the new biometric residence card</a>

</ul>

<h3>Additional support</h3>

<p>If you need additional support to obtain your new biometric residency card (â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™) issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, or to complete your residency application, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-support-fund-uknsf-applying-for-residency-in-eu-or-efta-countries"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Nationals Support Fund</a> guidance.</p>

<h3>Police identification checks</h3>

<p>In Italy by law you must carry identification with you at all times.</p>

<p>If you and your family members have been lawfully living in Italy since before 1 January 2021, you are not legally required to carry a residency document to prove your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If a police officer asks you for an identification document, you may need to prove your status under the Withdrawal Agreement. You can show one of these documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</li>
  <li>a copy of your current residency document , which is valid until it expires</li>
  <li>the Withdrawal Agreement â€˜attestazione di iscrizione anagraficaâ€™</li>
  <li>other proof of being legally resident in Italy before 1 January 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you do not need a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national â€˜permesso di soggiornoâ€™ and a police officer cannot ask you to show one.</p>

<p>When you have your Withdrawal Agreement â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™, you should carry it with you.</p>

<h3>Hosting guests at your property</h3>

<p>If you host a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national (or any non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national) as a guest, you must inform your <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://questure.poliziadistato.it/servizio/dovesiamo">local immigration office</a> (questura) in writing within 48 hours after they arrive at your property. You could be fined if you fail to comply with this <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.esteri.it/mae/normative/normativa_consolare/visti/d_lgs_25_luglio_1998_n_286.pdf">Italian immigration law</a>.</p>

<p>If you host an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> national, you must inform the questura if they plan to stay with you for 30 days or more.</p>

<h3>Moving to Italy</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Italy</a>.</p>

<p>You should also read the <a href="https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Italian government guidance on visas</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en" class="govuk-link">Italian embassy guidance on visas</a>.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>After you have registered your residency, you need to register with the Italian National Health Service (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale â€“ <abbr title="Servizio Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr>) through your local health authority (Azienda Sanitaria Locale â€“ <abbr title="Azienda Sanitaria Locale">ASL</abbr>).</p>

<p>You can register for free with the <abbr title="Servizio Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a work contract, are self-employed in Italy or are an immediate family member of someone who is</li>
  <li>you are an immediate family member of an Italian citizen</li>
  <li>you hold an Attestazione di Soggiorno Permanente</li>
  <li>you become unemployed after having worked in Italy, and register on the employment lists (liste di collocamento). This also applies if you register for a professional training course while you are unemployed</li>
  <li>you hold a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> social security form, such as an S1 form for pensioners</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not qualify for free <abbr title="Servizio Sanitario Nazionale">SSN</abbr> registration, you may be able to pay an annual fee to register. Contact your <abbr title="Azienda Sanitaria Locale">ASL</abbr> to see if you can do this in the region where you live.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-italy" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare in Italy</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>If you are registered for public healthcare as a resident in Italy, and are travelling outside of Italy, carry your Italian EHIC (Tessera Europea di Assicurazione Malattia â€“ TEAM) with you.</p>

</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-italy#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Italy</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Italy, you must not use your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued EHIC or GHIC for healthcare in Italy, unless you are a student or a detached (posted) worker. Current EHICs will remain valid until the expiry date on the card.</p>

<p>If you are living in Italy, you may be eligible for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued EHIC or GHIC if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> student in Italy</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p>The card you receive will depend on when you moved to Italy.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you should carry your residence document (â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™, the â€˜attestazione di iscrizione anagraficaâ€™ or your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency document), as well as your valid passport when you travel.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Italy. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are resident in Italy, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Italy.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Italy.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you will must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a double taxation agreement with Italy to make sure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals living in Italy continue to apply.</p>

<h3>Italian bank requests for a â€˜permesso di soggiornoâ€™ or â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™</h3>

<p>If you were resident in Italy before 1 January 2021, you do not need to show your Italian bank a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> residency document (â€˜permesso di soggiornoâ€™) or a biometric residency card (â€˜carta di soggiorno elettronicaâ€™) issued under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If your bank requests either of these documents, you should show them the <a href="https://www.abi.it/DOC_Mercati/Internazionalizzazione/Brexit/QA%20sulla%20richiesta%20da%20parte%20delle%20banche%20del%20documento%20di%20soggiorno%20ai%20beneficiari%20dell'Accordo_Brexit.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Associazione Bancaria Italiana (ABI - Italian Banking Association) guidance</a> (in Italian).</p>

<p>The ABI advises that the non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> â€˜permesso di soggiornoâ€™ is not issued to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals with rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, and the â€˜carta di soggiornoâ€™ is not mandatory.</p>
