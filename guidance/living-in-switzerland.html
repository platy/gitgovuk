<h2>The UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, you are covered by the Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident. You continue to have broadly the same entitlements to work, study and access public services and benefits.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/switzerland/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Switzerland</a>.</p>

<h3>Residency</h3>

<p>If you were legally resident in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, you can stay and your current residence permit remains valid.</p>

<p>You should reapply for a new permit before your existing one expires. This applies whether you hold a short or long stay permit, or a frontier worker permit.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/fza_schweiz-eu-efta/brexit/faq.html">Swiss government’s FAQs for UK nationals</a>.</p>

<h3>Moving to Switzerland</h3>

<p>You have to meet the terms of the Foreign Nationals and Integration Act. If you are planning to move to Switzerland you have to obtain a work permit and are subject to a quota for UK nationals.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/countries/united-kingdom/en/home/visa/residency.html" class="govuk-link">Swiss Embassy guidance on residency permits</a>.</p>

<p>Within 14 days of arriving you must <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/aufenthalt/eu_efta.html">register at the local office of resident services</a> in the municipality where you are staying (Einwohnerdienste or Centre du contrôle des habitants).</p>

<p>If you stay in Switzerland for more than 90 days, you will need to apply for a residence permit with your local cantonal authority in the municipality where you live (Einwohnerdienste or Centre du contrôle des habitants).</p>

<h3>International permits (cartes de légitimation)</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/missions/mission-onu-geneve/en/home/manual-regime-privileges-and-immunities/introduction/legitimation-card.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">International permits (cartes de légitimation)</a> are not affected by the UK leaving the EU. Special provisions continue to apply to international permit holders wishing to retire and remain in Switzerland.</p>

<p>UK nationals with an international permit are not in the scope of the UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence permit, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your card, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence permit, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Switzerland. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Switzerland, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Switzerland.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a>  before you book your trip. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Switzerland.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Switzerland, and you are in scope of the Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" rel="external">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised bya visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Driving in Switzerland</h2>

<p>If you are resident in Switzerland you have 12 months to swap your UK licence for a Swiss one. You can do this at your local cantonal authority. Your UK licence will be accepted in Switzerland for up to 12 months.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Switzerland, read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/driving-licence/driving-licence-renewal-exchange/index_en.htm">driving licence exchange and renewal</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/switzerland/safety-and-security#road-travel" class="govuk-link">road travel in Switzerland</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When driving in Switzerland, you should always have your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>driving licence</li>
  <li>car papers</li>
  <li>insurance paper</li>
  <li>MOT/Control technique certificate</li>
  <li>passport or ID and those of your passengers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Driving in the UK with a Swiss licence</h3>
<p>You can use your Swiss licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test.</p>

<h3>Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Switzerland</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>If you use your vehicle in Switzerland for more than one year, you need to declare it to customs. You can read the Swiss government’s guidance on <a href="https://www.ch.ch/en/importations-cars-switzerland/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">entering Switzerland with a motor vehicle</a>.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>The UK-Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement protects the rights of UK nationals resident in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, for as long as they remain in scope. Your access to healthcare in Switzerland will not change, as long as you are covered by the agreement.</p>

<p>You must take out compulsory insurance with a Swiss health insurance company no later than 3 months after arriving or beginning to work in Switzerland. You can look at the Swiss government’s website for information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/health-insurance-foreigners/">health insurance for foreigners in Switzerland</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.ch.ch/en/social-insurance-foreign-nationals/" class="govuk-link">social insurance for foreign nationals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are living or working in Switzerland, you need to have <a rel="external" href="https://www.ahv-iv.ch/en/Social-insurances/Old-age-and-survivors-insurance-OASI" class="govuk-link">old-age and survivors’ insurance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ahv-iv.ch/en/Social-insurances/Disability-insurance-DI" rel="external">disability insurance</a>.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-switzerland" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare in Switzerland</a> and make sure you’re correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Switzerland temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-switzerland#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Switzerland and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-switzerland#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Switzerland</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Switzerland, you must not use your UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for healthcare in Switzerland.</p>

<p>If you were living in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Switzerland</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start">Apply now for a new UK <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h2>Working in Switzerland</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>If you are planning to move to Switzerland you have to obtain a work permit and are subject to a quota for UK nationals. Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/countries/united-kingdom/en/home/visa/residency.html" class="govuk-link">Swiss Embassy guidance on residency permits</a>.</p>

<p>If you work 8 hours or more a week, you’re covered against occupational and non-occupational accidents by your employer.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Switzerland and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country before 1 January 2021, you may need a permit to show that you are a frontier worker.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Switzerland to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>
