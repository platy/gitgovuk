</ul>

<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and provides for a deal on citizens’ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the EU broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Cyprus at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Cyprus.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information.</p>

<p>In the meantime, make sure you are registered as a resident in Cyprus. We will update this guidance as soon as more information becomes available.</p>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Cyprus before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, you will be able to continue to live, work and access services as you do now.</p>

<p>You must register as a Cypriot resident if you plan to stay in Cyprus for more than 3 months. You will get a <a rel="external" href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/CRMD/crmd.nsf/All/B20E184509AB8C5DC2257D1F001EF6F2?OpenDocument" class="govuk-link">registration certificate</a> from the Ministry of the Interior, Civil Registry and Migration Department. <a rel="external" href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/contact_en/contact_en?OpenDocument&ExpandSection=7#_Section7" class="govuk-link">Contact details are available here</a>.</p>

UK National Support Fund</p>

<p>On 6 March 2020 the [FCO announced funding[(https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-allocates-3-million-to-support-uk-nationals-in-the-eu) for organisations to provide practical support to UK nationals who may find it harder to complete their residency applications. </p>

<p>These organisations will help individuals who may find it harder to complete the necessary paperwork to secure their residency rights, including pensioners, disabled people, those living in remote areas or who have mobility difficulties, and those who require help with language translation or interpretation. 
In Cyprus, two organisations are providing this practical support: SSAFA (specifically for armed forces veterans) and Cyprus Residency Planning Group (CRPG). If you or someone you know may find it harder to complete the paperwork, you can contact them using the details below to discuss how they may be able to help you.</p>

<p>SSAFA:  800 77058 (freephone)
Mon - Fri 09.00-17.30 
ukvie.support@ssafa.org.uk</p>

<p>CRPG:   800 09009 (freephone)
Mon – Fri 09.00-13.00
contactus@cyprus-crpg.org</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Cyprus</a>.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid before you book your trip. You’ll need to renew your passport before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay in Cyprus. However, if you’re travelling to the north of Cyprus, their administration advises that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry to the north.</p>

<p>We will update these pages with details of any changes to the rules as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-cyprus" class="govuk-link">sign up for updates to this guidance</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are living in Cyprus or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Cyprus as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>You must be properly registered for healthcare as a resident in Cyprus, as well as registering, where necessary, with a health insurer.</p>

<p>Once you are registered as resident, you may be entitled to state healthcare. You should check with the Ministry of Health or at your local citizen service centre to see if you are covered.</p>

<p>You can find information about the new <a rel="external" href="https://www.gesy.org.cy/" class="govuk-link">Cypriot state healthcare system GESY on their website</a>. We strongly advise you to take out private medical insurance if you are not eligible for state healthcare.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Cyprus and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://contactcentreservices.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/selfnhsukokb/AskUs_EHIC/en-gb/6696/application-forms-and-evidence/16477/s1-form-what-is-this-and-how-do-i-obtain-one" class="govuk-link">apply for an S1 certificate</a> through the Business Services Authority.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Cyprus, you must not use a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Cyprus.</p>

<p>When you travel from Cyprus for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state- provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a> and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>If you are travelling, make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance. The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment are not covered. The EHIC is also not valid in north Cyprus.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in an EU country</a>.</p>

<p>To apply for a job you may need to provide a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Cyprus on or before 31 December 2020, your right to work will stay the same, as long as you remain resident in Cyprus.</p>

<h2 id="education-and-professional-qualifications">Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>If you are legally resident in Cyprus on or before 31 December 2020, your right to study in Cyprus will stay the same, as long as you remain a resident in Cyprus.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-students-in-the-eu-continuing-your-studies" class="govuk-link">continuing your studies in EU countries</a>.</p>

<h3 id="professional-qualifications">Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>If you have already been recognised by an EU country as holding valid professional qualifications, this will remain valid after 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you have not had your professional qualifications recognised, you can submit an application under the current rules until 31 December 2020.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyprus-tax-treaties" class="govuk-link">double taxation agreement</a> with Cyprus to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Cyprus have not changed.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk" class="govuk-link">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Cyprus. Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyprus-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">an English-speaking lawyer in Cyprus</a>.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU or EEA and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad" class="govuk-link">tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Cyprus, you can claim:</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-31-january-2020">Pensions after 31 January 2020</h3>

<p>There will be no changes before 31 December 2020 to the rules on claiming the UK State Pension in the EU, EEA or Switzerland as a result of the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<p>You can continue to receive your UK State Pension if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland and you can still claim your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020 you will get your UK State Pension uprated every year for as long as you continue to live there. This will happen even if you start claiming your pension on or after 1 January 2021, as long as you meet the qualifying conditions explained in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">new State Pension guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you are living in Cyprus by 31 December 2020, you will be able to count future social security contributions towards meeting the qualifying conditions for your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Cyprus, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Cypriot pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/benefits-and-pensions-for-uk-nationals-in-the-eea-or-switzerland" class="govuk-link">guidance on benefits and pensions in the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Cyprus.</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad" class="govuk-link">guidance on which UK benefits you can claim while you’re abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad" class="govuk-link">tool to check which benefits you can claim while abroad</a>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals" class="govuk-link">request proof of the time you’ve worked in the UK from HMRC if you are asked for this</a>.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020, you will continue to receive any UK benefits you already receive. This will continue for as long as you live there and meet all other eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Cyprus, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Cypriot contribution-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim your pension after 31 December 2020.</p>
