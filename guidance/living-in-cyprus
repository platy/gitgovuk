<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cyprus/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Cyprus</a>.</p>

<p>You must register as a Cypriot resident if you plan to stay in Cyprus for more than 3 months. You will get a <a rel="external" href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/CRMD/crmd.nsf/All/B20E184509AB8C5DC2257D1F001EF6F2?OpenDocument">registration certificate</a> from the Ministry of the Interior, Civil Registry and Migration Department.</p>

<p>After living in Cyprus for more than 5 years, you can <a rel="external" href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/CRMD/crmd.nsf/All/B20E184509AB8C5DC2257D1F001EF6F2?OpenDocument">apply for permanent residence</a> (MEU3).</p>

<h3 id="residency-and-visas-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency and visas after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>After the UK leaves the EU, the <a rel="external" href="http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/All/C482CD407E0903D8C225830E00384072">Cypriot government has issued guidance on EU Exit</a> and residency in Cyprus in both a deal and no deal scenario.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves with a deal, travel to the EU will remain the same as now until at least 31 December 2020. You will not need to apply for a visa to travel or work in the EU during this time.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the rules for travelling or working in Europe will change after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>In a no deal situation, the <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6402_en.htm">European Commission</a> has proposed that British citizens would not need a visa for short stays in the EU, including Cyprus. You would be able to stay in Cyprus for up to 90 days in any 180-day period.</p>

<p>Visits to Cyprus within the previous 180 days before your date of travel will count against the 90-day limit. As Cyprus is not in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a>, visits to other EU countries will not count against this total.</p>

<p>On arrival, you may be asked to confirm that you have sufficient funds available for the duration of your stay. As non-EEA nationals, different border control checks will apply, and you may also be asked to show a return or onward ticket. UK nationals would not have an ongoing right to use the separate lanes provided for EU, EEA and Swiss nationals.</p>

<p>The Republic of Cyprus does not recognise the self-declared ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’ in the north of Cyprus, nor residence permits issued by the administration there. After the UK leaves the EU, the Republic of Cyprus intends to treat UK visitors, including those travelling to or from the north, as other non-EU nationals for visa purposes, unless they are registered as resident in the Republic.</p>

<p>The current practice in the Republic is for non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to be admitted for 90 days, and for passports to be stamped accordingly. If that happens, the Republic of Cyprus authorities may count time spent in the north of Cyprus towards the 90 day visa free total. If you overstay, you may potentially face difficulties at the airport on exit or re-entry. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/open-letter-to-britons-resident-in-the-north-of-cyprus">Further guidance is available here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re intending to stay for longer than 90 days, or your stay would take you over the 90 days in the 180-day limit, you may need to get a visa before you travel.</p>

<p>The 90-day visa-free period does not entitle you to work. You should check with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mfa.gov.cy/highcomlondon">Republic of Cyprus High Commission in London</a> what type of visa, if any, you will need.</p>

<p>If you are a resident in Cyprus, you are advised to carry your Republic of Cyprus-issued residency documents when entering/exiting the Republic of Cyprus. If you are not a resident in the Republic of Cyprus and cannot show that you hold a residency document, you will likely be subject to the 90-day limit rule.</p>

<p>If you’re planning a stay of longer than 3 months, see our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-cyprus">Living in Cyprus</a> guide and contact the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mfa.gov.cy/highcomlondon">Republic of Cyprus High Commission in London</a> if you have further questions.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Cyprus</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-eu-exit">Passports and travel after EU Exit</h3>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay in Cyprus; you don’t need any additional period of validity on your passport beyond this. However, if you’re travelling to the north of Cyprus, their administration advises that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry to the north.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU Member State, you will be able to transit through other EU Member States to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>Adult and child passports should have at least 6 months’ validity remaining on your date of travel. If you renewed your passport early, extra months would have been added to your new passport. Any extra months on an adult passport will not count towards the validity requirement, so some passport holders will need to have more than 6 months remaining in order to travel.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport here</a>.You can look at our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cyprus">travel advice for Cyprus</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You should ensure you are properly registered for healthcare as a resident in Cyprus, as well as registering, where necessary, with a health insurer.</p>

<p>Once you are registered as resident, you may be entitled to state healthcare. You should check with the Ministry of Health or at your local citizen service centre to see if you are covered.</p>

<p>You can find information about the new <a rel="external" href="https://www.gesy.org.cy/sites/Sites?d=Desktop&locale=en_US&lookuphost=/en-us/&lookuppage=home-en">Cypriot state healthcare system GESY on their website</a>. We strongly advise you to take out private medical insurance if you are not eligible for state healthcare.</p>

<p>You can read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-cyprus/">who is able to access healthcare in Cyprus and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Cyprus and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Cyprus, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Cyprus.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages</a> and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>. You can find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyprus-list-of-hospitals">English-speaking doctors in Cyprus</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions</a> are legal in Cyprus.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Cyprus will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Cyprus.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, access to healthcare for British nationals travelling or living in the EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland is likely to change. More information about healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Cyprus is available on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-cyprus/">NHS website</a>.</p>

<p>The UK has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation and health insurance provided by EHICs and S1 forms with EU member states, including Cyprus, until the end of December 2020.  If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and there is no arrangement with Cyprus to continue reciprocal healthcare, health insurance provided by EHICs and SI pensioner enrolment in the local health system may stop on No Deal exit day.</p>

<p>You should take action now to confirm your residency status and decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. UK nationals will be able to return to the UK for treatment.</p>

<p>Whether you’re travelling before or after the UK leaves the EU, it is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that includes cover for emergency medical treatment and associated costs.</p>

<p>The existing EHIC arrangements are not an alternative to travel insurance, as some health-related costs, including for medical repatriation, ongoing medical treatment and non-urgent treatment, are not covered. The EHIC is also not valid in north Cyprus. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">Read more about what your travel insurance should cover</a>.</p>

<p>You should read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-cyprus">healthcare for UK nationals living in Cyprus</a> and how it may change after UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-cyprus">Working in Cyprus</h2>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in Cyprus, you have the right to work in Cyprus. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK Police certificate</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-cyprus-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Cyprus after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, you should read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cyprus-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyprus-tax-treaties">double-taxation agreement</a> with Cyprus to make sure that people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Cyprus. Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyprus-list-of-lawyers">an English-speaking lawyer in Cyprus</a>.</p>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the EU.
