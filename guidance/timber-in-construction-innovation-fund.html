<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Timber in Construction (<abbr title="Timber in Construction">TiC</abbr>) Innovation Fund has been designed to increase the volume of carbon stored in the built environment. By using more timber in construction, carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere, storing it in products with a long service life. Through the fund, up to £1.5 million will be made available by March 2025 to support the development of innovative timber products, supply chains and ways of working with wood. When sourced responsibly, timber can be considered a truly sustainable material, and the 25 Year Environment Plan, England Trees Action Plan and Net Zero Strategy commits us to work closely with others to increase the use of timber in construction. More widespread use of wood-based products has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of construction, whilst locking away carbon long term and driving investment into tree planting and establishment. Increasing the use of English hardwood timber can help owners improve the ecological condition of their woodland, address tree health problems and increase resilience to climate change.</p>

<p>The UK imports 80% of the timber it consumes and is the second largest importer of timber in the world. The vast majority of these products are softwood based. British grown softwood products are already widely used in construction, but there is scope to further increase demand and use of this resource by replacing imported products such as plywood and/or providing the base material for new construction systems such as off-site construction. Only a small proportion of our hardwood resource is suitable for use in conventional sawn timber products but could potentially be used in composite products. British hardwood could be mixed with softwood in some product ranges and there is potential to develop new ways of working with this underutilised resource. Other new products designed for modular timber construction also have potential to combine the benefits of using a sustainable low-carbon material with reduced waste, lower costs, and shorter installation programs.</p>

<p>Through the <abbr title="Timber in Construction">TiC</abbr> Innovation Fund, capital grant support for innovative project work will be available for a period of up to three years (ending March 2025). In order to be eligible for funding, proposals must have a minimum total value of £20K, and a maximum value of £100K per year (up to £300K over a period of three years).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The Forestry Commission will be hosting a Timber in Construction Innovation Fund: How to apply webinar event at 15:00 on Thursday 24 March. During this session, applicants will have the opportunity to ask questions about the Forestry Innovation Fund application and evaluation processes. If you would like to attend the Timber in Construction Innovation Fund: How to apply webinar, please email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:wimfif@forestrycommission.gov.uk">wimfif@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The objective of this grant is to increase and facilitate the use of sustainable English wood and wood fibre in construction from sustainably managed English woods and forests. Through the innovation fund, applicants are encouraged to develop new timber products for use in construction, or new methods of construction that will enable greater use of English timber.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for funding, applicants must demonstrate how their proposals are innovative and will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase the use of home-grown English timber in construction</li>
  <li>increase the amount of carbon stored in the built environment</li>
  <li>bring novel or improved wood-rich products, systems and/ or processes to market</li>
</ul>

<p>By supporting projects that will increase and facilitate the use of English timber in construction, the <abbr title="Timber in Construction">TiC</abbr> Innovation fund aims to increase demand for domestically produced timber and, by extension, encourage areas of previously unmanaged woodland into active management.</p>

<p>We are particularly interested in projects that develop collaborative working amongst forestry businesses, conservation bodies and private woodland owners, and from projects that will help to sustain woodland management and creation in England. Projects may incorporate an element of original research but must include some practical application. Where possible, applicants should demonstrate how their proposals will help to sustain woodland management and creation in England.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Timber in Construction">TiC</abbr> Innovation Fund is open to a wide range of applicants from both public and private sectors, and we would strongly encourage collaborative bids. Wood processors, manufacturers and construction companies amongst others are identified as likely potential applicants to the fund. Lead applicants must be based in England to be eligible for funding but may partner with organisations based anywhere in the world. Applications from Forest Research (FR) will only be considered eligible where collaboration with external, private sector, organisations is clearly demonstrated. Research and Development in the following areas are suggested as likely to fall within scope:</p>

<ul>
  <li>development of new wood-rich modular and/or offsite timber construction systems that will meet or exceed current building standards for energy performance</li>
  <li>development of new long-lived softwood-based components and/or products suitable for use in construction</li>
  <li>development of new long-lived hardwood-based components and/or products suitable for use in construction</li>
  <li>development of new ways of building with wood</li>
  <li>development of new engineered timber products</li>
  <li>development of new modular timber construction systems</li>
  <li>solutions to overcome supply chain barriers for hardwood timber suitable for use in sawn or composite materials</li>
  <li>testing innovative products to ensure product performance is fit for purpose and complies with current environmental and materials standards</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive, and the FC would welcome other innovative proposals that demonstrate alignment with the <abbr title="Timber in Construction">TiC</abbr> fund objectives and eligibility criteria listed above.</p>

<h2>What funding is available</h2>
<p>In 2022/23, up to £500K will be made available through the Timber in Construction Innovation Fund to support innovative project work. Proposals, whether single or multi-year, must have a minimum total cost of £20K to be eligible for funding under the WiM Forestry Innovation Funds. Projects may be costed at up to a maximum of £100K in any given financial year.</p>

<p>Eligible costs that may be claimed will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personnel costs related to researchers, and other supporting staff to the extent employed on the project</li>
  <li>costs of equipment for the period of the project. Where such equipment is not used for their full life only the depreciation costs corresponding to the life of the project shall be eligible</li>
  <li>costs of contractual research, knowledge and patents bought or licensed from outside sources at arm’s-length conditions, as well as costs of consultancy and equivalent services used exclusively for the project</li>
  <li>operating expenses, including costs of materials, supplies and similar products, incurred directly as a result of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>The following expenditure is ineligible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>costs or overheads such as rent, and utilities apportioned to those staff directly or indirectly employed on the project</li>
  <li>travel and subsistence expenses (including fuel and refreshments at meetings)</li>
  <li>costs incurred outside of the project delivery window</li>
