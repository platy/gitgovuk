<p>Businesses that were open as usual and were then required to close due to local Tier 2, Tier 3 or Tier 4 restrictions may be eligible for LRSG (Closed) or LRSG (Closed) Addendum: Tier 4.</p>

<p>Eligible businesses are entitled to a cash grant from their local council for each 14 day period they are closed.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h2>Application deadline</h2>

<p>The deadline to apply for the LRSG (Closed) and LRSG (Closed) Addendum: Tier 4 schemes is 31 March 2021.</p>
</div>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>You can apply for a grant if your business is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in an area of local Tier 2 or Tier 3 restrictions and has been required to close because of local restrictions that resulted in a first full day of closure on or after 9 September</li>
  <li>in an area of local Tier 4 restrictions and has been required to close because of local restrictions that resulted in a first full day of closure on or after 19 December</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to show that your business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is based in England</li>
  <li>occupies property on which it pays business rates (and is the ratepayer)</li>
  <li>has been required to close for at least 14 days because of the restrictions</li>
  <li>has been unable to provide its usual in-person customer service from its premises</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, this could include pubs and restaurants that operate primarily as an in-person venue, but which have been forced to close those services and provide a takeaway-only service instead.</p>

<p>Eligible businesses can get one grant for each non-domestic property within the restriction area.</p>

<h3>Businesses excluded from the fund</h3>

<p>You cannot get funding if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can continue to operate during the period of restrictions because you do not depend on providing direct in-person services from your premises (for example, accountants)</li>
  <li>local restrictions are introduced for less than 14 days or you are closed for less than 14 days</li>
  <li>you have chosen to close, but have not been required to close as part of local restrictions</li>
  <li>your businesses has been subject to national closures since 23 March 2020, such as nightclubs (these are eligible for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-your-nightclub-dance-hall-or-adult-entertainment-business-is-eligible-for-a-coronavirus-grant-due-to-national-restrictions">other grant support</a>)</li>
  <li>your business is in administration, insolvent, subject to a striking-off notice or has been struck off the Companies House register</li>
  <li>you have exceeded the permitted subsidy limit</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must notify your local council if your situation changes and you no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
</div>

<h3>Subsidy allowance</h3>

<p>The new domestic subsidy allowance for the COVID-19 business support grants took effect on 4 March 2021. Applications made prior to that date are subject to the previous rules.</p>

<p>This scheme is covered by 3 subsidy allowances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small Amounts of Financial Assistance Allowance – you’re allowed up to £335,000 (subject to exchange rates) over any period of 3 years</li>
  <li>COVID-19 Business Grant Allowance – you’re allowed up to £1,600,000</li>
  <li>COVID-19 Business Grant Special Allowance - if you have reached your limits under the Small Amounts of Financial Assistance Allowance and COVID-19 Business Grant Allowance, you may be able to access a further allowance of funding under these scheme rules of up to £9,000,000, provided certain conditions are met</li>
</ul>

<p>Grants under these 3 allowances can be combined for a potential total allowance of up to £10,935,000 (subject to exchange rates).</p>

<h2>What you get</h2>

<p>The grant will be based on the rateable value of the property on the first full day of local restrictions.</p>

<p>If your business has a property with a rateable value of £15,000 or less, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £667 for each 14 day period your business is closed.</p>

<p>If your business has a property with a rateable value over £15,000 and less than £51,000, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £1,000 for each 14 day period your business is closed.</p>

<p>If your business has a property with a rateable value of £51,000 or above, you may be eligible for a cash grant of £1,500 for each 14 day period your business is closed.</p>

<p>The grant will be extended to cover each additional 14-day period of closure. If your business is closed for 28 days, or 2 payment cycles, it will receive £1,334, £2,000 or £3,000, depending on the rateable value of the property.</p>
