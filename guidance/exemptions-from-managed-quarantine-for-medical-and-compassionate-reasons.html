<h2>Red list update, Sunday 28 November 2021</h2>

<p>South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe moved onto the red list at 12.00 midday Friday 26 November.</p>

<p>Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia moved onto the red list at 4am Sunday 28 November.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">Check which countries and territories are on the red list and read the red list rules</a>.</p>

<p>You should follow different guidance if you have not been in a country on the red list in the 10 days before you arrive in England.</p>

<p>Managed quarantine means staying in a specific hotel which has been set up to help protect the UK from new and potentially harmful variants of Coronavirus.</p>

<p>You only need to stay in managed quarantine (a quarantine hotel) if you arrive in England from a country that’s on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">England’s Coronavirus red list</a> or have spent time in one of these countries in the 10 days before your arrival in England. You must stay in a quarantine hotel for 10 days.</p>

<p>This page tells you about not having to quarantine in a quarantine hotel for medical reasons only.</p>

<h2>Medical exemption from hotel quarantine</h2>

<p>We may decide that you don’t need to stay in a quarantine hotel because of your health and that you should quarantine somewhere else instead. This is known as a ‘medical exemption from managed quarantine’.</p>

<p>It’s very rare for anyone to get a medical exemption from managed quarantine.</p>

<p>You need to apply for a medical exemption.</p>

<p>You can only get a medical exemption if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are vulnerable because of a severe medical or health condition</li>
  <li>you need support to manage your medical or health condition, for example to remain stable, function normally, manage pain or reduce the risk of developing further medical conditions</li>
  <li>the quarantine hotel can’t provide you with access to the support you reasonably need</li>
  <li>your condition would be severely detrimentally impacted if you stayed in a quarantine hotel without this support</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/contents" rel="external" class="govuk-link">full reasons for getting a medical exemption in the International Travel Regulations</a>.</p>

<h2>How to apply for a medical exemption</h2>

<p>You can apply for yourself or someone else can apply for you.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Send an email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MQS_New_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk">MQS_New_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk</a>  with this information:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>name, date of birth and address of the person you want to get the exemption for</li>
  <li>planned travel dates</li>
  <li>current location (city and country)</li>
  <li>which port of entry in England you wish to travel to (for example, Heathrow Airport, London)</li>
  <li>reason for travelling to England</li>
</ul>

<p>2. When you’ve sent your first email, you will get an automated reply with a list of questions.</p>

<p>Answer the questions and attach your medical evidence to this email and send it back to us.</p>

<p>The evidence you send us must include information from a suitably qualified or registered medical practitioner to prove:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your severe medical or health condition</li>
  <li>the support you reasonably need in the quarantine hotel in order to manage your severe medical or health condition</li>
  <li>the probable impact to your health if you had to stay in a quarantine hotel for 10 days without the necessary support</li>
</ul>

<p>The medical practitioner should think about whether you could get the medical support you need in a quarantine hotel. For example, support over the telephone or by a family member joining you in quarantine.</p>

<p>Please show this guidance page to the medical practitioner who supplies the evidence that you send us with your application.</p>

<p>We’ll use the information you send us in this email to decide if you’ll get a medical exemption or not.</p>

<p>If you send multiple emails you risk delaying your application.</p>

<h3>When to apply</h3>

<p>Finish and send us your application for an exemption at least 14 days before you travel to England. This gives us time to look at the evidence and make a decision on your application.</p>

<p>If you don’t apply for an exemption 14 days before you travel, we may not be able to make a decision before you arrive in England. If that happens, you’ll need to book and pay to enter a quarantine hotel before you arrive in England.</p>

<p>Complex cases may take longer to consider.</p>

<h2>After you apply</h2>

<h3>How decisions are made</h3>

<p>We’ll look at your individual circumstances when we make our decision.</p>

<p>We may not agree to an exemption before you arrive in England if you make a request less than 14 days before you travel.</p>

<p>We’ll send you our decision in a letter by email.</p>

<p>Please check your email junk or spam folder for emails from us.</p>

<h3>If you don’t get an exemption</h3>

<p>If you don’t get a medical exemption you must stay in a quarantine hotel when you arrive in England. If you are concerned about this, you may wish to delay your travel or change your journey, for example by staying in a country that’s not on the red list for 10 days before you come to England.</p>

<p>If you decide to travel and you need support during your stay in a quarantine hotel, it’s important that you tell us your requirements and/or medical conditions when you make your <a href="https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">managed quarantine booking</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of medical conditions and/or requirements that you should tell us about before your visit include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a registered disability, for example, visual impairment</li>
  <li>needing a carer to stay in an adjoining room</li>
  <li>requiring a room equipped with disabled facilities, for example, walk-in showers</li>
  <li>specific dietary requirements, for example, due to a food allergy</li>
</ul>

<h3>Asking us to look again at our decision</h3>

<p>If we don’t give you a medical exemption from managed quarantine, you may ask us to think again about that decision. This is called an administrative review.</p>

<p>You may request this review at any time, including during your stay in the quarantine hotel.</p>

<p>If you wish to request an administrative review, you should email the managed quarantine service (MQS) at <a href="mailto:MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk</a>. In the email, clearly say that you are asking for a review.</p>

<p>Email us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of why you think the initial decision was incorrect</li>
  <li>additional evidence if you have any</li>
  <li>the reference number of your initial request</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you do get an exemption</h3>

<p>If we say you don’t have to stay in a quarantine hotel, you’ll still have to quarantine in an alternative location, such as your home or the home of a friend or family member.</p>

<p>You’ll need to show evidence on arrival in England that you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an official exemption letter stating that you do not have to quarantine in a quarantine hotel</li>
  <li>booked and paid for the day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 tests</li>
</ul>

<p>See more information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-and-test-at-home-if-youve-been-in-a-red-list-country-and-have-permission-to-quarantine-at-home#checks-to-make-sure-youre-following-quarantine-rules" class="govuk-link">what you must do when you get a medical exemption</a>.</p>

<h4>People travelling with you</h4>

<p>If we decide that you do not have to stay in a quarantine hotel, that decision only applies to you. It does not automatically apply to anybody else that you’re travelling with.</p>

<p>A person travelling with you, who provides care for your medical or health condition, may also get permission to quarantine with you in a different location from  a quarantine hotel. They will only get this permission if it allows them to support you while quarantining at the alternative place.</p>

<p>If you get an exemption and you’re travelling with a child (aged under 18), the child will still have to stay in a quarantine hotel. The child may stay in the quarantine hotel with another parent, guardian or appropriate adult who has travelled as part of your group.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a child and there is no other appropriate adult in your group, your child may be able to get an exemption from staying in a quarantine hotel. Please tell us when you apply if you think this may apply to you.</p>
