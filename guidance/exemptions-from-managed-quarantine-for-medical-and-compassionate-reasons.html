<p>Managed quarantine is intended to help protect the UK from potentially harmful variants of coronavirus. There is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managed-quarantine-what-to-expect/managed-quarantine-what-to-expect">support available to those who must stay in managed quarantine</a>. If you need support from a family member, they should join you in managed quarantine.</p>

<p>There are some very limited instances where you might be able to get an exemption from needing to enter managed quarantine. These exemptions are exceptional and limited, and you will need evidence to support your request.</p>

<p>This guidance includes information on the type of evidence you must submit to support an application for an exemption. All medical evidence must be provided by accredited healthcare professionals.</p>

<p>If you’re granted a medical or compassionate exemption, you’ll be expected to quarantine at home (or at your final destination) for the full quarantine period. You’ll also need to take polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on day 2 and day 8, booked through <a href="https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Corporate Travel Management (CTM)</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone else living at the same location as you must also quarantine for the full quarantine period, regardless of their vaccination status. They will not be required to take a test.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-and-test-at-home-if-youve-been-in-a-red-list-country-and-have-permission-to-quarantine-at-home" class="govuk-link">Read more about the quarantine and testing requirements for you and your household if you have a medical or compassionate exemption from managed quarantine</a></p>

<h2>Medical reasons</h2>

<p>When an individual is travelling from a ‘red list’ country and in need of urgent medical assistance, they do not have to quarantine in a managed quarantine facility. This is because it is expected they will immediately transfer into hospital and will undergo necessary testing and isolation there.</p>

<p>The public health risk of variants of concern is significant. It is preferable, in order to mitigate that risk, for individuals travelling from ‘red list’ countries to enter managed quarantine to reduce the risk to the UK.</p>

<p>However, there are some extremely limited circumstances where due to pre-existing severe medical conditions or vulnerabilities, an individual may be incapable of entering a managed quarantine facility because they cannot be supported there. There is a package of medical and welfare support in managed quarantine available to all, and emergency healthcare is available. We would not expect all individuals with a pre-existing medical condition to request or receive an exemption from entering a managed quarantine facility.</p>

<h3>What conditions must be met to qualify for an exemption</h3>

<p>An exemption will only be granted where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the existing medical condition or vulnerability is severe</li>
  <li>sufficient evidence is provided that the needs of the individual cannot be met either through the provision at the managed quarantine facility, or from a household member joining the individual in managed quarantine</li>
  <li>the medical condition or vulnerability will worsen in managed quarantine to such a significant degree that emergency treatment may become necessary</li>
  <li>clinical evidence is supplied, providing clear evidence of existing treatment and conditions, explaining the risk to the patient – and this evidence must be satisfactory to the assessor</li>
  <li>any evidence provided in support of the application for an exemption is provided from a registered and suitably qualified healthcare professional with direct oversight of the individual’s care and provision for that condition – we do not generally expect this to be provided by your GP or equivalent in other countries</li>
</ul>

<h3>What kinds of medical conditions might qualify for an exemption</h3>

<p>The kinds of medical conditions and supporting evidence that may be considered to require an exemption from managed quarantine might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a debilitating breathing difficulty where regular physiotherapy is necessary to support the lungs, or daily access to oxygen or a nebuliser might be required, and a physiotherapist or consultant advises it is not possible to manage in a managed quarantine facility</li>
  <li>a severe mental health condition where a psychiatrist (for example) advises it would not be possible to maintain stability within a managed quarantine facility and emergency treatment may be required</li>
  <li>severe cognitive disability that makes it unlikely an individual may be able to maintain personal hygiene and may become distressed if left alone, on the advice of a registered healthcare professional of suitable clinical expertise</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supplying evidence and how it’s assessed</h3>

<p>Evidence must be supplied from the healthcare professional, applying professional clinical judgement on the basis of past treatment, and an assessment of whether it is possible for adequate care to be provided in a managed quarantine facility. This assessment includes considering whether additional medical support could be provided by telephone, or by a family member joining an individual in quarantine.</p>

<p>This will need to be assessed against the public health risk of variants of concern and conditions may be placed on any exemption.</p>

<h3>Exemptions for minors accompanied by parents, guardians or carers</h3>

<p>Where the exemption is for a young person under the age of 18 who is travelling with a parent/guardian or carer, an exemption may also be given to the person accompanying them if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is no means of alternative care evidenced for that minor in the home environment</li>
  <li>the individual is physically unable to care for themselves and is travelling with a carer, there is evidence that there is no alternative provision, and it is advised that it is essential for that carer to quarantine with the individual</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if a medically exempt individual is a minor, and travelling with more than one parent, or a larger household, only one parent/guardian/appropriate adult will be permitted an exemption and the rest of the household will be required to enter managed quarantine.</p>

<h2>Compassionate reasons</h2>

<p>In extremely limited circumstances, where it is not possible to accommodate a visit to a severely ill or dying relative or member of your household from within managed quarantine, you may be able to be exempt.</p>

<p>You will need to supply evidence, including from the hospice or medical facility that you will be visiting.</p>

<h2>How to apply for an exemption</h2>

<p>An exemption only applies to an individual and not the household travelling with the individual.</p>

<p>To apply for an exemption for medical or compassionate reasons email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk">MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll receive an automated response with a list of questions that you need to answer. Your responses are used to assess your application.</p>

<p>You should include supporting medical evidence. If you do not include this information your application is not likely to be approved.</p>

<p>If you send multiple emails you risk delaying your application.</p>

<p>If you’re an MP enquiring about an exemption application from a constituent, email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MQSMPEnquiries@dhsc.gov.uk">MQSMPEnquiries@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Check your email junk or spam folder for responses.</p>

<h3>When to apply for an exemption</h3>

<p>You must apply for an exemption at least 14 days ahead of travel. This is to allow enough time for your evidence to be assessed.</p>

<p>If you do not apply within this time you may not receive your exemption in time for you to travel.</p>

<p>You will then need to book and pay to enter a managed quarantine facility on arrival.</p>

<h3>How decisions are made</h3>

<p>Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, and an exemption may not be granted in advance.</p>

<p>Decisions will be communicated in writing. You will need to present evidence on arrival at the border that you have been granted an exemption and to have booked and paid for the day 2 and day 8 tests.</p>

<h3>What else you must do</h3>

<p>You will still need to complete the passenger locator form and arrangements must be made for travel. You cannot use public transport to travel to your place of self-quarantine.</p>

<h2>Circumstances not covered by this guidance</h2>

<p>If you’re intending to travel to the UK in the next 14  days and are facing a set of circumstances that are not covered by this guidance, use the following email addresses for enquiries relating to:</p>
