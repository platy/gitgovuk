<h2>Supporting your medical and health conditions in managed quarantine</h2>

<h3>What to expect when entering a managed quarantine facility</h3>

<p>Managed quarantine is intended to help protect the UK from new and potentially harmful variants of coronavirus and is required when returning from a ‘Red List’ country only.</p>

<p>Whilst in managed quarantine, support is available to help you quarantine safely, and to make your stay as comfortable as possible. There is a package of medical and welfare support available to all guests, and emergency healthcare is available when necessary.</p>

<p>Unless there are exceptional circumstances, hotel staff will not be able to enter your room during your stay. Instead, disposable cleaning products will be available to you. If you have any concerns about maintaining the hygiene of your room during your stay (for example, due to mobility issues), please raise these concerns when you book your stay to ensure support is provided where applicable.</p>

<p>If you need support or care from a family member who has travelled with you, or is already in the UK, they should join you in managed quarantine.</p>

<p>See more information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managed-quarantine-what-to-expect/managed-quarantine-what-to-expect" class="govuk-link">what to expect when entering a managed quarantine facility</a>.</p>

<h3>Medical leave while in managed quarantine</h3>

<p>You can request permission to leave a managed quarantine facility (<abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr>) for a limited period of time.</p>

<p>These exceptional requests are different from requesting a medical exemption, as they would apply to a very limited period only, and in most cases would not permit an overnight stay outside the managed quarantine facility. An example of a situation where medical leave from an <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr> would be considered include, but is not confined to, attending a necessary medical appointment, which cannot be conducted remotely.</p>

<p>See more information on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/booking-and-staying-in-a-quarantine-hotel-when-you-arrive-in-england#staying-in-a-managed-quarantine-hotel" class="govuk-link">circumstances in which you can leave managed quarantine for medical reasons</a>.</p>

<h2>Medical exemptions from managed quarantine</h2>

<p>If quarantine in a managed quarantine facility (<abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr>) for 10 days would be severely detrimental to your health and the support available in an <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr> is insufficient to meet your medical or care needs, you can apply for an exemption from needing to enter a designated <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are granted a medical exemption, you will be expected to quarantine at home (or at your final destination) for the full 10 day quarantine period. You will also need to take a <a rel="external" href="https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/" class="govuk-link">PCR test on day 2 and day 8, booked through Corporate Travel Management</a> (<abbr title="Corporate Travel Management">CTM</abbr>).</p>

<p>Anyone else living at the same location as you must also quarantine for the full quarantine period, regardless of their vaccination status. They will not be required to take a day 2 or day 8 test, but we strongly advise all other members of the household to test themselves regularly. If they test positive at any point, they, you and the rest of your household will have to restart your 10 days of quarantine (the day the person took the positive test is the new day 0).</p>

<p>Read more about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-and-test-at-home-if-youve-been-in-a-red-list-country-and-have-permission-to-quarantine-at-home#checks-to-make-sure-youre-following-quarantine-rules" class="govuk-link">quarantine and testing requirements for you and your household if you have a medical exemption from a <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr> granted</a>.</p>

<p>These exemptions are detailed in the International Travel Regulations.</p>

<p>Exemptions from the requirement to quarantine in a <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr> are only granted in extremely limited circumstances. Only a very small minority of people with a pre-existing medical condition are likely to need an exemption from entering an <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are applying for such an exemption, you will need to provide medical evidence to support your request. This guidance includes details on the type of medical evidence, including from a suitably qualified or registered medical practitioner, that you must submit to support your application.</p>

<p>All medical exemption enquiries and requests must be emailed to: <a href="mailto:DHSCtesttrace.customerfeedbackteam@nhs.net" class="govuk-link">DHSCtesttrace.customerfeedbackteam@nhs.net</a>.</p>

<h3>Supplying evidence</h3>

<p>Evidence must be provided by a suitably qualified or registered medical practitioner of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your severe medical or health condition</li>
  <li>the support and/or care you reasonably need in the <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr> in order to manage your severe medical or health condition</li>
  <li>the probable impact to your health if you were required to quarantine in an <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr> and the necessary support was not provided</li>
</ul>

<p>The medical practitioner should consider whether additional medical support can be provided via telephone, or by a family member joining an individual in quarantine.</p>

<p>The medical practitioner should confirm that they have read and understood this guidance.</p>

<h3>What conditions must be met to qualify for an exemption</h3>

<p>An exemption will not be granted unless at least one of the following is true for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you have an existing severe medical or health condition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your medical condition requires you to have access to regular and/or ad hoc interventions (for example, medication, therapies, facilities, support) in order for you to support your recovery; remain stable and function normally; manage pain or mitigate the risk of you developing further medical conditions (including those relating to mental health).</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr> is unable to provide you with access to the support you need</li>
  <li>and your medical or health condition would be severely detrimentally impacted if you quarantined in an <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr> without this support</li>
  <li>and that support could be accessed in your place of quarantine</li>
</ul>

<p>The support available in managed quarantine facilities includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>medical support which can be provided by a registered medical practitioner by telephone</li>
  <li>support provided by a family member or carer who can join an individual during their quarantine period</li>
  <li>specific dietary requirements which can be provided within an <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>additional support provided for disabled guests, for example, rooms on lower floors, bed guards and regular welfare checks by suitably qualified professionals within the facility</li>
  <li>additional exercise requirements, which will be facilitated where possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who exemptions apply to</h3>

<p>Exemptions will only apply to the individual making the application. In cases of groups who travel together, an additional person who provides care to the individual who suffers from the medical condition may also be exempt if it allows them to continue to provide that care whilst quarantining at the alternative place of quarantine.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a child (someone who is under 18) and you are granted an exemption, the child will still be required to enter managed quarantine with another parent, guardian or appropriate adult who has travelled as part of your group.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a child and there is no other parent, guardian or appropriate adult in your group, your child may be eligible for an exemption from managed quarantine.</p>

<h3>How decisions are made</h3>

<p>Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, and an exemption may not be granted in advance of your arrival if you do not make a request in time.</p>

<p>Decisions will be communicated in writing. If you are granted a medical exemption, you will need to present evidence on arrival at the border that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have been granted an exemption from quarantine in an <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you have booked and paid for the day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 tests</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you are not granted an exemption</h3>

<p>If you are not granted a medical exemption you will be required to enter a managed quarantine facility upon arrival in the UK. If you are concerned about this, you may wish to delay your travel or take this into consideration when planning your travel.</p>

<p>If you decide to continue to travel and are required stay in an <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr>, and you require support during your stay, it is important that you communicate these requirements and/or medical conditions when you make your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/" rel="external">managed quarantine booking</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of medical conditions and/or requirements that should be stated prior to a visit include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a registered disability, for example, visual impairment</li>
  <li>needing a carer to stay in an adjoining room</li>
  <li>requiring a room equipped with disabled facilities, for example, walk-in showers</li>
  <li>specific dietary requirements, for example, due to a food allergy</li>
</ul>

<p>You may request an administrative review of a decision not to grant an exemption request, at any time, including during your stay in the <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr>. If you wish to request an administrative review, please email MQS at <a href="mailto:MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk</a> clearly indicating that you are requesting a review and provide a reason for why you think the initial decision was incorrect, as well as any additional evidence you might have. Please also include the reference number of your initial request.</p>

<h3>If you are granted an exemption</h3>

<p>If you are granted a medical exemption, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>quarantine at home or in the place you are staying for 10 days, (the day you arrive in England is day 0), or longer if you test positive for COVID-19</li>
  <li>provide the names of household members at the address where you intend to quarantine - everyone in the household in which you are quarantining must also isolate for the full quarantine period</li>
  <li>take a day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 test</li>
</ul>

<p>You must <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/">book a day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 testing package through <abbr title="Corporate Travel Management">CTM</abbr></a>. Select the option of ‘Exemption from Quarantine Hotel’.</p>

<p>When you receive your day 2 and day 8 test kits, you must email the 11-character test kit barcode to <a href="mailto:MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">MQS_new_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You will still need to complete the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">passenger locator form</a>. When you arrive in England, you must travel directly to the location you are going to quarantine at. You cannot use public transport to travel to your place of quarantine.</p>

<p>When quarantining in an alternative location, anyone else living in your household or the same location as you will also be required to quarantine for the full quarantine period, although they will not be required to take the day 2 and 8 tests. See more information on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-and-test-at-home-if-youve-been-in-a-red-list-country-and-have-permission-to-quarantine-at-home#checks-to-make-sure-youre-following-quarantine-rules" class="govuk-link">requirements when granted an exemption</a>.</p>

<h2>How and when to apply for an exemption</h2>

<p>You should finish and submit your application for an exemption at least 14 days ahead of travel so the evidence can be assessed, and a decision reached on your application.</p>

<p>If you do not apply for an exemption 14 days before travel, it may not be possible to consider it in advance of travel and in those circumstances, you will need to book and pay to enter an <abbr title="managed quarantine facility">MQF</abbr> on arrival.</p>

<p>Please be aware that more complex cases may take longer to consider.</p>

<p>To apply for an exemption, you must email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MQS_New_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk">MQS_New_Exemptions@dhsc.gov.uk</a> and provide the following details, in addition to your medical evidence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>names, dates of birth and addresses for those applying for an exemption</li>
  <li>planned travel dates</li>
  <li>current location (city and country) and which UK port of entry you wish to travel to</li>
  <li>reason for leaving the UK (please include dates)</li>
  <li>reason for travelling back to the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have sent your initial email, you will receive an automated response with a list of questions that you will need to answer and attach your medical evidence to (including information from your health care provider). Your responses are used to assess your application.</p>

<p>If you send multiple emails you risk delaying your application.</p>

<p>Please check your email junk or spam folder for responses.</p>
