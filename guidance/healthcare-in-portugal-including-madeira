<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>

<h2 id="brexit-healthcare">Healthcare in Portugal after Brexit</h2>

<p>You should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national living in or visiting Portugal.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Portugal in place.</p>

<p>If you are a current S1 form holder, a posted worker or student using a <a href="#ehic">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>, you should be ready for possible changes to how you access healthcare, if there is no deal and no alternative arrangements with Portugal in place.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-live-in-portugal">If you live in Portugal</h3>

<p>If you are a UK national living in Portugal and accessing healthcare based on your residence, your access to healthcare will not change when the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-portugal#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Portugal</a></li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Portugal</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<p>Access to healthcare in Portugal is residence-based, so residents will continue to access state healthcare after the UK leaves the EU. Once registered to live in Portugal, you can register with your local state-run health centre (centro de saúde) and get a healthcare user’s number (cartão de utente). Show this number whenever you need to access healthcare.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-portugal-after-brexit">Studying in Portugal after Brexit</h3>

<p>Portuguese <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/portugal-approves-no-deal-legislation-protecting-rights-of-uk-nationals">no-deal legislation</a> explains that if there is a no-deal Brexit, you can access necessary medical care in Portugal by presenting a valid UK passport. The <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> would no longer be accepted.</p>

<p>If your course started before Brexit, the <a href="#help-with-payments">UK can help with medical treatment you need that you’re being asked to pay for</a>.</p>

<h3 id="help-with-payments">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free if you live in Portugal and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>If you are living in Portugal before exit day, you may use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge after exit day if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>This will remain the case after exit day.</p>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="ehic">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Portuguese authorities have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/portugal-approves-no-deal-legislation-protecting-rights-of-uk-nationals">published legislation</a> that explains that UK nationals who are temporarily staying in Portugal maintain the right to access healthcare in the National Health Service (SNS), if they present a valid UK passport. The <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> would no longer be accepted. These measures would remain in place until the end of 2020 or until a further arrangement is reached with the Portuguese authorities.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Portugal.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need. If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, the <a href="#help-with-payments">UK can help if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it</a>.</p>

<p>The healthcare system in Portugal consists of a National Health Service (Serviço Nacional de Saúde, SNS), a social security scheme, and voluntary private health insurance.</p>

<p>You’ll be entitled to state-run healthcare on the same basis as a Portuguese national if you’re going to work in Portugal and make national insurance contributions.</p>

<p>You must be working or be a dependant of someone who’s working in Portugal to get a Portuguese Social Security number (<abbr title="Portuguese Social Security number">NISS</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you are registered with Portuguese Social Security, you should apply for a Portuguese-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for visits outside of Portugal to another EU country, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland. Your Portuguese-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid in the UK until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You should also buy comprehensive travel insurance to cover anything not covered by your Portuguese <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or for travel to countries outside the EU.</p>

<h3 id="uk-posted-workers">UK posted workers</h3>

<p>If you’re a worker posted to Portugal by a UK company, you may be entitled to health cover funded by the UK.</p>

<p>You can find out more from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):</p>

<p>If you’re legally resident in Portugal, you can register with your local state-run health centre (centro de saúde) and get a healthcare user’s number (cartão de utente). Show this number whenever you need to access healthcare.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Portugal and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Portugal. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. If you are eligible for an S1 certificate, you should apply now. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you are a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You may be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> does not cover you for private treatment so you will need to make sure you are treated by a state healthcare provider.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>If you have a pre-existing health condition, you should buy medical travel insurance before you visit Portugal. You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medication with you.</p>

<p>You’ll need to be referred by a doctor for any specialist hospital treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you’re referred to a state hospital as only these provide treatment with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. However, you may still have to make a small contribution. This is known as moderating fees (taxa moderadora).</p>
