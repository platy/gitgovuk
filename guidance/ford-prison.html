<h2>Book and plan your visit to Ford</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>HMP Ford is offering visits for family and friends. Visiting times and availability may change at short notice. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact the prison direct for any queries</a>.</p>

<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Ford</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

<h3>Help with the cost of your visit</h3>

</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a visitor car park with Blue Badge spaces available.</p>

<h3>Entering Ford</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Ford has a strictly family-focused, dress code policy. This means visitors should wear smart clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Ford. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There is a visitor centre available, however there will be no refeshments available during your visit.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days taking place.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Ford</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Ford.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>
<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you, after they have finished work. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Ford using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from prisoners, depending on the rules at Ford.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Ford</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Ford does not accept gifts or parcels through the post.
Prisoners can order items through a catalogue.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<h2>Life at Ford</h2>
<p>Ford is an open prison committed to providing a safe and educational environment. 
Ford prisoners all have under 2 years left to serve on their sentence so the focus is on resettlement and on men learning new skills to help them on release.</p>

<h3>Security and safeguarding</h3>
<p>Every person at Ford has a right to feel safe. The staff are responsible for their safeguarding and welfare at all times.</p>

<p>For further information about what to do when you are worried or concerned about someone in prison <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/pages/category/need-urgent-help?Take=24" rel="external">visit the Prisoners’ Families helpline website</a>.</p>

<p>All safeguarding processes are overseen by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.westsussexsab.org.uk/" rel="external">West Sussex Safeguarding Adults Board</a>.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>
<p>When a prisoner first arrives at Ford, they will be able to contact a family member by phone. This could be quite late in the evening, depending on the time they arrive.</p>

<p>They will get to speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>
<p>Each person who arrives at Ford gets an induction that lasts about a week. They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Prisoners find out about the rules, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work. On arrival, prisoners share a room.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Ford Prison holds over 500 men in mixed accommodation of single and double rooms.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>
<p>All prisoners are expected to work as they would out in the community.
Work opportunities inside prison include painting and decorating, carpentry, engineering, cleaning and call centre work.
Work outside the prison is either supported through community service placements, work experience or paid work.</p>

<p>There is a wide range of courses that lead to vocational and academic qualifications, both inside and outside Ford.</p>

<p>The prison’s <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/secure-environments/overview/virtual-campus" rel="external">virtual campus</a> is open every day from 8am to 8pm.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>
<p>Prisoners are eligible for release on temporary licence (ROTL) once they’ve been approved by the Prisons Risk Assessment Board.</p>

<p>This assessment involves working and talking to external providers. These include the police, offender managers and any other official party associated with the care and welfare of the prisoner and others involved in the ROTL. Each prisoner is different but they are generally approved after 12 weeks at Ford.</p>

<p>All changes to personal circumstances will be reviewed by the Board.</p>

<h3>Organisations Ford works with</h3>
<p>Ford works with many groups that offer support to prisoners.</p>

<p>These include <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.relate.org.uk/" rel="external">Relate</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.samaritans.org/" rel="external">Samaritans</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.scope.org.uk" rel="external">Scope</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/" rel="external">The Salvation Army</a> and veteran support groups.</p>
