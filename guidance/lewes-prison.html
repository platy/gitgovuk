<h2>Book and plan your visit to Lewes</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Lewes you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit at least 24 hours in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-lewes">required ID</a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit.
Prisoners on remand (pending trial) can have 2 visits a week. Convicted prisoners (already sentenced) can have 2 visits a month, plus one extra, depending on privileges.
You can only visit once on weekends.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Lewes</a> if you have more questions about visiting.</p>

<h3>Help with the cost of your visit</h3>
<p>If you get certain benefits or have an NHS health certificate, you might be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help-with-prison-visits">get help with the costs of your visit</a>, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travel to Lewes</li>
  <li>somewhere to stay overnight</li>
  <li>meals</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to book family and friends visits</h3>
<p>Lewes is running a limited visits schedule. Visits are also happening differently than normal, observing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic">strict guidelines, which must be followed</a>.</p>

<p>You can book your visit by telephone or you can also register to use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/berwyn-prison#secure-video-calls">secure video calls</a> service. There is no online booking service available.</p>

<p>You must arrive at least 30 minutes before your visit to allow for security and processing.</p>

<p>Booking line: 01273 785 277 or 01273 785 271
The booking line is open everyday, 8am to 5pm

</ul>

<p>Only Blue Badge holders can park at the prison. There are 2 spaces next to the visitors centre. Tell the prison staff you are parking here, show them your Blue Badge and give them your vehicle registration number. Visitors centre staff can help you with this.</p>

<p>There is metered parking on the roads outside the prison.</p>

<h3>Entering Lewes</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Lewes has a dress code policy, which means visitors should wear family-friendly clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Lewes. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spurgeons.org/" rel="external">Spurgeons</a> runs the visitors centre with toys and art materials and a small play area for children. There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>If you have a disability, let the prison know and they will make sure your visit is on the lower level.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days being run.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Lewes</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Lewes.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms but they will always have to call you. They buy phone credits to do this and can call anytime between 6am and midnight.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Lewes using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope. If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Lewes</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Each week, prisoners can send 2 second class letters and one first class legal letter.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>You can not bring anything with you for the person you are visiting unless they have already applied for that item to be brought in. This application must be completed within the first 28 days of arrival in prison, and at least 3 days ahead of your visit.</p>

<p>You can hand in items at the prison anytime between Monday and Friday, during normal visit times.</p>

<p>Family and friends of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers. The ‘facilities list’ tells you what is allowed in parcels and is available in the visitors centre.</p>

<p>After the first 28 days, additional items must be ordered by the prisoner from a catalogue.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>

<p>It also works with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forwardtrust.org.uk/" rel="external">The Forward Trust</a>, which offers help around substance misuse and delivers a number of ‘family ties workshops’. This is in partnership with Care UK and can offer detoxification, if necessary.</p>
