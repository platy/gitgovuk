<p>What you must do when you enter England from abroad depends on whether you’re fully vaccinated under an approved vaccination programme. Some people qualify for fully vaccinated rules for different reasons.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h2>New rules for fully vaccinated arrivals</h2>

<p>If you are fully vaccinated and arrive in England from a country that is not on the red list, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must quarantine at home or in the place you’re staying</li>
  <li>take a PCR test before the end of day 2 after you arrive (lateral flow tests will not be accepted)</li>
  <li>can end quarantine if your PCR test result is negative or 14 days have passed, whichever is first</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the guidance on this page to find out how long you must quarantine for after you arrive, and what you can and cannot do in quarantine.</p>

<p>From 4am on Tuesday 7 December, there are also new rules on pre-departure testing before you travel to England. For more information, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Travel to England from another country during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<h2>If you’ve been in a red list country</h2>

<p>There are different rules if you’ve been in a red list country in the 10 days before you arrive in England.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">Check which countries and territories are on the red list and read the red list rules</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for people who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have not been in a country on the red list in the 10 days before arriving in England</li>
  <li>must quarantine at home or in the place they’re staying after international travel</li>
</ul>

<h2>How long you must quarantine for</h2>

<h3>If you’re fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>If you’re fully vaccinated you must take a COVID-19 PCR test on or before day 2 after you arrive in England.
If the test result is negative, you can end your quarantine immediately.</p>

<p>If your test result is positive, you must self-isolate for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>If your test result is unclear, you must self-isolate for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0. 
You can choose to take another private PCR test. If the result is negative, you can stop self-isolating.</p>

<p>If your test result is delayed, you must quarantine until you receive a negative test result or until day 14 after arrival, whichever is sooner.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>If you’re in England for less than 2 days, you must quarantine until you receive a negative day 2 COVID-19 PCR test result, or until you leave England, whichever is sooner.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you are not fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>You must quarantine for 10 full days.</p>

<p>The quarantine period is continuous from the day you arrive in England, and lasts for the next 10 full days after the day you arrived until 11:59pm on day 10. This period is necessary because it can take up to 10 days for COVID-19 symptoms to appear.</p>

<p>To count the days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the day you arrive in England is day 0</li>
  <li>the day after you arrive is day 1, and so on</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you’re travelling to England for less than 10 days, you will need to quarantine for the whole of your stay. You must still <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">book and pay for your day 2 and day 8 travel tests</a>, even if you will no longer be in England on the dates of the tests. You only need to take the tests if you’re still in England on those dates.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to travel to the place where you’re quarantining</h2>

<p>When you arrive in England, go straight to the place you’re staying to quarantine. Only use public transport if you have no other option, and make sure you follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">safer travel guidance for passengers</a>.</p>

<h4>If you have or develop COVID-19 symptoms</h4>

<p>If you have COVID-19 symptoms, it’s important that you do not travel by public transport.</p>

<p>If you develop COVID-19 symptoms when you’re travelling to England, you should tell one of the crew on your plane, boat, train or bus. They’ll let staff in the airport, port or station know, so they can tell you what you should do next when you arrive.</p>

<h4>Long journeys to your quarantine accommodation</h4>

<p>If you have a long journey within the UK to arrive at the place where you’ll be quarantining, you may be able to stop overnight in accommodation where you can quarantine yourself from others before continuing your journey.</p>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">follow the guidance on how to stay safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>. You must quarantine and provide the address of your overnight stop on your passenger locator form in addition to your declared accommodation address.</p>

<h2>What you can and cannot do in quarantine</h2>

<p>You must quarantine at the address you provided on the passenger locator form. This can include staying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in your own home</li>
  <li>with friends or family</li>
  <li>in a standard hotel or other temporary accommodation</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not have to quarantine in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/booking-and-staying-in-a-quarantine-hotel-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">managed quarantine hotel</a> – these are only for people arriving from countries on the red list.</p>

<p>You must quarantine in one place for the full quarantine period, where you can have food and other necessities delivered.</p>

<h3>Quarantining safely</h3>

<p>As soon as you arrive at your place of quarantine you should, as far as possible, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">avoid contact with other people in the place where you’re quarantining</a> to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>You should stay in a well ventilated room with an outside window that can be opened, separate from other people in your home.</p>

<p>If you’re staying in a hotel or guest house, you must stay away from others who did not travel with you. You must not use shared areas such as bars, restaurants, health clubs and sports facilities.</p>

<p>Stay 2 metres apart from other people staying there at all times.</p>

<h3>Visitors</h3>
<p>You cannot have visitors, including friends and family, unless they’re providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>emergency assistance</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-providing-unpaid-care">care or assistance, including personal care</a></li>
  <li>medical assistance</li>
  <li>veterinary services</li>
  <li>certain critical public services</li>
</ul>

<h3>Going out</h3>

<p>Unless you’re at risk of harm, you cannot leave the premises where you’re in quarantine. You must only exercise inside the place where you’re quarantining or in the garden. You cannot leave to walk your dog. You will need to ask friends or relatives to help you with this.</p>

<h3>If you’re at risk of  harm</h3>

<p>If you’re at risk of harm (for example, in cases of domestic abuse), you can leave the place where you’re quarantining.</p>

<h3>Shopping</h3>

<p>You must not go shopping. If you need help buying groceries, other shopping or picking up medication, you should ask friends or relatives or order a delivery or ask for help from <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/services">NHS Volunteer Responders</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting or posting your tests</h3>

<p>Where your testing provider conducts the day 2 and day 8 tests at a test site you can leave the house for your test. Where your tests are delivered and self-administered, if there is no one in your household or bubble who can post the test for processing, you can leave the premises to post your test.</p>

<p>If you have to leave the premises, you should follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">safer travel guidance</a> and avoid public transport if possible.</p>

<h3>Exceptional circumstances</h3>

<p>You can leave your accommodation in certain exceptional circumstances. This includes needing to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get basic urgent necessities like food and medicines where you cannot arrange for these to be delivered</li>
  <li>travel to a COVID-19 testing site</li>
  <li>access critical public services including social services and services provided to victims (such as victims of crime)</li>
  <li>move to a different place for quarantine where you can no longer remain where you are</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be other exceptional circumstances that allow you to leave your place of quarantine.</p>

<p>You can get advice from a medical or other professional to help decide whether your circumstances are exceptional and require you to leave your place of quarantine.</p>

<h3>What to do if you get COVID-19 symptoms</h3>

<p>You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">order a test</a> if you develop at least one of these 3 COVID-19 symptoms at any point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>you’ve lost your sense of smell or taste or it’s changed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules for the people you’re staying with</h2>

<p>The people you’re staying with do not need to quarantine, unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they travelled with you</li>
  <li>you or someone in the place where you’re staying develop symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>you get a positive test result for your day 2 or day 8 test</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these things apply, your household must quarantine with you, following the same rules and for the same length of time as you.</p>

<h2>Ending quarantine</h2>

<p>You may leave the place where you’re quarantining after 10 full days (where day 0 is the day you took the test or had symptoms). You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have received a negative result to both your day 2 and day 8 tests</li>
  <li>not have any COVID-19 symptoms</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ending quarantine early using Test to Release</h3>

<p>Under the Test to Release scheme you can choose to pay for a private COVID-19 test on day 5. If the result is negative (and the result of your day 2 test was negative or inconclusive), you can end your quarantine.</p>

<p>You do not have to do this – it’s a voluntary test.</p>

<p>You must still book and take your mandatory day 2 and day 8 travel tests, even if your Test to Release result is negative.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel">Find out more about Test to Release</a>, including a link to providers offering this test.</p>

<h2>Checks to make sure you’re following quarantine rules</h2>

<p>While you quarantine, NHS Test and Trace will contact you daily to confirm you’re following quarantine rules. You may also be visited by staff carrying out in-person checks on behalf of Test and Trace to make sure you’re complying with your legal duty to quarantine. Read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/self-isolation-compliance-checks-after-international-travel">checks carried out to make sure you’re following quarantine rules</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" role="note" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>If you break the quarantine rules, you may face a penalty of up to £10,000.</p>
</div>

<h2>Support to help you quarantine</h2>

<p>Quarantining may be difficult, frustrating or lonely. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/services" rel="external">NHS Volunteer Responders</a> are available if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you need help collecting shopping or medication</li>
  <li>you’d like a friendly chat</li>
</ul>

<p>Call 0808 196 3646 (8am to 8pm) to arrange support. You can arrange one-off support, or schedule more regular help while you’re quarantining.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/coronavirus/" class="govuk-link">get help looking after your mental health</a>.</p>

<h2>Changing the place where you’re quarantining</h2>

<p>You are not allowed to change the place where you’re quarantining except in very limited circumstances, including where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a legal obligation requires you to change address, such as when you’re a child whose parents live separately, and you need to move between homes as part of a shared custody agreement</li>
  <li>it’s necessary and permissible for you to stay overnight at accommodation before travelling to the place where you will be quarantining for the remaining period</li>
</ul>

<p>If this happens, you must provide full details of each address where you will quarantine on the passenger locator form. If, in exceptional circumstances, you cannot remain where you’re staying, you can move to a new place to quarantine and you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">complete a new passenger locator form</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Circumstances not covered by this guidance</h2>

<p>If you’re intending to travel to the UK in the next 7 days and facing a set of circumstances that are not covered by this guidance, email your enquiry to <a href="mailto:dhsctesttrace.customerfeedbackteam@nhs.net" class="govuk-link">dhsctesttrace.customerfeedbackteam@nhs.net</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you include your date of travel.</p>
