<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for people arriving in England from abroad who do not qualify as fully vaccinated under the rules for travel to England and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get a positive or unclear result in their arrival <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>do not take an arrival <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">Read the rules on travel to England from another country during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination">Check if you qualify as fully vaccinated</a></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>There are different rules if you have been in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">red list country or territory</a> in the 10 days before you arrive in England. There are currently no countries or territories on the red list.</p>
</div>

<h2>When you arrive in England – not fully vaccinated</h2>

<p>You do not need to quarantine when you arrive in England.</p>

<p>You must take the COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test that you booked before you travelled.</p>

<p>You can take the test any time after you arrive and before the end of day 2 at the latest. The day you arrive in England is day 0.</p>

<p>If the test result is positive or unclear, you must self-isolate.</p>

<p>If you do not take the test, you must self-isolate.</p>

<h3>Positive test result</h3>

<p>If your test result is positive, you must self-isolate immediately. The standard self-isolation period is 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>You can stop self-isolating on day 6 if you do a rapid lateral flow test on days 5 and 6 of your self-isolation period and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you do the tests at least 24 hours apart</li>
  <li>both tests are negative</li>
  <li>you do not have a high temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>For further information, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/how-long-to-self-isolate/" rel="external">NHS guidance on how long to self-isolate</a>.</p>

<h3>Unclear test result</h3>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is unclear, you must self-isolate for 10 full days. The day you took the test is day 0.</p>

<p>You can choose to take another private test. If the result of that test is negative, you can stop self-isolating. If the result is positive, you must follow the rules for a positive test result.</p>

<h3>If you do not take the test</h3>

<p>If you do not take the test, you must self-isolate for 14 full days from the day after you arrive in England.</p>

<h2>Where to self-isolate</h2>

<p>If you need to self-isolate, you must do so at the address you provided on your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">passenger locator form</a>. This can include staying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in your own home</li>
  <li>with friends or family</li>
  <li>in a hotel or other temporary accommodation</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to self-isolate</h2>

<p>The following rules apply on what you can and cannot do if you have to self-isolate after testing positive in your arrival test, get an unclear test result or do not take the test.</p>

<p>You should, as far as possible, avoid contact with other people in the place where you’re self-isolating to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>You should stay in a well ventilated room with an outside window that can be opened, separate from other people in your home.</p>

<p>If you’re staying in a hotel or guest house, you must stay away from others who did not travel with you. You must not use shared areas such as bars, restaurants, health clubs and sports facilities.</p>

<p>Stay 2 metres apart from other people staying there at all times.</p>

<p>You are not allowed to change the place where you’re self-isolating except in very limited circumstances, including where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a legal obligation requires you to change address, such as when you’re a child whose parents live separately, and you need to move between homes as part of a shared custody agreement</li>
  <li>it’s necessary and permissible for you to stay overnight at accommodation before travelling to the place where you will be self-isolating for the remaining period</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visitors</h3>

<p>You cannot have visitors, including friends and family, unless they’re providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>emergency assistance</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-providing-unpaid-care">care or assistance, including personal care</a></li>
  <li>medical assistance</li>
  <li>veterinary services</li>
  <li>certain critical public services</li>
</ul>

<h3>Going out</h3>

<p>Unless you’re at risk of harm, you cannot leave the premises. You must only exercise inside the place where you’re self-isolating, or in the garden. You cannot leave to walk your dog. You will need to ask friends or relatives to help you with this.</p>

<h3>If you’re at risk of harm</h3>

<p>If you’re at risk of harm (for example, in cases of domestic abuse), you can leave the place where you’re self-isolating.</p>

<h3>Shopping</h3>

<p>You must not go shopping. If you need help buying groceries, other shopping or picking up medication, you should ask friends or relatives or order a delivery or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/services" rel="external">ask for help from NHS Volunteer Responders</a>.</p>

<h3>Exceptional circumstances</h3>

<p>You can leave your accommodation in certain exceptional circumstances. This includes needing to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get basic urgent necessities like food and medicines where you cannot arrange for these to be delivered</li>
  <li>travel to a COVID-19 testing site</li>
  <li>access critical public services including social services and services provided to victims (such as victims of crime)</li>
  <li>move to a different place where you can no longer remain where you are</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be other exceptional circumstances that allow you to leave your place of self-isolation.</p>

<p>You can get advice from a medical or other professional to help decide whether your circumstances are exceptional and require you to leave your place of self-isolation.</p>

<h3>Rules for the people you’re staying with</h3>

<p>The people you’re staying with do not need to self-isolate, unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are not fully vaccinated</li>
  <li>they develop any of the symptoms of COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these things apply, they must self-isolate with you.</p>

<h3>Getting help and support</h3>

<p>Self-isolating may be difficult, frustrating or lonely. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/services" rel="external">NHS Volunteer Responders</a> are available if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you need help collecting shopping or medication</li>
  <li>you’d like a friendly chat</li>
</ul>

<p>Call 0808 196 3646 (8am to 8pm) to arrange support. You can arrange one-off support, or schedule more regular help while you’re quarantining.</p>

<p>You can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/coronavirus/" rel="external">get help looking after your mental health</a>.</p>

<h2>Checks to make sure you’re following self-isolation rules</h2>

<p>While you self-isolate, NHS Test and Trace may contact you daily to confirm you’re following self-isolation rules. You may also be visited by staff carrying out in-person checks on behalf of Test and Trace to make sure you’re complying with your legal duty to self-isolate.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you break the self-isolation rules, you may face a penalty of up to £10,000.</p>
</div>

<h2>Circumstances not covered by this guidance</h2>

<p>If you’re intending to travel to the UK in the next 7 days and are facing a set of circumstances not covered by this guidance you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://enquiries.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/s/enquiries" rel="external">get help with coronavirus (COVID-19) enquiries and complaints</a> or contact 119.</p>
