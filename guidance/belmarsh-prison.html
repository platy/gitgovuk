<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Belmarsh</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Belmarsh.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

  <li>Tuesday to Thursday: 11:30am to 12:00pm, 4:30pm to 5pm</li>
  <li>Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: Closed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms but will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this. The phones are inactive after 10pm, but available at many times during the day.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call. This can take longer depending on individual cases.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
