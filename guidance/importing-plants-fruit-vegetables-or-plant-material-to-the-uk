<h2 id="categories-of-material">Categories of material</h2>

<p>Plants, fruit, vegetables and plant material (like soil) from outside the EU fall into 3 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘unrestricted’ material you can bring to the UK without any conditions</li>
  <li>‘controlled’ material that you can only bring into the UK with a ‘phytosanitary certificate’ to show it meets the requirements for entry to the EU</li>
  <li>‘prohibited’ material you can’t bring into the UK unless you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-prohibited-plants-plant-pests-pathogens-and-soil">get a scientific research licence</a> or an exception (‘derogation’) to the rules - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency</a> (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) if you want to apply for a derogation</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of this guide explains how to import controlled material that requires a phytosanitary certificate.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/issuing-plant-passports-to-trade-plants-in-the-eu">send or receive plants within the EU</a> and how to export plants to non-EU countries.</p>

<h2 id="material-thats-controlled">Material that’s controlled</h2>

<p>Controlled plants, fruit, vegetables and plant material include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all plants for planting</li>
  <li>common fruits (except for bananas and grapes) other than fruit preserved by deep freezing</li>
  <li>cut flowers</li>
  <li>some seeds and leafy vegetables other than vegetables preserved by deep freezing</li>
  <li>potatoes from some countries</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re not sure whether the item you want to bring to the UK is controlled, check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-species-by-import-category">list of plant species by import category</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2 id="personal-allowance">Personal allowance</h2>

<p>There is a concession from the requirements relating to controlled material that, subject to certain provisions, permits the import of small quantities of plant produce and up to a total of 5 controlled plants without a phytosanitary certificate from certain countries provided that the material is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in your personal baggage</li>
  <li>for your personal use</li>
  <li>not diseased or infected with pests</li>
</ul>

<p>Further details can be found in the Border Force Leaflet <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/531618/Bringing_fruit__veg_and_plants_into_the_UK_leaflet.pdf">Bringing fruit, vegetables and plant products into the UK</a>. Otherwise you must follow the procedures in this guide.</p>

<h2 id="register-as-an-importer">Register as an importer</h2>

<p>You must follow the Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural marketing inspectorate (<abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate">PEACH</abbr>).</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Module=Register">Register for <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate">PEACH</abbr></a> before you start importing plants.</p>

<p>Once you’re registered you can follow the progress of your consignments through inspections and other checks on the <a rel="external" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/"><abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate">PEACH</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="phytosanitary-certificates">Phytosanitary certificates</h2>

<p>You must get a phytosanitary certificate for each consignment of controlled plants, fruit, vegetables or plant material that you import, from the plant health authority in the country where your supplier is.</p>

<p>The certificate is a statement from the plant health authority that the consignment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been officially inspected</li>
  <li>complies with legal requirements for entry into the EU</li>
  <li>is free from serious pests and diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>The inspection referred to in the certificate must take place no more than 14 days before the consignment is dispatched from the inspecting country. The certificate must be signed by someone in the inspecting plant health authority within the same 14 day period.</p>

<p>If your consignment includes plants from more than one country, you’ll need to get a separate phytosanitary certificate from the plant health authority in each country.</p>

<h3 id="quantity">Quantity</h3>

<p>Phytosanitary certificates include a ‘quantity declared’ section. Tell the plant health authority that’s completing the form to fill in quantities as follows.</p>

<p>For cut flowers quantity must be stated as the number of stems.</p>

<p>Quantities must be stated in kilograms (kg) for fruit, vegetables, soil and branches with foliage, potatoes, grain and the following plants for planting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bulbs</li>
  <li>corms and rhizomes</li>
  <li>plants in tissue culture</li>
  <li>seeds</li>
</ul>

<p>For any other plants for planting, the quantity must be recorded as the number of items in the consignment.</p>

<p>It’s up to you to make sure quantities are stated in this way. The plant health authority may use quantity measures for consignments bound for other countries, so you will need to tell them about the measures required for UK-bound consignments.</p>

<h2 id="pre-arrival-notification">Pre-arrival notification</h2>

<p>You must use the <a rel="external" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/"><abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate">PEACH</abbr> website</a> to give advance notice each time you bring a consignment to the UK.</p>

<p>You must give:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the case of any relevant material brought by air, at least 4 working hours before the relevant material is landed</li>
  <li>in any other case, at least 3 working days before the relevant material is landed</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also scan the following documents and upload them to the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate">PEACH</abbr> website before your consignment arrives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the phytosanitary certificate for the consignment</li>
  <li>the travel ticket if you’re travelling with the plants yourself</li>
  <li>bill of lading, cargo movement request or delivery company invoice if you’re not travelling with the plants</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/importing-plant-material-record-of-details">form you must complete to record details of your imported plant material</a> - this applies to plant material for planting</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inspections">Inspections</h2>

<p>When it arrives in the UK, your consignment must be presented for inspection to check it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>includes all required documents</li>
  <li>contains the plants you have said it does</li>
  <li>is free from pests and diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>If your consignment doesn’t pass an inspection it may be destroyed, treated, or sent back to where you sent it from at your expense.</p>

<h2 id="eel-decline">Inspection fees</h2>

<p>For each consignment imported you have to pay the following fees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A fee of £9.71 for each consignment to cover the cost of checking the consignment’s paperwork and identity.</li>
  <li>A physical inspection fee - the amount you will have to pay will depend on the type of plant material you’re importing.</li>
</ul>

<p>See Schedule 1 of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/289/pdfs/uksi_20180289_en.pdf">Plant Health etc. (Fees) (England) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reduced-inspection-fees">Reduced inspection fees</h3>

<p>Some plant material, imported from particular countries, is eligible for a reduced level of physical inspection. This many mean a lower inspection fee.</p>

<p>Check schedule 2 of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/289/pdfs/uksi_20180289_en.pdf">Plant Health etc. (Fees) (England) Regulations 2018</a> to find out if your consignment qualifies for a lower inspection fee.</p>

<h2 id="points-of-entry">Points of entry</h2>

<p>You can use these <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-imports-authorised-points-of-entry-to-the-uk">designated points of entry</a> to bring your consignment into the UK.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to select the point of entry you want to use from a drop down list on the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate">PEACH</abbr> website.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-present-certificates">How to present certificates</h2>

<p>If you’re travelling with your consignment, you can provide phytosanitary and reforwarding certificates for inspection yourself when you arrive in the UK.</p>

<p>If you’re shipping the consignment by post, put the certificates in an envelope marked ‘For the attention of Border Force’ and attach it to the outside of your package.</p>

<p>If you have more than one package, attach certified copies of the certificates to each package. A certified copy is a copy signed by the plant health authority that drew up the certificate.</p>

<h2 id="submit-documents-after-your-consignment-arrives">Submit documents after your consignment arrives</h2>

<p>Within 3 days of your consignment reaching the UK, you must post the original phytosanitary certificate to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>

<p>For consignments landing at Heathrow or Gatwick send the certificate to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Animal and Plant Health Agency    
<br></br>1st floor
<br></br>Building 4
<br></br>Heathrow Boulevard
<br></br>284 Bath Road
<br></br>West Drayton
<br></br>Middlesex
<br></br>UB7 0DQ   
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<p>For consignments landing anywhere else send the certificate to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<br></br>Room 11GA02 
<br></br>Sand Hutton

<br></br>YO41 1LZ
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<h3 id="consignments-travelling-through-another-eu-state">Consignments travelling through another EU state</h3>

<p>If your consignment travelled through another EU member state, the plant health authority in the other member state will have taken the phytosanitary certificate and replaced it with a ‘plant health movement document’.</p>

<p>In this case, send the plant health movement document to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> instead.</p>

<h2 id="complaints-and-appeals">Complaints and appeals</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/complaints-procedure">complain or appeal</a> if you’re unsatisfied with the service you receive from <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>
