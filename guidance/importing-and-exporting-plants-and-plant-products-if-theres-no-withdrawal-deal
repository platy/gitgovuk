<p>‘Plant’ means a living plant (including a fungus or tree) or a living part of a plant (including a living part of a fungus or shrub), at any stage of growth.</p>

<p>‘Plant product’ means products of plant origin, unprocessed or having undergone simple preparation, in so far as these are not plants, including wood and bark.</p>

<h2 id="importing-plants-and-plant-products-from-the-eu">Importing plants and plant products from the EU</h2>
<p>The majority of plants and plant products (including fruit, vegetables and cut flowers) imported from the EU will continue to enter the UK freely, as currently.</p>

<p>After the UK leaves the EU, any plants and plant products currently managed under the EU plant passport scheme will be subject to UK import controls and become ‘regulated commodities’. This replaces the EU plant passport’s assurance and traceability, and maintains biosecurity.</p>

<p>When you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/issuing-plant-passports-to-trade-plants-in-the-eu#when-you-need-a-plant-passport">import plants or plant products that are currently managed under the EU plant passport scheme</a>, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register as an importer using the <a rel="external" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/">Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate (PEACH) website</a> for regulated plants and plant products entering the UK via England and Wales</li>
  <li>make sure a regulated consignment enters the UK with a phytosanitary certificate (<abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr>) issued in the country of export (or re-export)</li>
  <li>provide pre-arrival notification using the PEACH website - as part of this you will need to upload scanned copies of your <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr> and other relevant documents (for example bill of lading, cargo movement request, or delivery company invoice) to the PEACH website</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk#how-to-present-certificates">supply the original copy of the <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr> by post</a> within 3 days of your consignment arriving in the UK</li>
  <li>if you are entering goods directly into <a rel="external" href="https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing">Scotland</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/topics/plant-and-tree-health">Northern Ireland</a>, refer to the relevant plant health authority for further information.</li>

<h3 id="notice-periods-for-imports-originating-in-the-eu-that-require-a-phytosanitary-certificate-regulated-commodities">Notice periods for imports originating in the EU that require a phytosanitary certificate: regulated commodities</h3>
<p>You must notify the relevant plant health authority of a consignment’s arrival into the UK from the EU. There is no set notice period - you can give notice at any time up to the point that the consignment enters the UK.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-find-your-relevant-plant-health-authority">How to find your relevant plant health authority</h3>

<p>Give notice by informing the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk">relevant plant health authority</a> on the PEACH website for England and Wales.</p>

<p>Importers in <a rel="external" href="https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing">Scotland</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/topics/plant-and-tree-health">Northern Ireland</a> use their own plant health authorities.</p>

<h3 id="how-border-checks-will-be-carried-out">How border checks will be carried out</h3>

<p>Regulated plants and plant products originating in the EU will not be stopped at the border.</p>

<p>The relevant <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk#eel-decline">UK plant health authority</a> will carry out their documentary and identity checks remotely. This will be a virtual check using the documents submitted as part of the pre-notification and will not require the goods to stop inland.  These checks will be charged for by the plant health authority. You will also be charged for any <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-wood-wood-products-or-bark-from-non-eu-countries#inspection-fees">Forestry Commission checks</a>.</p>

<p>Plant health inspectors will continue to carry out follow-up surveillance and inspections inland in line with current policies. The government does not charge for such inspections.</p>

<h3 id="steps-to-take-now-to-prepare-for-eu-exit">Steps to take now to prepare for EU Exit</h3>
<p>You can prepare by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reading the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk">importing plants and plant products into the UK from third countries</a>
</li>

<p>Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk">import plants, fruit, vegetables and plant materials to the UK from third countries</a> and how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/importing-and-exporting-wood-and-timber-products">import and export wood and timber products</a> using the current rules.</p>

<p>In a no deal scenario, the EU would no longer be obliged to carry out plant health checks on regulated third- country goods going to the UK.</p>

<p>Plants and plant products that come from third countries via the EU without plant health checks by an EU member state, will be treated as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk">third-country imports</a>.</p>

<p>Many plants and plant products entering the UK via the EU arrive at fast-moving roll-on roll-off (<abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr>) ports where checks at the border would create significant disruptions to traffic. All third-country plant health regulated material arriving in the UK via <abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> ports requiring checks will have to go to a plant health approved facility for inspection.</p>

<p>These facilities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place of First Arrival (<abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr>) - trade premises that have been authorised to host plant health controls on third country material entering the UK via the EU at <abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> ports</li>
  <li>other facilities that have been authorised for Plant Health control (‘alternative inspection posts’)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must ensure that plant health checks are carried out on third-country material entering the UK via the EU by doing one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/approval-of-premises-as-place-of-first-arrival-application">registering a place of first arrival (<abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr>)</a></li>
  <li>using a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk#points-of-entry">non-<abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> point of entry</a> where checks can take place at the border</li>
  <li>using an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk#alternative-inspection-posts">‘alternative inspection post’</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Checks on third country plant health material will be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk#inspection-fees">charged for</a> by the relevant plant health authority.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-register-as-a-place-of-first-arrival">How to register as a place of first arrival</h2>

<p>You may need to speak to suppliers about whether the plants and plant products they import from third countries are likely to move to the UK via the EU. Consider whether to apply for <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> status before 12 April 2019.</p>

<p>To import third-country material that need plant health checks in the UK via <abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> ports, you’ll need to have access to a <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr>. You can register your own <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reading the <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> standards and take any necessary steps to ensure your premises meet the requirements</li>
  <li>applying to be authorised by the relevant plant health authority - you’ll need to complete the relevant <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> form for plant and plant products or for wood and timber products.</li>
</ul>

<p>To bring in material for checks at an authorised <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr>, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> standards and take any necessary steps to ensure your premises meet the requirements</li>
  <li>apply to be authorised by the relevant plant health authority - you’ll need to complete the relevant <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/approval-of-premises-as-place-of-first-arrival-application"><abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> form</a> for plant and plant products or for wood and timber products.</li>
  <li>for goods that are entering the UK via a <abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> port in England or Wales, give notice of a consignment’s arrival and its location to the plant health authority using the <a rel="external" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/">PEACH website</a>
</li>
  <li>for goods that are entering the UK via a <abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> port in <a rel="external" href="https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing">Scotland</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/topics/plant-and-tree-health">Northern Ireland</a>, give notice to the relevant plant health authority</li>
  <li>for regulated wood, wood products or bark, complete a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-of-landing-form">Notice of Landing form</a> for Forestry Commission checks</li>
  <li>hold consignments at your premises until the plant health authority has carried out its checks and released the goods</li>

<ol>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/">Register on the PEACH website</a> or with the Forestry Commission as a registered trader if you are in England or Wales.</li>

  <li>Speak to suppliers about whether the plants and plant products they import from the EU may need third country checks in the UK after Brexit.</li>
  <li>Consider using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-imports-authorised-points-of-entry-to-the-uk">alternative authorised points of entry</a> that avoid <abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> ports.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notice-periods-for-imports-from-third-countries-via-the-eu">Notice periods for imports from third countries via the EU</h2>
<p>You must give notice each time you bring a consignment of regulated goods to the UK from third countries for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consignments brought in by air - 4 working hours</li>
  <li>consignment being brought in by another route - 3 working days</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exporting-plants-and-plant-products-to-the-eu">Exporting plants and plant products to the EU</h2>
<p>In a no deal scenario, the UK will become a third country and will need to meet EU third country import requirements to export regulated plants and plant products to the EU.</p>

<p>For exports to the EU third-country rules will apply on all:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk">plants for planting</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-wood-wood-products-or-bark-from-non-eu-countries">wood, wood products or bark</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-or-export-wood-packaging-material#wpm-imports-from-third-countries-except-switzerland">wood packaging material</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The process for sending regulated plants and plant products to the EU will be the same as the current process for sending them to third countries. When you export regulated plants and plant products to third countries, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check whether a phytosanitary certificate (<abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr>) is required by contacting the plant health authority or a plant health inspector in the destination country</li>
  <li>apply for a <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr> from the relevant UK plant health authority before export - if you’re based in England and Wales you will need to register on the <a rel="external" href="http://edomero.defra.gov.uk/">eDomero system</a> to apply for a <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr>.</li>
  <li>check if your plants require laboratory testing of samples to ensure they are free from pests and diseases or inspections during the growing season - contact your local plant health inspector to find out if your plants need these tests before exporting</li>
</ul>

<p>These services are subject to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-controls#fees">fees and charges</a>.</p>

<p>Regulated plant and plant products exports to the EU from the UK may be subject to checks at the EU border .</p>

<h2 id="plant-passports-and-pest-free-areas">Plant Passports and Pest Free Areas</h2>
<p>Some plants and plant products must meet specific requirements to enter ‘protected zones’ within EU countries. EU Protected Zones (<abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr>) allow EU member states to place controls on imports and movements between member states. This prevents the introduction or spread of plant pests and diseases which are present elsewhere in the EU but absent from the Protected Zone.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-protected-zones-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">Changes to Protected Zones if the UK leaves the EU without a deal</h2>
<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal then the UK cannot designate all or parts of the UK as an EU Protected Zones.</p>

<p>The UK will replace the biosecurity protections provided by EU Protected Zones by creating 2 new designations.</p>

<h3 id="quarantine-pest-designation">Quarantine pest designation</h3>
<p>This will designate the existing plant pests and diseases covered by Protected Zone arrangements as ‘quarantine pests’. Quarantine pests are plant pests and diseases which are not established and which would be damaging if introduced, where they are absent from the whole of the UK.</p>

<p>Quarantine pests are prohibited from entering the UK and are subject to statutory control if found on plants or plants products. The requirements to prevent the entry of these pests will remain same if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<h3 id="pest-free-areas-pfas-designations">Pest Free Areas (PFAs) designations</h3>
<p>This will designate PFAs in line with international standards for those pests and diseases which are absent from part of the UK, but not the whole of the UK. PFAs are declared in line with recognised international standards and requirements. They can be applied to movements of plants and plant products into PFAs.</p>

<p>Both EU <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> and PFAs allow countries to control movements of plants and plant products which may carry plant pests and diseases, where the whole country or an area within the country are free from those pests or diseases. 
Moving from <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> to quarantine pests and PFAs will not change the requirements for goods moving within the UK.</p>

<p>There will be no new import or movement restrictions from the replacement of certain <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> with requirements for quarantine pests. These requirements are already in place now under the <abbr title="Protected Zone">PZ</abbr> system. The requirements for importing into and moving within PFAs will be the same as they currently are for the equivalent <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are moving plants and plant products into or within UK <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> currently, you need to use an EU plant passport. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you will need to use a UK plant passport if you are moving the relevant plants and plant products into or within UK PFAs.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-move-goods-into-or-within-a-uk-pest-free-area-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">How to move goods into or within a UK Pest Free Area if the UK leaves the EU without a deal</h3>
<p>Plants and plant products currently covered by EU plant passports for movements within the UK will need to be moved with a UK plant passport. When moving controlled plants in the UK, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register with the relevant UK plant health authority</li>
  <li>be authorised to issue plant passports</li>
  <li>replace references to ‘EU’ with ‘UK’ when issuing plant passports</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are an existing user of EU plant passports, you do not need to reissue a UK passport but you will need to change the title of your passport from ‘EU’ to ‘UK’.</p>

<p>If you’re providing a UK plant passport to move restricted plants into a UK PFA, you must include ‘PFA’ on the passport, rather than ‘ZP’ followed by the code for that PFA. Codes for PFAs will be the same as the codes for the <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> that they are replacing. For example, the code for ‘Ips Cembrae’ is (a)9.</p>

 in a no deal scenario.</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/issuing-plant-passports-to-trade-plants-in-the-eu">Issuing plant passports to trade plants in the EU</a> to understand how to apply for a UK plant passport.</p>

<h2 id="movement-of-wood-packaging-material">Movement of wood packaging material</h2>
<p>Wood packaging material (<abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr>) moving between the UK and the rest of the EU can currently move freely without checks or controls.</p>

<p><abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pallets</li>
  <li>crates</li>
  <li>boxes</li>
  <li>cable drums</li>
  <li>spools</li>
  <li>dunnage</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of no deal, all <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> moving between the UK and the EU must meet <a rel="external" href="https://www.ippc.int/static/media/files/publication/en/2016/06/ISPM_15_2013_En_2016-06-07.pdf">ISPM15 international standards</a> by undergoing heat treatment and marking. All <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> may be subject to official checks either upon or after entry to the EU.</p>

<p>Checks on <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> will continue to be carried out in the UK on a risk-targeted basis only. The plant health risk from <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> imported from the EU is not expected to change as a result of an EU exit.</p>

<h3 id="steps-to-take-now-to-prepare-for-eu-exit-2">Steps to take now to prepare for EU Exit</h3>
<p>Contact your supplier or <a rel="external" href="http://www.timcon.org/default.asp">TIMCON</a> if you need more advice about moving <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> after the UK leaves the EU with no deal.</p>

<h2 id="trade-agreements">Trade agreements</h2>
<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be no implementation period. In this scenario, the government will seek to bring into force UK-third country agreements from exit day, or as soon as possible afterwards.</p>

<p>These new agreements will replicate existing EU agreements as far as possible. Where replacement trade agreements are not agreed, trade would take place on <a rel="external" href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm">World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms</a> with that country. Details of each agreement will be shared with parliament and the public when they have been agreed.</p>
