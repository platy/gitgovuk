<p>‘Plant’ means a living plant (including a fungus or tree) or a living part of a plant (including a living part of a fungus or shrub), at any stage of growth.</p>

<p>‘Plant product’ means products of plant origin, unprocessed or having undergone simple preparation, in so far as these are not plants, including wood and bark.</p>

<h2 id="importing-plants-and-plant-products-from-the-eu">Importing plants and plant products from the EU</h2>
<p>The majority of plants and plant products (including fruit, vegetables and cut flowers) imported from the EU will continue to enter the UK freely.</p>

<p>Any plants and plant products currently managed under the EU plant passport scheme will be subject to UK import controls and become ‘regulated commodities’ after a no-deal Brexit. This replaces the EU plant passport’s assurance and traceability, and maintains biosecurity.</p>

<p>The EU does not have to carry out plant health checks on regulated third-country goods going to the UK if there’s a no deal Brexit.</p>

<p>Plants and plant products that come from third countries via the EU without plant health checks by an EU member state, will be treated as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk">third-country imports</a>.</p>

<p>Many plants and plant products entering the UK via the EU arrive at fast-moving roll-on roll-off (<abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr>) ports where checks at the border would create significant disruptions to traffic. All third-country plant health regulated material arriving in the UK via <abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> ports requiring checks will have to go to a plant health approved facility for inspection.</p>

<p>These facilities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place of First Arrival (<abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr>) - trade premises that have been authorised to host plant health controls on third country material entering the UK via the EU at <abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> ports</li>
  <li>other facilities that have been authorised for Plant Health control (‘alternative inspection posts’)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must ensure that plant health checks are carried out on third-country material entering the UK via the EU by doing one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/approval-of-premises-as-place-of-first-arrival-application">registering a place of first arrival (<abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr>)</a></li>
  <li>using a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk#points-of-entry">non-<abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> point of entry</a> where checks can take place at the border</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk#inspection-fees">charged for checks on third country plant health material</a> by the relevant plant health authority.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-register-as-a-place-of-first-arrival">How to register as a place of first arrival</h2>

<p>You may need to speak to suppliers about whether the plants and plant products they import from third countries are likely to move to the UK via the EU. Consider whether to apply for <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> status before Brexit.</p>

<p>To import third-country material that need plant health checks in the UK via <abbr title="roll-on roll-off">RoRo</abbr> ports, you’ll need to have access to a <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr>. You can register your own <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reading the <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> standards and take any necessary steps to ensure your premises meet the requirements</li>
  <li>applying to be authorised by the relevant plant health authority - you’ll need to complete the relevant <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> form for plant and plant products or for wood and timber products.</li>
</ul>

<p>To bring in material for checks at an authorised <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr>, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/approval-and-operation-of-plant-health-inspection-facilities-at-place-of-first-arrival">read the <abbr title="Place of First Arrival">PoFA</abbr> standards</a> and take any necessary steps to ensure your premises meet the requirements</li>

  <li>
<a rel="external" href="http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/">Register on the <abbr title="Procedure for Electronic Application for Certificates from the Horticultural Marketing Inspectorate">PEACH</abbr> website</a> or with the Forestry Commission as a registered trader if you are in England or Wales.</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="notice-periods-for-imports-from-third-countries-via-the-eu">Notice periods for imports from third countries via the EU</h2>
<p>You must give notice each time you bring a consignment of regulated goods to the UK from third countries for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consignments brought in by air - 4 working hours</li>
  <li>consignment being brought in by another route - 3 working days</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exporting-plants-and-plant-products-to-the-eu">Exporting plants and plant products to the EU</h2>
<p>The UK will become a third country and will need to meet EU third country import requirements to export regulated plants and plant products to the EU if there’s a no deal Brexit.</p>

<p>For exports to the EU third-country rules will apply on all:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk">plants for planting</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-wood-wood-products-or-bark-from-non-eu-countries">wood, wood products or bark</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-or-export-wood-packaging-material#wpm-imports-from-third-countries-except-switzerland">wood packaging material</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The process for sending regulated plants and plant products to the EU will be the same as the current process for sending them to third countries. When you export regulated plants and plant products to third countries, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check whether a phytosanitary certificate (<abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr>) is required by contacting the plant health authority or a plant health inspector in the destination country</li>
  <li>apply for a <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr> from the relevant UK plant health authority before export - if you’re based in England and Wales you will need to register on the <a rel="external" href="http://edomero.defra.gov.uk/">eDomero system</a> to apply for a <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>check if your plants require laboratory testing of samples to ensure they are free from pests and diseases or inspections during the growing season - contact your local plant health inspector to find out if your plants need these tests before exporting</li>
</ul>

<p>These services are subject to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-controls#fees">fees and charges</a>.</p>

<p>Regulated plant and plant products exports to the EU from the UK may be subject to checks at the EU border .</p>

This means that all relevant plants and plant products will need a phytosanitary certificate upon entry to the EU unless exempted.</p>

<p>Exempted food includes processed food or food products, for example prepared salads, sandwiches and stir-fry mixes.</p>

<p>The list of relevant plants and plant products which need a phytosanitary certificate for export to the EU will significantly increase under <abbr title="Smarter Rules for Safer Food">SRSF</abbr>. The introduction of these changes for exports to the EU is not dependent on Brexit.</p>

</span>
 guide lists all plants and plant products originating in the UK that will require a phytosanitary certificate for export to the EU. Exporters should check with the relevant plant health authority in the importing country to find out what controls will apply when exporting plants and plant products.</p>

<h2 id="plant-passports-and-pest-free-areas">Plant Passports and Pest Free Areas</h2>
<p>Some plants and plant products must meet specific requirements to enter <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/issuing-plant-passports-to-trade-plants-in-the-eu#when-you-need-a-plant-passport">‘protected zones’</a> within EU countries.</p>

<p>EU Protected Zones (<abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr>) allow EU member states to place controls on imports and movements between member states. This prevents the introduction or spread of plant pests and diseases which are present elsewhere in the EU but absent from the Protected Zone.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-protected-zones-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">Changes to Protected Zones if the UK leaves the EU without a deal</h2>
<p>The UK cannot designate all or parts of the UK as an EU Protected Zones if there’s a no deal Brexit.</p>

<p>The UK will replace the biosecurity protections provided by EU Protected Zones by creating 2 new designations.</p>

<h3 id="quarantine-pest-designation">Quarantine pest designation</h3>
<p>This will designate the existing plant pests and diseases covered by Protected Zone arrangements as ‘quarantine pests’. Quarantine pests are plant pests and diseases which are not established and which would be damaging if introduced, where they are absent from the whole of the UK.</p>

<p>Quarantine pests are prohibited from entering the UK and are subject to statutory control if found on plants or plants products. The requirements to prevent the entry of these pests will remain the same if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<h3 id="pest-free-areas-pfas-designations">Pest Free Areas (<abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr>) designations</h3>
<p>This will designate <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> in line with international standards for those pests and diseases which are absent from part of the UK, but not the whole of the UK. <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> are declared in line with recognised international standards and requirements. They can be applied to movements of plants and plant products into <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Both EU <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> and <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> allow countries to control movements of plants and plant products which may carry plant pests and diseases, where the whole country or an area within the country are free from those pests or diseases. 
Moving from <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> to quarantine pests and <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> will not change the requirements for goods moving within the UK.</p>

<p>There will be no new import or movement restrictions from the replacement of certain <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> with requirements for quarantine pests. These requirements are already in place now under the <abbr title="Protected Zone">PZ</abbr> system. The requirements for importing into and moving within <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> will be the same as they currently are for the equivalent <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are moving plants and plant products into or within UK <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> currently, you need to use an EU plant passport. You will need to use a UK plant passport if you’re moving the relevant plants and plant products into or within UK <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-move-goods-into-or-within-a-uk-pest-free-area-if-theres-a-no-deal-brexit">How to move goods into or within a UK Pest Free Area if there’s a no deal Brexit</h3>
<p>Plants and plant products currently covered by EU plant passports for movements within the UK will need to be moved with a UK plant passport. When moving controlled plants in the UK, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register with the relevant UK plant health authority</li>
  <li>be authorised to issue plant passports</li>
  <li>replace references to ‘EU’ with ‘UK’ when issuing plant passports</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are an existing user of EU plant passports, you do not need to reissue a UK passport but you will need to change the title of your passport from ‘EU’ to ‘UK’.</p>

<p>If you’re providing a UK plant passport to move restricted plants into a UK <abbr title="Pest Free Area">PFA</abbr>, you must include ‘<abbr title="Pest Free Area">PFA</abbr>’ on the passport, rather than ‘ZP’ followed by the code for that <abbr title="Pest Free Area">PFA</abbr>. Codes for <abbr title="Pest Free Areas">PFAs</abbr> will be the same as the codes for the <abbr title="Protected Zones">PZs</abbr> that they are replacing. For example, the code for ‘Ips Cembrae’ is (a)9.</p>

<h2 id="movement-of-wood-packaging-material">Movement of wood packaging material</h2>
<p>Wood packaging material (<abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr>) moving between the UK and the rest of the EU can currently move freely without checks or controls.</p>

<p><abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pallets</li>
  <li>crates</li>
  <li>boxes</li>
  <li>cable drums</li>
  <li>spools</li>
  <li>dunnage</li>
</ul>

<p>All <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> moving between the UK and the EU must meet <a rel="external" href="https://www.ippc.int/static/media/files/publication/en/2016/06/ISPM_15_2013_En_2016-06-07.pdf">ISPM15 international standards</a> by undergoing heat treatment and marking if there’s a no deal Brexit. All <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> may be subject to official checks either upon or after entry to the EU.</p>

<p>Checks on <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> will continue to be carried out in the UK on a risk-targeted basis only. The plant health risk from <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> imported from the EU is not expected to change as a result of Brexit.</p>

<h3 id="steps-to-take-now-to-prepare-for-a-no-deal-brexit-1">Steps to take now to prepare for a no deal Brexit</h3>
<p>Contact your supplier or <a rel="external" href="http://www.timcon.org/default.asp">TIMCON</a> if you need more advice about moving <abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr> if the UK leaves the EU with no deal.</p>

<h2 id="trade-agreements">Trade agreements</h2>
<p>There will be no implementation period after exit day.</p>

<p>Any new agreements will replicate existing EU agreements as far as possible. Where replacement trade agreements are not agreed, trade would take place on <a rel="external" href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm">World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms</a> with that country. Details of each agreement will be shared with parliament and the public when they have been agreed.</p>
