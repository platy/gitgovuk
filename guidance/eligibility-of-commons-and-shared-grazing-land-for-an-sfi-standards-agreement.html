<p>This information explains the eligibility requirements for common land or an area of shared grazing to be entered into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement.</p>

<p>You should read this information with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sustainable-farming-incentive-guidance">other Sustainable Farming Incentive standards information</a> which applies to all <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreements.</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this information if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you don’t have to follow it.</p>

<p>This information will be kept under review as <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> is rolled out.</p>

<h2>Definition of common land and shared grazing</h2>

<p>For the purposes of an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, ‘common land’ means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>land registered as common land in a register of common land kept under Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006</li>
  <li>land to which Part 1 of that Act does not apply and which is subject to rights of common within the meaning of that Act</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Shared grazing’ means communal pasture that is not registered as common land where graziers have a legal entitlement to graze. For example, a pasture used jointly by tenants.</p>

<p>The following information about commons also applies to areas of shared grazing.</p>

<h2>Applying for an agreement on common land</h2>

<p>You must enter common land or an area of shared grazing into its own <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The agreement cannot include other land you own or rent that is not common land.</p>

<p>This means that you must submit separate applications in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the common land and shared grazing, using the existing single entity’s Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) or a new <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> if a single entity needs to be set up</li>
  <li>land you own or rent that is not common land, using the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> for your own business</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eligibility to enter common land into an agreement</h2>

<p>To enter common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>) eligibility rule</li>
  <li>be a single entity, either as a sole beneficiary or a group</li>
  <li>have a formal, legally enforceable internal arrangement for a group</li>
  <li>have sufficient management control of the common land to complete the actions for the duration of the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>The following information gives more information about each of these requirements.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility rule</h3>

<p>You must be eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> to apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement in 2022.</p>

<p>For common land, the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility rule is met if one or more people were eligible to use the common to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2021 or 2022. They don’t need to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2022 or to have received <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments in the past.</p>

<h3>Only a ‘single entity’ can apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on commons</h3>

<p>Only a ‘single entity’ can enter into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on a common. This is to make sure that, where there is a group, the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement can be delivered by the single entity for the agreement’s 3-year duration.</p>

<p>A single entity can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a person who will be the sole beneficiary</li>
  <li>a group of two or more people with a formal, legally enforceable internal arrangement between them, a nominated representative and a single bank account</li>
</ul>

<p>A sole beneficiary will usually be a landowner who owns the whole common and has sole use and rights to the common.</p>

<p>A common may already have a single entity to oversee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an existing Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) or Higher Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>) agreement on the common</li>
  <li>general management of the common</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be possible for the group to extend the scope of the existing single entity (provided it meets the 4 criteria explained below for a new single entity). This single entity should apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, using the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> it already has.</p>

<p>There should not be more than one single entity overseeing an agri-environment scheme agreement for the same area of land on the common. This includes <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>, <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> and <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a group has not already set up a single entity to oversee an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreements or the general management of the common, it will need to do this before it applies for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on the common. It must register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a> to obtain a new <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>, even if some of the members already have their own SBIs individually.</p>

<p>It’s up to the group to decide how the new single entity is set up, but it must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a main business contact identified for the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> (the nominated representative)</li>
  <li>a bank account that’s registered with the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a formal, legally enforceable internal arrangement between the single entity’s members to deal with any breaches of the agreement that may lead to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> recovering payments</li>
  <li>sufficient management control of the common land to complete land management actions for the duration of the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about management control under ‘Common land eligibility’.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship-higher-tier-manual-for-agreements-starting-on-1-january-2022/annex-6-common-land-and-shared-grazing-additional-requirements">Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) guidance</a> about setting up a commons association or an internal agreement for common land and shared grazing. Where this <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> guidance uses the word ‘must’ or ‘should’, that requirement applies to a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, not an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>In setting up the single entity you may want to consider issues such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how changes in membership will be dealt with</li>
  <li>how payments will be distributed among members</li>
  <li>whether the nominated representative will give permission in the Rural Payments service for other members to view the relevant documentation</li>
  <li>how disputes will be resolved within the group</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not have to submit a copy of your formal internal arrangement to us, but you must supply this evidence to us if we ask for it.</p>

<h4>Additional payment for a single entity on common land</h4>

<p>To help with the costs of administering an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land, there is an annual additional payment of £6.15 per hectare of eligible common land entered into its own <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Our intention is that this payment will be available to single entities involving a group of two or more people entering common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>In future, as more standards are made available, this additional payment will continue to be paid per hectare of eligible common land entered into the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, irrespective of the number of standards in the agreement.</p>

<p>This payment will be kept under review as <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> is rolled out.</p>

<h2>Common land eligibility</h2>

<p>An area of common land is eligible to be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s wholly located in England</li>
  <li>the type of land and its mapped land cover are eligible for the standard(s) selected</li>
  <li>the single entity will have sufficient management control for the duration of the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eligible land cover and type of land</h2>

<p>You can only enter an area of common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if it’s eligible for the standard you choose. This means it needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>be an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the ‘Eligible land’ section in each standard for more information about eligible land cover and land type.</p>

<p>Common land is not shown on your digital maps. You can check the maps we have previously provided to you to check the land cover on the common land. When you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on common land, you will be able to view the land parcels on a digital map as part of the application process. Before applications open, we’ll publish information on GOV.UK to help you apply on common land.</p>

<h3>What area of common land can be entered into <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a whole common</li>
  <li>more than one whole common, if they are managed as a single unit</li>
  <li>part of a common, if it’s a defined area that’s managed as a separate, single unit and the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement won’t impact land management practices on the remaining part of the common</li>
</ul>

<p>If the common is in an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement, that same land can be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s eligible for the standards selected</li>
  <li>the activities being paid for under each scheme are compatible</li>
  <li>a similar activity isn’t being paid for on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended that the same <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement land is entered into the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h2>Management control</h2>

<p>To enter common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, the single entity must have sufficient management control of that land for the 3-year duration of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>The single entity should have management control of the common land if it has sufficient control over how the land is managed to complete the actions in the standards chosen for the duration of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>The single entity must judge whether it has sufficient management control. This does not mean that every commoner has to agree or become part of the single entity. However, it does mean that those who are part of the single entity need to be able to deliver the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>To have sufficient management control, the group will need to consider whether the landowner needs to be part of the single entity. A group must also assess if the landowner’s consent is needed for the single entity to complete the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If the landowner’s consent is needed, the group must obtain it.</p>

<p>Before applying for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, a group must take reasonable steps to contact and consult everyone with a legal interest in managing the common land. This is to make sure they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are aware of the group’s intention to enter the common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>have the chance to participate in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>The people with a legal interest in managing the common land include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all known common rights holders, whether they’re actively using their rights or not</li>
  <li>the landowner</li>
  <li>tenants</li>
  <li>anyone who has an easement or other rights and covenants over the land, including sporting tenants</li>
</ul>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship-higher-tier-manual-for-agreements-starting-on-1-january-2022/annex-6-common-land-and-shared-grazing-additional-requirements"><abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> guidance</a> for more information about consulting other people with a legal interest in managing the common. Where this <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> guidance uses the word ‘must’ or ‘should’, that requirement applies to a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, not an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>When the single entity enters common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, it declares that it will have management control of that land for the agreement’s 3-year duration. The single entity must supply evidence of this if we ask for it.</p>

<h2>Entering into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land operates in the same way as an agreement on land outside a common.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement conflicts with any statutory requirements for the management of the common, those statutory requirements take precedence. For example, if the common land is in an SSSI, or there are public engagement commitments. For more information, read the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> scheme information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-regulatory-issues-and-consents-that-could-affect-an-sfi-standards-agreement">regulatory issues and consents</a>.</p>

<p>Any breach of the common land <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement will only apply to that agreement. It will not apply to any separate <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement for land outside of the common that you own or rent.</p>

<p>If the single entity decides to upgrade its <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, it may need to check it still has management control and whether it needs any regulatory consents.  As <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> is rolled out we will review this guidance and issue more information as required.</p>
