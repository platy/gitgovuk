<p>Changes made to the scheme from 18 February 2022 remove the requirement for pigmeat, from pigs slaughtered during a <abbr title="Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme">SIPS</abbr> 2022 shift, to go for export or into the Private Storage Aid Scheme.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>These changes apply to SIPS 2022 shifts worked on or after 18 February 2022.</p>

<p>Separate guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/slaughter-incentive-payment-scheme-2022">Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme 2022</a> applies to SIPS 2022 shifts worked before 18 February 2022.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> has been working closely with industry to understand how best to support them in response to the challenges caused by the pandemic, access to CO2 supplies, a temporary shortage of labour (specifically skilled butchers) and the loss of the Chinese market to several processing plants (as a result of the pandemic).
This led to a growing number of pigs backing up on farm and impacted the capacity of processors to slaughter and process pigs. Pig prices have fallen and without continued intervention could rapidly fall very significantly further.</p>

<p>On 14 October 2021, Government announced a package of measures to support the pig industry and to seek to reduce the animal welfare implications of pigs backing up on farms. This package included measures to increase the throughput of pigs through processors.</p>

<p>The Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme">SIPS</abbr>) aim was to increase the throughput of pigs by contributing towards the extra costs involved in operating additional slaughter shifts at abattoirs. <abbr title="Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme">SIPS</abbr> closed on 20 December 2021.</p>

<p>The revised SIP scheme (<abbr title="Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme">SIPS</abbr> 2022) aims to incentivise processors to maximise the use of additional butchers from 14 January 2022 by putting on more shifts than has been possible at the end of 2021.</p>

<p>Following discussions with industry, changes made to the scheme from 18 February 2022 remove the requirement for pigmeat, from pigs slaughtered during a <abbr title="Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme">SIPS</abbr> 2022 shift, to go for export or into the Private Storage Aid Scheme, which opened in November 2021.</p>

<p>The increase in the payment rate for eligible pigs slaughtered during the <abbr title="Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme">SIPS</abbr> 2022 shifts from £3 to £10 per pig remains in place. The requirement for pigmeat entering <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-to-traders-8721-private-storage-aid-psa-pigmeat/notice-to-traders-8721-private-storage-aid-psa-pigmeat">Private Storage Aid</a> to meet the relevant scheme rules also remains.</p>

<p>The scheme remains limited to 100,000 pigs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme">SIPS</abbr> 2022 will continue to be administered by the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Scheme dates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>14 January 2022 - Scheme opens: first date additional shifts can be worked</li>

  <li>29 April 2022 – Claim window closes.</li>
</ul>
