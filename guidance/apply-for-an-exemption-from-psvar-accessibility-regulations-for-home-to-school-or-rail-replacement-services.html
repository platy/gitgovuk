<h2>Who is eligible for an exemption?</h2>

<p>The exemption is for operators with coaches that are non-compliant or partially compliant with <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr> 2000, which are used to provide either or both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a ‘closed door’ home-to-school (<abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr>) service, transporting eligible passengers to and from educational institutions</li>
  <li>a rail replacement (<abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr>) service, transporting passengers to their destinations when train services cannot run</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply, you’ll need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your contact details</li>
  <li>your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-vehicle-operator-licence">operator (‘O’) licence number</a>
</li>
  <li>the vehicle identification number (VIN) for every vehicle in your fleet used for <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> or <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> services, whether compliant with <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr> or not</li>
  <li>contact details for the commissioning train operating company or companies -  if providing <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> services</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The period for application has now concluded.</p>
</div>

<p>For us to process your application and (where applicable) issue an exemption before current exemptions expire, applications must be received by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>17 May 2022 for fleets providing <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> services</li>
  <li>17 May 2022 for fleets providing both <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> and <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> services</li>
  <li>31 May 2022 for fleets providing <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> services</li>
</ul>

<p>Only one application will be required from each operator, whether they are applying for exemptions to operate <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr>, <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> or both services.</p>

<p>Where applications are received after the deadline, we cannot guarantee that they will be processed, or that any resulting exemption certificate will be issued ahead of the current round of short-term exemptions expiring.</p>

<h2>Exemption period</h2>

<p>Where granted, exemptions will commence on 1 July 2022 (replacing any existing exemptions which are due to expire on 30 June 2022 for <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> and 31 July 2022 for <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> services) and expire on 31 July 2026, contingent on the holder meeting their compliance terms.</p>

<h2>Exemption use</h2>

<p>A copy of the exemption must be carried onboard any vehicle in the operator’s fleet that is not fully compliant with <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr>, and is used for <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> or <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> services.</p>

<p>An exemption does not absolve the commissioner of an <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> or <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> service from the obligation to provide alternative accessible transport to passengers who cannot access vehicles covered by an exemption because they do not comply with <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr>. Operators holding an exemption must obtain and retain alongside the exemption written confirmation that such alternative accessible transport will be provided.</p>

<h2>Compliance</h2>

<p>Non-compliance with any terms and conditions listed on the exemption certificate will be treated as non-compliance with <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr>, and may be subject to enforcement action by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>. This includes adhering to exemption terms which will require increasing levels of compliance with <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr> over time.</p>

<p>These exemptions will expire on 31 July 2026. From 1 August 2026, operators will be expected to comply with <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr> in full, subject to any changes which may be implemented as a result of the upcoming review of <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Exemption compliance schedule</h3>

<p>Exemption compliance requirements will depend on the band assigned.</p>

<p>When determining the number of fleet vehicles required to comply via percentage calculation, numbers must always be rounded up, even when the percentage is a decimal point of less than 0.5. For example, a calculation of 1.3 vehicles would mean 2 vehicles must comply.</p>

<p>These tables outline the minimum compliance level required. Operators are encouraged to exceed these minimum requirements.</p>

<h3>Compliance schedule bands</h3>

<p>All vehicles granted an exemption will be exempt from <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr> between 1 July 2022 and 31 July 2023.</p>

<h4>Band A requirements</h4>

<p>Read the section below on compliance schedule definitions.</p>

<h4>Compliance schedule definitions</h4>
<p>‘Fleet’ refers to the total number of vehicles used for <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> or <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> services. Vehicles not used for either <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> or <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> services should not be counted. <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> services with no paying customers are not in scope of <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr>. A vehicle used for <abbr title="home-to-school">HTS</abbr> or <abbr title="rail replacement">RR</abbr> services that is temporarily out of service is still considered to be part of the fleet, subject to the judgment of <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> during any inspection.</p>

<p>‘Fully compliant’ refers to a vehicle that complies with all paragraphs of the following parts of <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/1970/schedules/made" rel="external">schedule 1, concerning facilities for wheelchair users</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/1970/schedules/made#schedule-3" rel="external">schedule 3, concerning other accessibility features</a></li>
</ul>

<p>‘Partially compliant’ refers to a vehicle that is not fully compliant, but as a minimum complies with the following parts of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/1970/schedules/made#schedule-3" rel="external"><abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000">PSVAR</abbr> schedule 3</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paragraph 2 (floors and gangways)</li>
  <li>paragraph 3 (seats)</li>
  <li>paragraph 4 (steps, excluding sub-paragraphs 1d, 1e, 1f, and 5)</li>
  <li>paragraph 5 (handrails)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Band changes</h4>

<p>A change in fleet size could lead to a band change. For example, if an operator’s fleet size expanded from 5 to 6 vehicles as a result of acquiring a new vehicle, they would move from band A to band B.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>It is the operator’s responsibility to determine whether a band change has occurred.</p>
</div>

<p>Where an operator’s band has changed, they must within 5 working days of the change <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">contact us at the email address below</a>.</p>

<h2>Contact us</h2>

<p>You can report a band change or contact us with any questions via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:psvar@dft.gov.uk">psvar@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>
