<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Help to Grow: Digital is a UK-wide scheme to help small and medium size businesses (<abbr title="small and medium size businesses">SMEs</abbr>) adopt digital technologies that are proven to increase their productivity.</p>

<p>The scheme offers <abbr title="small and medium size businesses">SMEs</abbr> free and impartial advice on how technology can help their business. An online platform helps them to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify their digital technology needs</li>
  <li>assess technology purchasing options</li>
  <li>implement new technologies in their operations</li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme also offers eligible <abbr title="small and medium size businesses">SMEs</abbr> a <a class="govuk-link" href="#grant-token">grant token</a> worth up to £5,000 to cover up to half of the costs of pre-approved, digital technology solutions.</p>

<p>The Help to Grow: Digital scheme launched in January 2022. It will run for 3 years, taking a phased approach over a number of waves. Each wave will provide the opportunity to roll out new technologies and functionalities for <abbr title="small and medium size businesses">SMEs</abbr> and vendors.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="small and medium size business">SME</abbr> eligibility</h2>

<p><abbr title="small and medium size businesses">SMEs</abbr> eligible for the grant token will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have between 5 and 249 employees</li>
  <li>be a UK company registered with Companies House or on the Financial Conduct Authority’s Mutuals Register</li>
  <li>be incorporated and actively trading for over a year before they apply for the discount</li>
  <li>be purchasing the software for the first time</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Eligible SMEs are able to claim a grant token for 1 technology product only at this time. SMEs who have used a grant token for Customer Relationship Management or Accounting software will not be eligible to purchase an ecommerce solution.</p>
</div>

<h2>Vendor eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible vendors will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a UK company registered with Companies House</li>
  <li>be incorporated and actively trading for at least a year</li>
  <li>be a producer and vendor of <a class="govuk-link" href="#products">eligible ecommerce technology</a> or a key subcontractor providing the product in line with the terms and conditions (we are not accepting resellers or partner networks)</li>
  <li>demonstrate cyber security measures are in place (verified against a number of tests)</li>
  <li>be GDPR compliant</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to undergo fraud and eligibility checks in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1057436/help-to-grow-digital-terms-conditions-ecommerce-vendor.pdf" rel="external">terms and conditions (PDF)</a> of the scheme. This will include credit checks to ensure financial viability and sanctions screening. Successful vendors will be subject to regular fraud and eligibility checks, at least every 12 months.</p>

<p>You will need to put in place additional technical capabilities to comply with the grant token requirements.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/help-to-grow-digital-vendor-application-documents-ecommerce/help-to-grow-digital-vendor-application-guidance-ecommerce">See the vendor application guidance for more information.</a></p>

<h2>Product eligibility</h2>

<p>Ecommerce products are the only technology eligible for this wave of the scheme.</p>

<p>You will need to demonstrate that products:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/help-to-grow-digital-vendor-application-documents-ecommerce/help-to-grow-digital-vendor-application-guidance-ecommerce">minimum functionality specifications for ecommerce products</a>
</li>
  <li>can be purchased through a complete online retail buying journey in a self-service capacity, at the time of the application (if your online buying journey is not clear from your website, you may need to provide additional evidence such as screenshots)</li>
  <li>have a listed price without the need for a negotiated sales process (if the price is not visible on your website, you may need to provide additional evidence such as screenshots)</li>
  <li>have out of the box functionality with minimum configuration required (the product should have business ready processes, screens, and data requirements available as a default solution)</li>
  <li>have an existing UK <abbr title="small and medium size business">SME</abbr> customer base, illustrating that it’s supporting UK <abbr title="small and medium size businesses">SMEs</abbr> (this will be reviewed against a threshold set by BEIS)</li>
  <li>provide the expected functionality and capability in a stand-alone solution that enables the <abbr title="small and medium size business">SME</abbr> to publish their own commerce presence and storefront online</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/help-to-grow-digital-vendor-application-documents-ecommerce/help-to-grow-digital-vendor-application-guidance-ecommerce">demonstrate adherence to cyber security protection measures</a></li>
  <li>are sold as a software solution (either as a Software as a Service (<abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr>) or on-premise solution including monthly subscription, annual or multi-year contract) and not as a pay per use service (the software may have elements of pay per use within them, but costs associated with those functions would not be covered by the grant token, and the vendor should clearly state this to the <abbr title="small and medium size business">SME</abbr>)</li>
  <li>have a verifiable history of use (over 12 months) by <abbr title="small and medium size businesses">SMEs</abbr> using customer retention rates (this will be reviewed against a threshold set by BEIS)</li>
  <li>are endorsed by customers through the use of public rating sites (G2, Capterra or GetApp) (these reviews must be at product level and will be reviewed against a threshold set by BEIS)</li>
</ul>

<p>All eligibility criteria listed above must be met at time of application. Applications will not be considered where the vendor must make changes to products or processes to make them eligible.</p>

<p>This eligibility criteria will be reviewed and may be updated ahead of future waves. We intend to bring additional technology categories into the scheme in future waves.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/help-to-grow-digital-vendor-application-documents-ecommerce/help-to-grow-digital-vendor-application-guidance-ecommerce">See the vendor application guidance for more information.</a></p>

<h3>Excluded products</h3>

<p>Ecommerce must be the core capability provided by eligible products. It must not be a module within a larger product ecosystem.</p>

<p>Products not currently eligible for the scheme include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add-ons and integrated solutions that extend capability following an ecosystem approach (this applies to all technologies that take a similar modular approach to providing capabilities or have an app marketplace that sells add-on components developed by independent software vendors or partners (<abbr title="independent software vendors">ISVs</abbr>/<abbr title="independent software partners">ISPs</abbr>))</li>
  <li>single product ‘business management solutions’ targeting fuller operational capability and broader functional coverage providing capability for end-to-end operational management</li>
  <li>existing marketplace ‘seller accounts’ that allow an <abbr title="small and medium size business">SME</abbr> to publish and sell their product catalogue</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list of excluded software types or packages. You should consider how your product fits against all eligibility criteria when submitting your applications.</p>

<h2>Grant tokens</h2>

<p>The Help to Grow: Digital scheme offers eligible <abbr title="small and medium size businesses">SMEs</abbr> up to £5,000 to cover up to half of the costs of pre-approved, digital technology solutions for 12 months.</p>

<p>The grant token is redeemable with eligible vendors, for approved products. It’s for vendors to calculate and provide the discount when an <abbr title="small and medium size business">SME</abbr> makes an eligible purchase, in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1057436/help-to-grow-digital-terms-conditions-ecommerce-vendor.pdf" rel="external">terms and conditions (PDF)</a>.</p>

<p>It’s the vendors responsibility to seek reimbursement for the value of the grant token from the scheme administrator.</p>
