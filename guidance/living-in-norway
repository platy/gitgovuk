<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Norway before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>If you move to Norway before 31 December 2020, you need to register with the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (<abbr title="Norwegian Directorate of Immigration">UDI</abbr>). Youâ€™ll need to <a rel="external" href="https://selfservice.udi.no/en-gb/" class="govuk-link">fill in a <abbr title="Norwegian Directorate of Immigration">UDI</abbr> application form and book an appointment</a>. You must bring the completed application and any requested documents with you to the appointment.</p>

<p>Read the <abbr title="Norwegian Directorate of Immigration">UDI</abbr> guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/" class="govuk-link">types of residence permits and the documents needed to apply</a>.</p>

<p>You can apply for a residency permit at your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.sua.no/en" class="govuk-link">service centre for foreign workers (SUA)</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have your residency permit, you can apply for a Norwegian personal number from the local people register (Folkeregister). Read more on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/" class="govuk-link">Norwegian Directorate of Immigration website</a>.</p>

<p>All UK nationals resident in Norway by 31 December 2020, including those who have previously registered, will need to get a new residency card. This new residency card is scheduled to be introduced in January 2021.</p>

<p>Read the Norwegian government <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/important-messages/brexit-transition-period-for-british-citizens-in-norway-until-31.-december-2020/" class="govuk-link">guidance on the new residency permit</a>.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency application processes, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-norway" class="govuk-link">sign up for updates</a> to this guidance.</p>

<p>If you move to Norway after 31 December 2020, different immigration rules will apply. Read the Norwegian government <a rel="external" href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/reminder-rules-will-change-for-british-citizens-wishing-to-move-to-norway-after-1-january-2021/id2721867/" class="govuk-link">guidance on moving to Norway from 1 January 2021</a>.</p>

<h3 id="uk-nationals-support-fund">UK Nationals Support Fund</h3>

<p>The government has announced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-allocates-3-million-to-support-uk-nationals-in-the-eu" class="govuk-link">funding for organisations to provide practical support to UK nationals</a> who may have difficulty completing their residency applications.â€¯</p>

<p>This support is available only to those who need additional help. This may include pensioners, disabled people, people living in remote areas or who have mobility difficulties.</p>

<p>The services available for people who need this additional support include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>answering questions about residency applications, such as the documents required and application procedure</li>
  <li>guiding individuals through the process, if necessary</li>
  <li>supporting people facing language barriers or difficulty accessing technology</li>
</ul>

<p>In Norway, this support is being provided by The AIRE Centre. If you or someone you know may have difficulty completing the paperwork, you can contact them using the details below to discuss how they may be able to help you.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Norway.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Norway, and you are in scope of the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> Separation Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from EU, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to other Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the UK and Ireland will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>UK nationals who are legally resident in Norway will be allowed to re-enter the country when travelling but may need to show proof of residency. This could happen at the Norwegian border or at an airport outside of Norway.</p>

<p>There will be a new residency card for UK nationals living in Norway to help prove your status when travelling. The application system is due to open in January.</p>

<p>From 1 January until you receive the new residency card, you should always carry one of the approved documents proving residency. This can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a registration certificate</li>
  <li>a residence permit</li>
  <li>aâ€¯residence certificate (bostedsattest)</li>
</ul>

<p>Residence certificates can be ordered from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/national-registry/certificates-and-information/other-certificates/what-certificates-do-you-need/residence-certificate/" class="govuk-link">Norwegian Tax Administration viaâ€¯Altinn</a>. Read more about this on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/brexit/british-citizens-living-in-norway/#link-18858" class="govuk-link">Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (<abbr title="Norwegian Directorate of Immigration">UDI</abbr>) advice page</a>. You should order this well in advance of any trips outside of Norway.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-norway">Driving in Norway</h2>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until at least 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>You should exchange your UK licence for a Norwegian licence.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Norway, read our guidance on:</p>

<h3 id="bringing-a-uk-registered-vehicle-to-norway">Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Norway</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the European Unionâ€™s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/norway/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link">car registration rules and taxes in Norway</a>. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so, you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-norway">Working in Norway</h2>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in an EU country</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link">UK criminal records check</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have a job offer, you need to apply for a personal number at your local police station or your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.sua.no/en/" class="govuk-link">service centre for foreign workers</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Norway on or before 31 December 2020, your right to work will not change as long as you remain resident in Norway.</p>

<h3 id="frontier-workers">Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Norway and commute to work in an EU or <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> country, from January 2021 you may need a permit to prove that you are a frontier worker. We will update this guidance when more information is available.</p>

<h2 id="education-and-professional-qualifications">Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>Get your UK professional qualifications recognised in Norway before 31 December 2020. For help with this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>find out where to request recognition of your qualifications on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nokut.no/en/about-nokut/" class="govuk-link">Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education (NOKUT) website</a>
</li>
  <li>read the European Commissionâ€™s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/slides_professional-qualifications-ip-justice-consumers_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">recognition of professional qualifications</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you hold a professional qualification that has already been recognised by an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country, it will still be valid after 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you have not had your professional qualifications recognised, you can submit an application under the current rules until 31 December 2020.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-norway">Studying in Norway</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Norway on or before 31 December 2020, your right to student finance will remain unchanged, as long as you remain resident in Norway.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>Social security coordination is covered by the Separation Agreement for those residing in Norway. Current healthcare arrangements will continue to apply in full to UK nationals who are resident in Norway before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, for as long as they remain in scope of the agreement.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-norway" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare in Norway</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll pay into the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme (NIS) through your income tax. The NIS covers basic medical services, although you will sometimes have to pay a small fee. Children under 16 get free medical care.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Norway temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-norway#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and are living in Norway before the end of 2020, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same from 1 January 2021 if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Norway and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-norway#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on using an S1 form in Norway</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Norway, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC for healthcare in Norway.</p>

<p>When you travel from Norway for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state healthcare for free or at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re a UK student in Norway or have a registered S1 you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC. This EHIC will remain valid from 1 January 2021. <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a>.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Norway to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Norway have not changed.</p>

<p>You can read our guidance on:</p>

<p>Most people living in Europe should not see any change to their banking after 31 December 2020.
