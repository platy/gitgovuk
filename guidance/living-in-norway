<p>All UK nationals resident in Norway by 31 December 2020, including those who have previously registered, will need to a new residency card. This new residency card is scheduled to be introduced in January 2021.</p>

<p>Read the Norwegian government <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/important-messages/brexit-transition-period-for-british-citizens-in-norway-until-31.-december-2020/" class="govuk-link">guidance on the new residency permit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>We will update these pages with details of any changes to the rules as soon as information is available. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-norway" class="govuk-link">sign up for updates</a> to this guidance.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-norway">Driving in Norway</h2>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until at least 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>You should exchange your UK licence for a Norwegian licence. You can still use your Norwegian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Norway, read our guidance on:</p>

<h3 id="bringing-a-uk-registered-vehicle-to-norway">Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Norway</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the European Unionâ€™s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/norway/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link">car registration rules and taxes in Norway</a>. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so, you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-norway">Working in Norway</h2>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in an EU country</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link">UK criminal records check</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have a job offer, you need to apply for a personal number at your local police station or your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.sua.no/en/" class="govuk-link">service centre for foreign workers</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Norway on or before 31 December 2020, your right to work will not change as long as you remain resident in Norway.</p>

<h2 id="education-and-professional-qualifications">Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>Get your UK professional qualifications recognised in Norway before 31 December 2020. For help with this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>find out where to request recognition of your qualifications on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nokut.no/en/about-nokut/" class="govuk-link">Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education (NOKUT) website</a>
</li>
  <li>read the European Commissionâ€™s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/slides_professional-qualifications-ip-justice-consumers_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">recognition of professional qualifications</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you hold a professional qualification that has already been recognised by an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country, it will still be valid after 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you have not had your professional qualifications recognised, you can submit an application under the current rules until 31 December 2020.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-norway">Studying in Norway</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Norway on or before 31 December 2020, your right to student finance will remain unchanged, as long as you remain resident in Norway.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>Social security coordination is covered by the Separation Agreement for those residing in Norway. Current healthcare arrangements will continue to apply in full to UK nationals who are resident in Norway before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, for as long as they remain in scope of the agreement. This includes students and S1 holders.</p>

<p>Make sure you are correctly registered for healthcare as a resident in Norway.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-norway" class="govuk-link">guidance on who is able to access healthcare in Norway and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll pay into the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme (NIS) through your income tax. The NIS covers basic medical services, although you will sometimes have to pay a small fee. Children under 16 get free medical care.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Norway and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-norway#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Norway, you must not use an EHIC from the UK to access healthcare in Norway.</p>

<p>When you travel from Norway for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. If youâ€™re travelling to other countries make sure you have comprehensive health insurance.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">checking your prescriptions are legal</a> in Norway</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only change your GP twice in a year. <a rel="external" href="http://paguro.net/destinations/moving-to-norway/all-documents-oslo/norway_oslo_doctor" class="govuk-link">Find English-speaking doctors and dentists in Norway</a>.</p>

<p>Ask your doctor about a <a rel="external" href="https://helsenorge.no/other-languages/english" class="govuk-link">health insurance receipt card</a> at your first GP visit.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Norway to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Norway have not changed.</p>

<p>You can read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk" class="govuk-link">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Norway. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/norway-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">Find an English-speaking lawyer in Norway</a>.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re working on the Norwegian continental shelf, itâ€™s compulsory to become member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. You must pay National Insurance contributions to Norway even if you donâ€™t pay taxes to Norway.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>
