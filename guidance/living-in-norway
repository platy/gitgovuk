<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/norway/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Norway</a>.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re staying in Norway for more than 3 months, you need to register with the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (<abbr title="Norwegian Directorate of Immigration">UDI</abbr>). Youâ€™ll need to <a rel="external" href="https://selfservice.udi.no/en-gb/">fill in a <abbr title="Norwegian Directorate of Immigration">UDI</abbr> application form and book an appointment</a>. You must bring the completed application and documents with you to the appointment.</p>

<p>You can also find information about the various types of residence permit that allow you to <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/">live and work in Norway on the <abbr title="Norwegian Directorate of Immigration">UDI</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re in Norway to work, at your registration appointment youâ€™ll need to show :</p>

<ul>
  <li>your completed application form</li>
  <li>valid ID card or passport</li>
  <li>an employment certificate completed by your employer (ansettelsesbevis) or an employment contract</li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re in Norway to study, at your registration appointment youâ€™ll need to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your completed application form</li>
  <li>valid ID card or passport</li>
  <li>confirmation of admission to an approved educational institution</li>
  <li>private health insurance or an European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</li>
  <li>a personal declaration stating that you can financially support yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for a residency permit at your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.sua.no/en">service centre for foreign workers (SUA)</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have your residency permit, you can apply for a Norwegian personal number from the local people register (Folkeregister). See more on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/">Norwegian Directorate of Immigration website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, UK nationals who plan to move to Norway after Brexit will need to apply for a residence permit.</p>

<p>Existing documents, including registration certificates and residence cards, will still be valid documentation of legal residence in Norway until new legislation enters into force.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, there will be no changes to the residency procedure until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Norway.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/norway">travel advice for Norway</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">need to renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> country, within a 180-day period. You must retain evidence of travel (such as train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> country, you will be able to transit through other EU, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> countries to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>If you live in Norway and you are planning to travel abroad, follow the  Norwegian government advice on <a rel="external" href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/european-policy/brits_brexit/id2630241/#qanda">extra documentation you will need to carry with you</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will be part of the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-norway">Driving in Norway</h2>

<p>You should exchange your UK licence for a Norwegian licence before the UK leaves the EU. You can still use your Norwegian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>Whilst the UK remains in the EU, UK licences can be exchanged for Norwegian ones without having to take a test.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prepare-to-drive-in-the-eu-after-brexit">driving after Brexit</a>.</p>

<p>The Norwegian government has proposed changes to their current regulation which would allow UK driving licences to continue to be exchanged for a Norwegian driving licence after Brexit in the same way as before. However, this new regulation may not be in place by the time the UK leaves the EU. You can read <a rel="external" href="https://www.vegvesen.no/fag/publikasjoner/Offentlige-hoeringer/Hoering?key=2625517">guidance on the Norwegian Public Roads Administration site</a> for more information in Norwegian on the consultation.</p>

<p>The Norwegian government has confirmed that <a rel="external" href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/brexit-norske-forerkort-vil-gjelde-i-storbritannia--arbeider-for-fulle-forerrettigheter-for-personer-med-britisk-forerkort-i-norge/id2632776/">travellers from the UK will not require an International Driving Permit after Brexit</a>.

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records check</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have a job offer, you need to apply for a personal number at your local police station or your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.sua.no/en/">service centre for foreign workers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-norway-after-brexit">Working in Norway after Brexit</h3>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/norway-providing-services-after-eu-exit">guidance on providing services after Brexit</a> if youâ€™re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>Make sure you are correctly registered for healthcare as a resident in Norway.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-norway/">NHS guidance on who is able to access healthcare in Norway and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll pay into the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme (NIS) through your income tax. The NIS covers basic medical services, although you will sometimes have to pay a small fee. Children under 16 get free medical care.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Norway and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Norway, you must not use a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Norway.</p>

<p>When you travel from Norway for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>

<p>Ask your doctor about a <a rel="external" href="https://helsenorge.no/other-languages/english">health insurance receipt card</a> at your first GP visit.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Norway.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK has reached an agreement with the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> states on citizensâ€™ rights if thereâ€™s no deal. The deal protects the rights of UK nationals living in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> states and will allow them to continue living their lives broadly as they do now.</p>

<p>Social security coordination is covered by the citizensâ€™ rights agreements for those residing in Norway. Current healthcare arrangements will continue to apply in full to UK nationals who are resident in Norway before Brexit for as long as they reside in Norway. This includes students and S1 holders.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re travelling to other countries make sure you have comprehensive health insurance.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-norway/">NHS guidance about healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Norway and how it may change after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Norway to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You can read our guidance on:</p>

<p>If youâ€™re working on the Norwegian continental shelf, itâ€™s compulsory to become member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. You must pay National Insurance contributions to Norway even if you donâ€™t pay taxes to Norway.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>
