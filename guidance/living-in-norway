<p>You may wish to check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/norway/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Norway</a></p>

<p>If you’re staying in Norway for more than 3 months, you need to register with the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI). You’ll need to <a rel="external" href="https://selfservice.udi.no/en-gb/">fill in an application form and book an appointment</a>. You have to bring the filled-in application and documents with you to the appointment.</p>

<p>You can also find information about the various types of residence permit that allow you to <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/">live and work in Norway via the UDI website</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re in Norway to work, you’ll need to show at your registration appointment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your filled-in application form</li>
  <li>valid ID card or passport</li>
  <li>an employment certificate filled in by your employer (ansettelsesbevis) or an employment contract</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re in Norway to study, you’ll need to show at your registration appointment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your filled-in application form</li>
  <li>valid ID card or passport</li>
  <li>confirmation of admission to an approved educational institution</li>
  <li>private health insurance or an European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</li>
  <li>a personal declaration stating that you can financially support yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for a residency permit at your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.sua.no/en">service centre for foreign workers (SUA)</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have your residency permit, you can apply for a Norwegian personal number from the local people register (Folkeregister). See <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/">Norwegian Directorate of Immigration</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, there will be no changes to the residency procedure until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, UK nationals who plan to move to Norway after the UK leaves the EU will need to apply for a residence permit. We will update this page as soon as information is available once the UK leaves the EU. For more information you can:</p>

</ul>

<p>Existing documents including registration certificates and a residence cards will still be valid documentation of legal residence in Norway until new legislation enters into force.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Norway. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/norway">travel advice for Norway</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will be part of the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national living in Norway and you are planning to travel out of Norway, you should follow the guidance provided on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/european-policy/brits_brexit/id2630241/">Norwegian Government advice page</a> (in English) on extra documentation you will need to carry with you.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You need to make sure you are correctly registered for healthcare as a resident in Norway.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-norway/">read the NHS’s guidance on who is able to access healthcare in Norway and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll pay into the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme (NIS) through your income tax. The NIS covers basic medical services, although you will sometimes have to pay a small fee. Children under 16 get free medical care.</p>

<p>If you live in Norway and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Norway, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Norway.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>

<p>Ask your doctor about a <a rel="external" href="https://helsenorge.no/other-languages/english">health insurance receipt card</a> at your first GP visit.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Norway.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK has reached an agreement with the EEA EFTA states on citizens’ rights in a no deal scenario. The deal protects the rights of UK nationals living in the EEA EFTA states and EEA EFTA nationals living in the UK if the UK leaves the EU without a deal and will enable them to continue living their lives broadly as they do now.</p>

<p>Social security coordination is covered by our citizens’ rights agreements for those residing in Norway. Current healthcare arrangements will continue to apply in full to UK nationals who are resident in Norway before UK leaves the EU, for as long as they reside in Norway. This includes students and S1 holders, but not those using an EHIC card as these are for temporary travel.</p>

<p>The UK is working to ensure UK issued EHIC cards will continue to be accepted in EEA EFTA states. However, this will not currently be the case in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. It is important that persons travelling always purchase comprehensive healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>You can read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-norway/">the NHS’s guidance about healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Norway and how it may change after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records check</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have a job offer, you need to apply for a personal number at your local police station or your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.sua.no/en/">service centre for foreign workers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Norway to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You can read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>

<p>If you’re working on the Norwegian continental shelf, it’s compulsory to become member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. You must pay national insurance contributions to Norway even if you don’t pay taxes to Norway.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the European Union will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Norway. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire to Norway, you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your UK State pension or new UK State Pension. Contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension Centre</a> to claim</li>
  <li>your pension from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/asd/organisation/departments/the-department-of-pension-policy/id975/">Norwegian Pension Department</a>, if you have worked in Norway</li>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">‘life certificate’ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible – your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay State pension, child benefits and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU. Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a> here.</p>

<p>Social security coordination is covered by our citizens’ rights agreements in both a deal and no deal scenario. Current pension arrangements will continue to apply in full to UK nationals who are resident in Norway before the UK leaves the EU for as long as they reside in Norway.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Norway. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our guidance on which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">benefits you can claim if you live, move or travel abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">check which benefits you can claim while abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit cannot be paid.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some Norwegian social security benefits after you’ve worked 6 months continually – <a rel="external" href="https://www.nav.no/en/Home/Benefits+and+services/Information+about+NAV+s+services+and+benefits">see Norwegian social security benefits</a>.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay State pension, child benefits and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU. Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario here</a>.</p>

<p>Social security coordination is covered by our citizens’ rights agreements in both a deal and no deal scenario. Current benefit arrangements will continue to apply in full to UK nationals who are resident in Norway before the UK leaves the EU for as long as they reside in Norway.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-norway">Driving in Norway</h2>

<p>You should exchange your UK licence for a Norwegian licence before the UK leaves the EU. You can still use your Norwegian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>Whilst we remain in the EU, UK licences can be exchanged for Norwegian ones without having to take a test.</p>

<p>The Norwegian government has proposed changes to their current regulation which would allow UK driving licences to continue to be exchanged for a Norwegian driving licence after the UK leaves the EU in the same way as before. However, this new regulation may not be in place by the time the UK leaves the EU.
