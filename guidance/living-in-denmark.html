<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national living in Denmark see our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Read <a href="https://familieretshuset.dk/en/your-life-situation/your-life-situation/custody-and-residence" rel="external" class="govuk-link">custody and residence of children in Denmark</a>.</p>

<h3>Residency</h3>

<p>If you were legally resident in Denmark before 1 January 2021 you must <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Brexit">apply for a new residence document</a> before 31 December 2021. The “How to apply” pages on the Danish government’s website lists the supporting documentation you need to provide.</p>

<p>After you’ve applied online, you will receive an invitation to book an appointment at <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Contact-us/Contact-SIRI/SIRI-branch-offices/">your nearest SIRI branch office</a> to have your photo taken and record your fingerprints.</p>

<p>Read the Danish government’s <a rel="external" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words-and-concepts/SIRI/Brexit/Brexit-Q-and-A" class="govuk-link">guidance on the new residence document and application procedure</a>. You should also read <a rel="external" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words-and-concepts/SIRI/Brexit/Brexit-Q-and-A" class="govuk-link">SIRI’s FAQs on residency.</a></p>

<h3>Moving to Denmark</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Denmark</a>
</li>
  <li>read the Danish government <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply">guidance on moving to Denmark</a>, including how to get a visa</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/theme/when-you-arrive" class="govuk-link">register with your local civil registration office</a> (Folkeregistret) once you have received your residency document. You will receive a Central Person Register (CPR) number</li>
  <li>register with the local Folkeregistret every time you change address</li>
</ul>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can apply for or renew your British passport from Denmark.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">Denmark travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/default/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr311126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU / European Free Trade Area (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Denmark using your EU / EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Denmark with a residence permit or long stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Denmark, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day long period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtensteing#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Denmark before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, especially within the Schengen area, carry your residence document or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residency document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Denmark, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is incorrectly stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement you do not need any extra months on your passport to enter or exit EU countries.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-denmark">Healthcare in Denmark</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>When you register with your local civil registration office (Folkeregistret) you will receive a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/healthcare">national health insurance card</a> (Sygesikringsbevis), which gives you access to free medical treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2">leaving the UK with medicine that contains a controlled drug</a>, check with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk" class="govuk-link">embassy</a> about the rules for the country you’re going to before you travel and the <a href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NaTHNaC guidance for travelling with medicines</a>.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Denmark before 1 January 2021</h3>

<h2>Working in Denmark</h2>

<p>If you are planning to move to Denmark and work, you may need a visa.</p>

<p>Read the Danish government’s guidance on working in Denmark as a foreign national and how to get a visa.</p>

<p>To apply for a job you may need to provide a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have registered residence in Denmark and have a Central Person Register (CPR) number, you should <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&amp;lang=us&amp;ik_navn=breadcrum">apply for an income tax card</a> (Skattekort). Your employer will need this card.</p>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>You may need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in Denmark.</p>

<p>Read guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/providing-services-to-any-country-in-the-eu-iceland-liechtenstein-norway-switzerland-after-eu-exit#recognition-of-professional-qualifications">recognition of professional qualifications</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>If you were living in Denmark before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If the relevant regulator in Denmark officially recognised your professional qualification before 1 January 2021, or you started the recognition process by this date, make sure you understand the terms of your recognition decision.
Seek advice from the regulator if needed.</p>

<h2>Money, tax and banking</h2>

<p>The UK has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/denmark-tax-treaties" class="govuk-link">double taxation agreement with Denmark</a> to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Once you have registered as a resident in Denmark and have a CPR number, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&amp;lang=us&amp;ik_navn=breadcrum" class="govuk-link">apply for an income tax card</a> - Skattekort. Your employer will need this card.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Denmark.  Find an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/denmark-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer</a> in Denmark.</p>

<h4>Value Added Tax (VAT) and customs charges</h4>
<p>If you regularly buy goods online or receive gifts from the UK, you need to be aware that these packages will, in most cases, be liable for Danish VAT (MOMS) and, in some cases, customs charges. Check the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://skat.dk.aspx?oid=2298798">guidance on online shopping</a>.</p>

<h4>National Insurance</h4>

<p>Find out if you need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">pay National Insurance in the UK or social security contributions</a> in Denmark.</p>

<h4>Declaring your assets</h4>

<p>When you move to Denmark, you have a duty <a href="https://skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=2244287" class="govuk-link" rel="external">to inform the Danish Tax Agency</a> (Skattestyrelsen) of any assets or savings you have abroad.</p>

<p>You will not be taxed on any savings or assets that you bring with you from abroad when moving to Denmark, but you may be taxed on interest income and any dividends.</p>

<h4>UK Banking</h4>

<p>Whether UK banks can provide services to customers living in the EEA depends on local laws and regulations.</p>
