<h2>If you were living in Denmark before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Denmark since before 1 January 2021.  You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section. You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizenâ€™s rights under the Withdrawal Agreement and the:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://nyindanmark.dk/" rel="external">Danish governmentâ€™s guidance for UK nationals in Denmark</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>You should follow the advice of the Danish government and your local authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark">Denmark travel advice </a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national living in Denmark, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>You should read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply" rel="external">Danish government visa guidance</a>. Your residence permit application is part of the visa process. If your application is successful you will be given a residence permit which shows this.</p>

<p>With your residence permit you must register with your local civil registration office (Folkeregistret). The Folkeregistret will give you a Central Person Register (CPR) number. You must register with the local Folkeregistret every time you move to another address.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Denmark before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you applied for your new residency document (opholdsdokument) by 31 December 2021, your rights are protected by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a> pending a decision on your application. You should continue the process to get your new residence card if you do not have it yet.</p>

<p>SIRI (the Danish Agency for International Recruitment and Integration) will contact you or your employer if they need further information. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-are-waiting-for-an-answer" rel="external">New to Denmark website</a> explains how long it will take for your residence application to be processed. If you have not had a response to your opholdsdokument application, phone the SIRI hotline on +45 72 14 20 05. It is available Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 9 am to 3 pm and Friday from 9 am to 12 noon.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>
<p>If your application is refused SIRI will notify you about the appeal process. Read the Danish government advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words-and-concepts/F%C3%A6lles/Appeals" rel="external">how to appeal a residency decision</a>.</p>

<h3>Late applications</h3>
<p>The deadline for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Brexit" rel="external">applying for a new residence status</a> was 31 December 2021. You can still apply, but SIRI will only consider late applications if you have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>If you have been granted an opholdsdokument, your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Denmark at any time in the future. Find more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>. They must travel to Denmark and then <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Brexit/Brexit---frist-overholdt-anden-ansoegning/Family-member-without-EU-stay" rel="external">submit an opholdsdokument application</a> as your family member.</p>

<p>Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Danish authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Denmark travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Denmark using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Denmark with a Danish residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Denmark, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day long period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. 
Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Denmark before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your opholdsdokument residence document or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residency document, show your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Denmark, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit your host country with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-denmark">Healthcare in Denmark</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>
