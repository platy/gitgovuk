<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://familieretshuset.dk/en/your-life-situation/your-life-situation/custody-and-residence" rel="external">custody and residence of children in Denmark</a>.</p>

<h3>Residency</h3>

<p>If you were legally resident in Denmark before 1 January 2021 you must <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply/Brexit">apply for a new residence document</a> before 31 December 2021. Make sure you read the “How to apply” pages before you start your application, they include list of supporting documentation you will need to provide.</p>

<p>Once you have applied online, you will receive an invitation to have your biometrics taken. You will need to book an appointment at <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Contact-us/Contact-SIRI/SIRI-branch-offices/">your nearest SIRI branch office</a></p>

<p>Read the Danish government’s <a href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words-and-concepts/SIRI/Brexit/Brexit-Q-and-A" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on the new residence document and application procedure</a>. You should also read <a href="https://nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/Words-and-concepts/SIRI/Brexit/Brexit-Q-and-A" rel="external" class="govuk-link">SIRI’s FAQs on residency.</a></p>

<p>All UK nationals must register with their local civil registration office (Folkeregistret). When you register you will get a Central Person Register (CPR) number. If you move house, you should make sure you re-register again at your new address.</p>

<h3>Moving to Denmark</h3>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/denmark/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Denmark</a>
</li>
  <li>read the Danish government <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply">guidance on moving to Denmark</a>, including how to get a visa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Denmark. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Denmark, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped. This will not affect your rights in Denmark.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Denmark, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before you book your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay for longer than 90 days in any 180-day period to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Driving in Denmark</h2>

<p>If you are a UK licence holder living in Denmark, you should <a href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/travel-and-transport/how-to-obtain-a-driving-license-in-denmark" class="govuk-link" rel="external">exchange your UK licence for a Danish one</a>.</p>

<p>If you are in Denmark and your UK driving licence is lost, stolen or expires you will not be able to renew it with the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You will need to apply to the DVLA for a ‘certificate of entitlement’ in Danish to be able to apply for a Danish driving licence.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Denmark, read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/travel-and-transport/how-to-obtain-a-driving-license-in-denmark">driving licence exchange and renewals</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>Driving in the UK with a Danish licence</h3>

<p>You can use your Danish licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test.</p>

<h3>Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Denmark</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>Read the Danish Customs and Tax Administration’s guidance on car registration rules and taxes in Denmark.</p>

<p>You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are legally resident in Denmark, you are entitled to treatment on the same basis as Danish insured citizens.</p>

<p>When you register with your local civil registration office (Folkeregistret) you will receive a <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/healthcare" class="govuk-link">national health insurance card</a> (Sygesikringsbevis), which gives you access to free medical treatment.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-denmark" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare for UK nationals living in Denmark</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Denmark temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-austria#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>Read the STPS guidance on <a href="https://stps.dk/da/eu-sygesikring/brexit" class="govuk-link" rel="external">access to healthcare and Danish EHICs after 31 December 2020</a> (in Danish).</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Denmark, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC for healthcare in Denmark.</p>

<p>If you were living in Denmark before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Denmark</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" class="govuk-link">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a>.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<p>For more information read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare when travelling in Europe</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#travel-eu">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>

<p>If you are registered for public healthcare as a resident before 1 January 2020, you will be able to use your Danish issued EHIC when you travel outside of Denmark until the end of the transition period.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>finding <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/denmark-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners" class="govuk-link">English-speaking doctors</a> in Denmark</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">checking your prescriptions are legal</a> in Denmark</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working in Denmark</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Denmark before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in an EU country</a> and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/">Life in Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have registered residence in Denmark and have a CPR number, you should <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&amp;lang=us&amp;ik_navn=breadcrum" class="govuk-link">apply for an income tax card</a> (Skattekort). Your employer will need this card.</p>

<p>If you are planning to come to Denmark to work, you may need a visa.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Denmark and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country, before 1 January 2021 you may need a permit to show that you are a frontier worker. You must also apply for the new residence document in Denmark.</p>

<p>If you live in the UK or another EU or EFTA country and regularly commuted to work in Denmark before 1 January 2021 you need a frontier worker document. Read the Danish government’s <a rel="external" href="https://uim.dk/brexit/brexit-how-does-it-affect-you-as-a-british-citizen-living-in-denmark" class="govuk-link">guidance on the new document and application procedure</a>.</p>

<h2>Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Danish nationals, as long as you were legally resident in Denmark before 1 January 2021. You must apply for the new residence document.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

<h3>Moving to Denmark to study</h3>

<p>For more information read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-european-union-after-brexit" class="govuk-link">studying in the European Union</a>.</p>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>You may need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in Denmark. When doing this, you will be subject to the third country regulations.</p>

<p>Read the Danish government <a rel="external" href="https://ufm.dk/en/education/recognition-and-transparency/regulated-professions/applications-under-eu-rules" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get your professional qualifications recognised</a>.</p>

<p>If your qualification was officially recognised by the relevant regulator in Denmark before 1 January 2021, make sure you understand the terms of your recognition decision by checking with that regulator.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>Denmark and the UK have a double taxation agreement to prevent income being taxed in both countries.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Denmark have not changed. You should send your questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>Once you have registered as a resident in Denmark and have a CPR number, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=3104&amp;lang=us&amp;ik_navn=breadcrum" class="govuk-link">apply for an income tax card</a> - Skattekort. Your employer will need this card.</p>

<h3>Declaration of overseas assets</h3>

<p>When you move to Denmark, you have a duty <a href="https://skat.dk/skat.aspx?oid=2244287" rel="external" class="govuk-link">to inform the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen)</a> of any assets or savings you have abroad.</p>

<p>You will not be taxed on any savings or assets that you bring with you from abroad when moving to Denmark, but you may be taxed on interest income and any dividends.</p>

If you have any concerns about whether you might be affected, contact your provider or seek independent financial advice.</p>
