<h2 id="if-youre-in-the-uk">If you’re in the UK</h2>

<p>You are expected to take all reasonable steps to leave the UK where it is possible to do so or apply to regularise your stay in the UK.</p>

<p>If you intend to leave the UK but have not been able to do so and you have a visa or leave that expires between 1 November and 30 November 2020 you may request additional time to stay, known as ‘exceptional assurance’, by <a rel="external" href="https://hsforms.smartcdn.co.uk/webform.html" class="govuk-link">completing the online form</a>.</p>

<p>If you are granted ‘exceptional assurance’ it will act as a short-term protection against any adverse action or consequences after your leave has expired. If conditions allowed you to work, study or rent accommodation you may continue to do so during the period of your exceptional assurance. Exceptional assurance does not grant you leave.</p>

<p>After you’ve completed the form, you’ll be told what you’ll need to submit to show why you can’t leave the UK.</p>

<p>For example, if you can’t leave the UK because you can’t find a flight before your leave/visa expires, you’ll need to submit a copy of a confirmed flight ticket. If you can’t leave the UK because you have coronavirus, you’ll need to submit confirmation of your positive coronavirus test result.</p>

<p>If you’ve already completed the form to request exceptional assurance and you’re waiting on the outcome, you do not need to email us or complete the form again. We are considering all requests and we will contact you to let you know the outcome. During this time, you will not be treated as an overstayer or suffer any detriment in any future immigration applications for this consideration period.</p>

<p>If you’ve already been given assurance but your circumstances have changed or you’re unable to leave the UK by the assurance date previously given, you must <a rel="external" href="https://hsforms.smartcdn.co.uk/webform.html" class="govuk-link">reapply through the online form</a>. You’ll need to clearly state that you’re making a subsequent application. You’ll be asked to provide new supporting evidence.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-intend-to-stay-in-the-uk-and-wish-to-regularise-your-stay">If you intend to stay in the UK and wish to regularise your stay</h3>

<p>If you decide to stay in the UK, you should apply for the necessary leave to remain in the UK. You’ll also be able to submit an application form from within the UK where you would usually need to apply for a visa from your home country.</p>

<p>You’ll need to meet the requirements of the route you’re applying for and pay the UK application fee.</p>

<p>The terms of your leave will remain the same until your application is decided. If you are switching into <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/work-visas" class="govuk-link">work</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/student-visas" class="govuk-link">study</a> routes you may be able to commence work or study whilst your application is under consideration.</p>

<h4 id="if-your-leave-expires-after-31-october-2020">If your leave expires after 31 October 2020</h4>

<p>You can submit an application form from within the UK where you would usually need to apply for a visa from your home country.</p>

<p>You’ll need to show your application is urgent, for example if you need to start a new job or course of study, please provide full details of this in a covering letter with your supporting documents.</p>

<p>You’ll need to pay the fees and meet all requirements of your visa as normal, except the need to submit the application in your home country.</p>

<p>This is being kept under review.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-have-overstayed-your-leave">If you have overstayed your leave</h3>

<p>If your visa or leave expired between 24 January 2020 and 31 August 2020 there will be no future adverse immigration consequences if you didn’t make an application to regularise your stay during this period. However, if you have not applied to regularise your stay or submitted a request for an exceptional assurance you must make arrangements to leave the UK.</p>

<h3 id="application-and-service-centres-in-the-uk">Application and Service Centres in the UK</h3>

<p>Most UK Visa and Citizenship Application Centres (<abbr title="UK Visa and Citizenship Application Centres">UKVCAS</abbr>) have reopened for existing customers. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/ukvcas" class="govuk-link">check which <abbr title="UK Visa and Citizenship Application Centres">UKVCAS</abbr> centres are open</a> and book an appointment if you have not already done so.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Visa and Citizenship Application Centres">UKVCAS</abbr> Service Points are essential services and will remain open throughout the UK so customers can continue to book and attend appointments to progress their visa applications.</p>

<p>Service and Support Centres (SSCs) are essential services and will remain open. SSCs are offering a reduced number of appointments because of coronavirus. As more appointments are made available <a href="https://www.gov.uk/visas-and-immigration-service-and-support-centres" class="govuk-link">UKVI will invite you to arrange an appointment by email or post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="if-youre-a-student-or-child-student-applicant-in-the-uk-and-have-given-your-fingerprints-before">If you’re a Student or Child Student applicant in the UK and have given your fingerprints before</h3>

<p>If you’re applying in the UK as a Student or Child Student (including Tier 4 student), UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) may be able to reuse your fingerprints.</p>

<p>If UKVI can reuse the fingerprints you’ve already given, you’ll be emailed with instructions on how to send them an image of your face and your supporting documents.</p>

<p>This will mean you do not have to attend a <abbr title="UK Visa and Citizenship Application Centres">UKVCAS</abbr> or an <abbr title="Service and Support Centres">SSC</abbr> service point appointment to provide biometric information.</p>

<p>If you cannot send the information through the instructions given, you’ll be able to book an appointment.</p>

<p>You no longer need to employ at least 2 people for 12 consecutive months. The 12 month period you’re required to employ someone for can be made up of multiple jobs across different months.</p>

<p>Time when your employees were furloughed will not count towards the 12 month period.</p>

<p>If you’ve not been able to employ staff for 12 months by the time your visa expires, you’ll be allowed to temporarily extend your stay to give you time to meet the requirement.</p>

<p>These arrangements will continue for applications made after 31 May 2020, where the jobs you’re relying on were disrupted due to coronavirus.</p>

<p>If you’re unable to travel back to the UK due to coronavirus travel restrictions and your leave has expired, a short break in continuous residence will be overlooked. You are expected to make your next application as soon as possible.</p>

<p>There will be no future adverse immigration consequences if there has been a short break of continuous residence if your leave expired between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020. However, if you did not make a valid application to stay by 31 August 2020, you must now make arrangements to leave the UK.</p>

<p>If you intend to leave the UK but have not been able to do so and you have a visa or leave that expires between 1 November and 30 November 2020 you may request additional time to stay, known as ‘exceptional assurance’, by <a rel="external" href="https://hsforms.smartcdn.co.uk/webform.html" class="govuk-link">completing the online form</a>.</p>

<p>If your leave expires after 31 October 2020, you can make your application from inside the UK where you would usually need to apply for a visa from your home country if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your application is urgent, for example if you have a family emergency and cannot apply from outside the UK</li>
  <li>you cannot apply from outside the UK due to coronavirus</li>
</ul>

<p>This is being kept under review.</p>

<p>If you’re here with 6 months’ leave as a fiancé, fiancée or proposed civil partner and your wedding or civil ceremony has been delayed due to coronavirus you may request additional time to stay, also known as ‘exceptional assurance’, by <a rel="external" href="https://hsforms.smartcdn.co.uk/webform.html" class="govuk-link">completing the online form</a> and providing evidence of when your wedding will take place.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can apply to extend your stay for a further 6 months to allow the ceremony to take place.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-the-minimum-income-and-adequate-maintenance-requirement">Changes to the minimum income and adequate maintenance requirement</h3>

<p>If you’ve experienced a loss of income due to coronavirus up to 1 January 2021, we will consider employment income for the period immediately before the loss of income, provided the minimum income requirement was met for at least 6 months immediately before the date the income was lost.</p>

<p>If your salary has reduced because you’re furloughed we will take account of your income as though you’re earning 100% of your salary.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, a loss of annual income due to coronavirus between 1 March 2020 and 1 January 2021 will usually be disregarded, along with the impact on employment income from the same period for future applications.</p>

<h3 id="if-youre-unable-to-provide-specified-documents">If you’re unable to provide specified documents</h3>

<p>In some cases, we will be able to decide your application without seeing certain specified documents if you cannot get them due to coronavirus. Otherwise, you may be asked to submit the specified documents after the date of application.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-the-english-language-requirement">Changes to the English language requirement</h3>

<p>If you’re asked to take an English language test as part of your application, you can apply for an exemption if the test centre was closed or you couldn’t travel to it due to coronavirus when you applied.</p>
