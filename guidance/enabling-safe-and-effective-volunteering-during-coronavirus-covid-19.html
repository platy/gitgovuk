<p>This guidance is for people who run volunteer-involving organisations or groups, or manage volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering yourself, or are already volunteering, read guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/volunteering/coronavirus-volunteering">how to volunteer during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a>.</p>
</div>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>This guidance applies to England. There is different guidance on volunteering in <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/volunteering-during-coronavirus-pandemic">Wales</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://ready.scot/coronavirus/volunteering" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a> and <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-staying-safe-when-helping-others" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Plan B: upcoming changes</strong></p>

<p>The government has announced that the measures put in place under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-autumn-and-winter-plan-2021/covid-19-response-autumn-and-winter-plan-2021#plan-b" class="govuk-link">Plan B</a> in England will be lifted.</p>

<p>This means that people are no longer asked to work or volunteer from home if they can. People should talk to their employers and volunteering organisations to agree arrangements to return.</p>

<p>From 27 January:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There will no longer be a legal requirement for people to wear face coverings. People are still advised to wear one in crowded and indoor spaces where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet.</li>
  <li>Venues and events will no longer be required by law to check the COVID status of their customers. They can still choose to use the NHS COVID Pass on a voluntary basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance will be updated shortly to include more information on these changes. You should continue to follow all of the guidance on this page to keep yourself and others safe.</p>
</div>

<p>COVID-19 will be a feature of our lives for the foreseeable future, so we need to learn to live with it and manage the risk to ourselves and others.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, organisations and groups need to make judgements to manage the risks of coronavirus. While no situation is risk free, there are actions that can be taken to limit transmission of the virus.</p>

<h2>Who can volunteer</h2>

<p>Anyone can volunteer during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Volunteers must not physically attend their role when they are legally required to stay at home. This includes volunteers who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have tested positive for COVID-19</li>
  <li>have been told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace</li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteers who have COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate immediately and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">take a PCR test</a> as soon as possible. If this test is positive, volunteers should stay at home and continue to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Anyone aged 5 years and over who lives in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">same household as someone with COVID-19</a> and who is not legally required to self-isolate is now strongly advised to take an LFD test every day for 7 days. If any of these LFD tests are positive they should self-isolate in order to protect other people.</p>

<p>Organisations and volunteers can find more information about self-isolation in the guidance for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">people who live with someone who has or might have COVID-19</a></li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">people who have been in contact with someone with a positive test result for COVID-19 who do not live with that person</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following expert clinical advice and the successful rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine programme, people previously considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) will not be advised to shield again. People who were previously identified as CEV are advised to continue to follow the guidance contained in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus: how to stay safe and help prevent the spread</a>. Individuals should consider advice from their health professional on whether additional precautions are right for them.</p>

<h2>Business and venues</h2>

<p>Organisations and groups have a duty to manage risks to those affected by their business or venue(s). This means carrying out a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/risk-assessment.htm">health and safety risk assessment</a>, including the risks relating to COVID-19, and taking reasonable steps to mitigate the risks identified. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Working safely guidance</a> sets out a range of mitigations organisations and groups should consider, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying poorly-ventilated areas in the venue and taking steps to improve air flow</li>
  <li>cleaning surfaces that people touch regularly</li>
  <li>ensuring that volunteers who are unwell do not attend the workplace</li>
  <li>communicating to volunteers the measures you have put in place</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact tracing and mandatory certification</h2>

<p>Organisations are no longer legally required to collect customer contact details, but doing so will support NHS Test and Trace to contact those who may have been exposed to COVID-19 so that they can book a test.</p>

<p>Organisations are encouraged to continue displaying <a href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster" class="govuk-link">QR codes</a> for customers wishing to check in using the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<p>To support NHS Test and Trace, organisations and groups should keep a record of all volunteers who come onto their premises, including their shift times on a given day and their contact details.</p>

<h2>COVID status checks for certain venues and events</h2>

<p>In line with Plan B measures, organisations are legally required to monitor COVID status certification for entry into nightclubs and settings where large crowds gather.</p>

<p>Adult volunteers in venues or events which require <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prove-your-coronavirus-covid-19-status-to-work-at-venues-or-events-operating-covid-19-status-checks">evidence of COVID status</a> for visitors, you should be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fully vaccinated with 2 doses of an approved vaccine (or one of the single-dose Janssen vaccine). This does not currently extend to boosters.</li>
  <li>exempt from vaccination (for medical reasons or because you participated in a COVID vaccine trial)</li>
  <li>undertaking regular lateral flow testing, or</li>
  <li>an exempt person (conducting their official duties)</li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteers at a venue or event that requires evidence of your COVID status for visitors but not in a role that does not come into contact with customers do not need to show evidence of vaccination or testing.</p>

<p>More <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/covid-19-response/using-the-nhs-covid-pass/">detailed guidance on using the NHS COVID Pass</a> is available for workers and organisations.</p>

<h2>Travelling to volunteer or while volunteering</h2>

<p>People wishing to travel into another nation in the UK to volunteer need to check the restrictions of that nation before doing so. Read guidance on coronavirus restrictions in <a href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>People can leave the UK to volunteer but should check:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/travel-abroad" class="govuk-link">guidance on international travel</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">if the country you’re going to is accepting travellers and / or volunteers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules" class="govuk-link">if your volunteering role is exempt from current travel restrictions</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">the rules you must follow when you return to England</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">People must wear a face covering by law in many public places</a>, unless they have a reasonable excuse for not wearing one (for example, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">if they have an illness, impairment or a disability</a>).</p>

<p>Volunteers in other indoor areas where a face covering is not legally required, should continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with other people they do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Settings in which face coverings are required must display signage or take other measures to ensure customers are aware of the requirement to wear a face covering on their premises where there is no applicable exemption or reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>Some volunteers may be exempt from wearing face coverings, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>police officers and emergency response volunteers when they are on duty</li>
  <li>a coach of an elite sportsperson or referee when in the course of providing these services</li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteers must not be prevented from wearing a face covering if they wish to.</p>

<h2>Booster vaccines</h2>

<p>Everyone aged over 18 is now being offered a booster dose of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. Volunteers can book online or call 119 to make an appointment.</p>

<h2>Vaccination as a condition of deployment in health and social care settings</h2>

<p>From 11 November 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccination-of-people-working-or-deployed-in-care-homes-operational-guidance">anyone working or volunteering in a care home will need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>, unless exempt.</p>

<p>Booster doses are not currently included in the regulations, but managers are strongly advised to encourage volunteers to take up booster vaccines if eligible.</p>

<p>Those volunteering in wider health and social care settings may also need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus (COVID-19) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-introduce-covid-19-vaccination-as-a-condition-of-deployment-for-all-frontline-health-and-social-care-workers" class="govuk-link">from April 2022</a>.</p>

<h2>Ensuring volunteers and their workplaces are safe</h2>

<p>Organisations and groups have a duty of care to volunteers to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety.</p>

<p>Organisations and groups should <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/risk-assessment.htm" class="govuk-link">assess the risks</a> around volunteering roles and activities and take steps to keep volunteers safe. Your organisation or group should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take steps to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in line with <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">HSE guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>consider how <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19" class="govuk-link">working safely guidance</a> might apply to your organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations and groups may want to encourage volunteers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take regular rapid lateral flow tests, even if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>get vaccinated</li>
  <li>wash their hands regularly and for 20 seconds</li>
  <li>make sure indoor spaces are well ventilated with fresh air, or meet outdoors where possible</li>
  <li>consider wearing a face covering in enclosed and crowded settings where they come into contact with people they do not normally meet</li>
  <li>be aware that not everyone will want close contact with others</li>
  <li>minimise the number of contacts they have with people from outside of their household</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations and groups should read guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">working safely during coronavirus</a>. This guidance relates to several areas of work where volunteers are often involved. Volunteers should have the same level of protection for their health and safety as others, including workers and clients.</p>

<p>There is also guidance on other settings which may be relevant, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship">the safe use of places of worship</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-public-places-managing-public-outdoor-settings" class="govuk-link">public outdoor settings</a>. The Health and Safety Executive has published <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/voluntary/index.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on managing risk for voluntary organisations</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Safeguarding volunteers</h2>

<p>Your organisation or group should think carefully about how it safeguards its volunteers and everyone who comes into contact with them. Volunteers should be recognised throughout your organisation or group’s safeguarding policies. Safeguarding should also be considered throughout your policies relating to volunteers.</p>

<h2>Insurance and volunteers</h2>

<p>You should carefully consider which type of insurance cover you need to protect your volunteers and your organisation or group. Read <a href="https://beta.ncvo.org.uk/help-and-guidance/involving-volunteers/planning-for-volunteers/getting-volunteer-insurance/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NCVO guidance on insurance and volunteers</a>.</p>

<p>Volunteer drivers who are helping those in need during the pandemic do not need to contact their insurer to update their documents or extend their cover. Read <a href="https://www.abi.org.uk/news/news-articles/2020/03/information-for-volunteers-using-their-car-to-help-fight-coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on insurance for volunteer drivers</a> from the Association of British Insurers (ABI).</p>

<h2>Volunteers who claim benefits</h2>

<p>People who receive benefits can volunteer while receiving their benefits, as long as they continue to meet all the conditions of the benefit they get. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/volunteering-and-claiming-benefits">guidance on volunteering and claiming benefits</a>.</p>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (‘furlough’) has now closed.</p>
