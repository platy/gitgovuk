<p>This guidance is for people who run volunteer-involving organisations or groups, or manage volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering yourself, or are already volunteering, read guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/volunteering/coronavirus-volunteering">how to volunteer during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a>.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This guidance applies to England. There is different guidance on volunteering in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/volunteering-during-coronavirus-pandemic" rel="external">Wales</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ready.scot/coronavirus/volunteering" rel="external">Scotland</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-staying-safe-when-helping-others" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Plan for living with COVID-19:</strong></p>

<p>The government has published its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-living-with-covid-19">plan for living with COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>From February 24:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>People will no longer be legally required to self-isolate if they test positive for COVID-19. New guidance will advise people who test positive to stay at home and avoid contact with other people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People will no longer be legally required to self-isolate if they are unvaccinated and a close contact of someone with COVID-19. Fully vaccinated close contacts will no longer be advised to test for 7 days. New guidance will set out precautions for reducing risk to yourself and others.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance will be updated shortly to include more information on these changes.</p>
</div>

<p>COVID-19 will be a feature of our lives for the foreseeable future, so we need to learn to live with it and manage the risk to ourselves and others.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, organisations and groups need to make judgements to manage the risks of coronavirus. While no situation is risk free, there are actions that can be taken to limit transmission of the virus.</p>

<h2>Who can volunteer</h2>

<p>Anyone can volunteer during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Volunteers must not physically attend their role when they are legally required to stay at home. This includes volunteers who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have tested positive for COVID-19</li>
  <li>have been told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace</li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteers who have COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate immediately and take a PCR test as soon as possible. If this test is positive, volunteers must stay at home and continue to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Organisations and volunteers can find more information about self-isolation in the guidance for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">households who have or might have COVID-19</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">people who have been in contact with someone with a positive test result for COVID-19 who do not live with that person</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations can take action to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 in the workplace</a>. Volunteers who are self-isolating should not be allowed to attend in person.</p>

<p>People previously considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) will not be advised to shield again. People who were previously identified as CEV are advised to continue to follow the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">how to stay safe and help prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>. They can also review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance for people previously considered clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19</a> including extra precautions they may wish to take. Individuals should consider advice from their health professional on whether additional precautions are right for them.</p>

<h2>Business and venues</h2>

<p>Organisations and groups have a duty to manage risks to those affected by their business or venue(s). This means carrying out a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/risk-assessment.htm" rel="external">health and safety risk assessment</a>, including the risks relating to COVID-19, and taking reasonable steps to mitigate the risks identified. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">Working safely guidance</a> sets out a range of mitigations organisations and groups should consider, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying poorly-ventilated areas in the venue and taking steps to improve air flow</li>
  <li>cleaning surfaces that people touch regularly</li>
  <li>ensuring that volunteers who are unwell do not attend the workplace</li>
  <li>communicating to volunteers the measures you have put in place</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact tracing and volunteer records</h2>

<p>Organisations can choose to display an NHS QR code so that customers can check in using the NHS COVID-19 app. This is not required, however it will help NHS Test and Trace to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">NHS QR codes</a>.</p>

<p>To support NHS Test and Trace, organisations and groups should keep a record of all volunteers who come onto their premises, including their shift times on a given day and their contact details. This personal data must be handled in accordance with data protection legislation to protect the privacy of your staff, customers and visitors. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">keeping records for NHS Test and Trace</a>.</p>

<h2>COVID status checks and the domestic NHS COVID Pass</h2>

<p>It is no longer mandatory for events and venues to check the COVID-19 status of staff, volunteers and attendees in England. However, venues where large crowds gather or are in close contact may choose to check the COVID-19 status of attendees and volunteers to keep them safer, for example, by using the NHS COVID Pass as a condition of entry.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carrying-out-mandatory-covid-19-status-checks-at-your-venue-or-event">guidance on COVID-19 status checks</a> for more information. More <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/covid-19-response/using-the-nhs-covid-pass/" rel="external">detailed guidance on using the NHS COVID Pass</a> is available for workers and organisations.</p>

<h2>Travelling to volunteer or while volunteering</h2>

<p>People wishing to travel into another nation in the UK to volunteer need to check the restrictions of that nation before doing so. Read guidance on coronavirus restrictions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" rel="external">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>People who are travelling internationally to volunteer but should check:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/travel-abroad">guidance on international travel</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">if the country youâ€™re going to is accepting travellers and / or volunteers</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules">if your volunteering role is exempt from current travel restrictions</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>The government suggests that people continue to wear <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">face coverings</a> in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with other people they do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Volunteers should not be prevented from wearing a face covering if they wish to.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">guidance on face coverings</a> for more information</p>

<h2>Booster vaccines</h2>

<p>Everyone aged 16 and over is now being offered a booster dose of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. Volunteers can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-booster-vaccine/" rel="external">book an appointment online using the NHS website</a> or call 119 to make an appointment.</p>

<h2>Vaccination as a condition of deployment in health and social care settings</h2>

<p>From 11 November 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccination-of-people-working-or-deployed-in-care-homes-operational-guidance">anyone working or volunteering in a care home will need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>, unless exempt.</p>

<p>Booster doses are not currently included in the regulations, but managers are strongly advised to encourage volunteers to take up booster vaccines if eligible.</p>

<p>Those volunteering in wider health and social care settings may also need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus (COVID-19) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-introduce-covid-19-vaccination-as-a-condition-of-deployment-for-all-frontline-health-and-social-care-workers">from April 2022</a>.</p>

<h2>Ensuring volunteers and their workplaces are safe</h2>

<p>Organisations and groups have a duty of care to volunteers to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, they are not exposed to risks to their health and safety.</p>

<p>Organisations and groups should assess the risks around volunteering roles and activities and take steps to keep volunteers safe. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/risk-assessment.htm" rel="external">Health and Safety Executiveâ€™s guidance on how to assess risks during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>Your organisation or group should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take steps to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm" rel="external">HSE guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>consider how <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">working safely guidance</a> might apply to your organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations and groups may want to encourage volunteers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take regular rapid lateral flow tests, even if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" rel="external">Find out how to order rapid lateral flow tests</a>)</li>
  <li>get vaccinated (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine/" rel="external">Find out more about COVID-19 vaccines</a>)</li>
  <li>wash their hands regularly with soap and water or use hand sanitiser regularly throughout the day</li>
  <li>make sure indoor spaces are well ventilated with fresh air, or meet outdoors where possible</li>
  <li>consider wearing a face covering in enclosed and crowded settings where they come into contact with people they do not normally meet</li>
  <li>be aware that not everyone will want close contact with others</li>
  <li>minimise the number of contacts they have with people from outside of their household</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations and groups should read guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">working safely during coronavirus</a>. This guidance relates to several areas of work where volunteers are often involved. Volunteers should have the same level of protection for their health and safety as others, including workers and clients.</p>

<p>There is also guidance on other settings which may be relevant, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship">the safe use of places of worship</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-public-places-managing-public-outdoor-settings">public outdoor settings</a>. The Health and Safety Executive has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/voluntary/index.htm" rel="external">guidance on managing risk for voluntary organisations</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Safeguarding volunteers</h2>

<p>Your organisation or group should think carefully about how it safeguards its volunteers and everyone who comes into contact with them. Volunteers should be recognised throughout your organisation or groupâ€™s safeguarding policies. Safeguarding should also be considered throughout your policies relating to volunteers.</p>

<h2>Insurance and volunteers</h2>

<p>You should carefully consider which type of insurance cover you need to protect your volunteers and your organisation or group. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://beta.ncvo.org.uk/help-and-guidance/involving-volunteers/planning-for-volunteers/getting-volunteer-insurance/" rel="external">NCVO guidance on insurance and volunteers</a>.</p>

<p>Volunteer drivers who are helping those in need during the pandemic do not need to contact their insurer to update their documents or extend their cover. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.abi.org.uk/news/news-articles/2020/03/information-for-volunteers-using-their-car-to-help-fight-coronavirus" rel="external">guidance on insurance for volunteer drivers</a> from the Association of British Insurers (ABI).</p>

<h2>Volunteers who claim benefits</h2>

<p>People who receive benefits can volunteer while receiving their benefits, as long as they continue to meet all the conditions of the benefit they get. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/volunteering-and-claiming-benefits">guidance on volunteering and claiming benefits</a>.</p>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (â€˜furloughâ€™) has now closed.</p>
