<h2><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/i-vms-frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Legislation is due to come into force which will make it a legal requirement for all vessels under 12 metres in length to have an inshore vessel monitoring system (I-VMS) installed and transmitting data to the MMO when they are at sea in English waters. This is part of the Government’s strategy to improve data collection to support development of more responsive fisheries management measures and practices that will enable industry to benefit from leaving the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>

<p>I-VMS is similar to VMS tracking devices utilised by fishing vessels 12 metres and greater in overall length. It provides positional information such as latitude and longitude, course, speed and date and time of each positional report. However, rather than transmitting data via satellite, which can become expensive, it reports its data via mobile phone signal (GPRS). This is a cheaper alternative, and the frequency of reports can be set at a higher level. When the device is located outside GPRS range, the device will continue to store the positional information and submit the data once GPRS coverage next becomes available. This data will be sent to the MMO UK VMS Hub.</p>

<p>Data derived from I-VMS will provide a more complete picture of all fishing in our seas. Combined with data on catch volumes, scientific evidence of stock levels and a range of other significant data, I-VMS will enable more efficient decisions on local and national management measures and policies. It will also enable the MMO to continually improve its targeted assurance activities as the clearer picture of fishing activity will help highlight which vessels are consistently complying with regulations on where and what they can fish, and those that may introduce risk to sustainable sea fisheries.</p>

<p>When the legislation comes into force (currently expected in late 2022) it will be the fisher’s responsibility to ensure that they have a device fitted and that it is transmitting. If a device is not fitted to the vessel and transmitting, they will not be able to fish lawfully. The MMO is not responsible for ensuring that fishers are ready but, as a responsible regulator, is facilitating preparations through type approval, grant funding and a staged rollout, so every fisher can be compliant and delivery demands are spread across 2022.</p>

<h3>For the attention of fishers that intend to operate within Welsh Waters from 2022</h3>

<p>The MMO strongly encourage any English under 12m fishers who intend to operate in Welsh waters (at any stage of their operation), to purchase an MMO approved I-VMS device as an upmost priority, in order not to be impacted by the introduction of the Welsh I-VMS Statutory Instrument (SI).</p>

<p>Welsh I-VMS measures are set to be introduced early 2022, meaning that if a fisher on an under 12metre vessel does not operate an I-VMS device when in Welsh waters, they will be in breach of their regulation.</p>

<p>If you feel that you might be affected and you are unsure what to do please contact us via the I-VMS mailbox <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:IVMS@marinemanagement.org.uk">IVMS@marinemanagement.org.uk</a> and we will help guide you.</p>

<p>Please note the I-VMS grant funding payment will be processed in alignment with the wider national I-VMS rollout timetable, where claims can be processed from February onwards.</p>

<h2>Device type approval</h2>

<p>The MMO invited potential suppliers to participate in the type approval process to identify devices that met the minimum I-VMS technical specification, ensuring such products are suitable within the marine environment, provide a high level of positional accuracy (to within ten metres) and deliver reliable frequency of data transmission using GPRS (e.g., mobile phone signal) to the MMO.</p>

<p>This type approval process was designed to deliver a broad choice of I-VMS devices that meet the technical specifications for English fishers to select from, understanding that potentially one product may not be suitable for every single vessel type. Further information on the 2021 I-VMS type approval process (now closed) is available  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/i-vms-type-approval-programme">I-VMS type approval programme - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a></p>

<p>To allow fishers a choice of suppliers and devices this approach differs from a normal procurement process. Therefore, the MMO has no contract or other affiliation with the suppliers and there is no contract or liability between the MMO and the fisher in relation to the device. The MMO has simply assessed the devices only and whether these devices have the appropriate technical capability. Suppliers provided written evidence detailing how their products meet each specification of requirement. Suppliers also had to present a number certifications including IP rating, UKCA /EC marking and EMC. In addition, test result were required against a set methodology to evidence positional accuracy, power management, obstruction/blackout handling and their tamper resistance. This replaced the requirement for MMO to conduct physical device testing. As the type approval approach is specific to assessing devices only, no assessments are on the company’s status (financial, environment etc.) are made.</p>

<p>The list of I-VMS type approved products and their suppliers are below and on the official <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-i-vms-type-approved-devices-for-under-12-metre-english-vessels">I-VMS approval list website</a></p>

<h2>Approved devices</h2>

<p>The following devices meet the I-VMS specification of requirements set out in the MMO’s type approval process. These approved I-VMS devices will deliver the required level of data to the MMO, through the UK VMS Hub. All products are designed for the marine field.</p>

<h2>Rollout timeline</h2>

<p>To allow the opportunity for all under 12 metre English vessels the ability to purchase and install an I-VMS approved device onto their vessel prior to legislation coming into force, the following rollout schedule has been set out to allow a phased order according to vessel size. This system of tranches has been designed to make rolling out devices to more than 2000 vessels smoother by offering a framework to manage the flow of demand from fishers.</p>

<p>Fishers are requested to purchase and install a device in alignment with the rollout timetable below. All devices must be installed and operational before the introduction of the I-VMS Statutory Instrument (SI) scheduled for late 2022.</p>

<p>Fishers are requested to adhere to the proposed schedule – failure to do so will risk supplier capacity to fit and test devices and may result in delays to grant payments. Fishers need to ensure that they have made decisions on their preferred device in advance of their tranche to ensure that they have a device fitted ahead of the legislation coming into force.</p>

<p>The opportunity for financial support through grant finding will be limited to the tranche windows. Any vessel that does not have an I-VMS approved device installed and working by the time the requirements come into force, will not be able to lawfully fish.</p>

<p>It has been agreed to allocate a specific, local roll-out in the national IVMS project timetable for all vessels that currently have an IVMS device fitted under the requirements of the Devon &amp; Severn IFCA Mobile Fishing Permit Byelaw. AST Ltd have chosen not to participate in the national IVMS project.  Owners of vessels under 12 metres in length that have AST devices installed will need to choose a new, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-i-vms-type-approved-devices-for-under-12-metre-english-vessels">MMO type approved IVMS device</a></p>

<p>All other owners of vessel under 12 metres in length that currently have an IVMS device fitted under the requirements of the Devon &amp; Severn IFCA Mobile Fishing Permit Byelaw can choose to buy and install a replacement MMO type approved IVMS device. If fishers decide they want or need to change their current IVMS device, then the rollout period will be from October 3 – 30 2022.</p>

<p>All other vessel owners within Devon and Severn IFCA’s District without an IVMS device installed on their under 12m vessels, are advised to follow the national tranche deadlines for installation and grant applications. However, if you wish to fish under the requirements of the Devon &amp; Severn IFCA Mobile Fishing Permit Byelaw and have no IVMS device currently onboard you can apply to purchase and install an IVMS device earlier than the national tranche roll out periods.</p>

<p>As part of this programme fishers in this area are reminded;</p>

<p>•	The Maritime System’s device is reinstated to the list of  approved devices  List of I-VMS type approved devices for under 12 metre English vessels - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)
•	Vessels with AST devices on board will have to choose another supplier, as  AST chose not to submit their device for test approval in the national IVMS project 
•	The Devon &amp; Severn roll-out is Oct 3 – 30 October but fishers can apply for grant support earlier from the national project if they choose to and arrange earlier purchase and installation</p>

<h2>Selecting a device, agreeing contracts, and arranging fitting</h2>

<p>Fishers need to determine which device, supplier and service/support provisions are best for them.</p>

<p>General guidance around contract application can be found below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consumer rights - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-write-fair-contracts">* How to write fair contracts: information for businesses - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extended-warranties-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-buy">* Extended warranties: what you need to know before you buy - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid unfair terms in sales contracts: Implied and statutory rights - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</li>
</ul>

<h3>When considering the device and supplier, fishers need to determine</h3>

<ul>
  <li>where to locate and secure the device to their vessel. All devices have the capability to be attached onto the structure of a vessel, including on bar frames. Speak to suppliers.</li>
  <li>whether the device will be connected to the vessel’s onboard electrics or whether it is to be operated using the device alternative power options independent from the vessel.</li>
  <li>what service, support and warranty packages are attached with the device?</li>
  <li>how the supplier intends to resolve matters if a fault arise on their device. Also, the availability and distance of their engineers for installs.</li>
  <li>note that I-VMS funding can be claimed (up to £650 per vessel). See ‘claiming I-VMS funding’ section</li>
</ul>

<p>We advise fishers to have these discussions with suppliers. The suppliers can then understand what is important to you and what considerations are required to enable a device to be fitted on to your vessel.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that fishers will be signing a contract with their chosen device supplier. Therefore, fishers need to negotiate and understand what service and support package best suits them.</p>

<p>To note the frequency of I-VMS data will be set at a rate of every three minutes when in English waters. This will be laid out within the legislation. The annual airtime for fishers is around £120 to £180 per year.  In addition, English fishers will continue to report data at this rate when outside English waters.  As the devices use mobile phone technology, fishers should ensure their chosen device can report at 4G.</p>

<p>Once fishers have determined which device and supplier they have chosen and have agreed contracts, then both parties (fisher and supplier) will agree a suitable I-VMS device installation date.</p>

<h2>Claiming I-VMS funding</h2>

<p>Once fishers have their I-VMS device installed and confirmed operational either by the engineer or supplier fishers can commence the grant claim process. The grant claim process is expected to open from February 2022 at the start of tranche 1 (see rollout timeline).</p>

<p>Fishers will be able to claim up to £650 per vessel through the MMO grant reclaim process that goes towards purchasing a device and the initial installation costs. Evidence of purchase and payment will be required to complete this process. Part of the general funding terms and conditions attached to the grant payments, is that the device must meet a five-year durability of operation. This means when claiming, the device should then be operational on the claimant’s vessel for at least five years, otherwise a percentage of the funding may need to be returned.</p>

<h3>VAT consideration when purchasing and applying for funding.</h3>

<p>Fishers who are not VAT-registered will be able to claim the cost of the product and VAT up to a limit of £650. Fishers who are VAT-registered will be able to claim just the cost of the product, not the VAT, subject to the limit for the grant of £650</p>

<p>Further information regarding on how to claim, including the grant terms and conditions will be communicated in January on our I-VMS web pages as well as in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/commercial-fishing-fisheries/funding">commercial fisheries funding pages</a></p>

<p>Claims and associated paperwork should be submitted within 30 days after installation in order assist with the funding reimbursement process. If a fisher has purchased and installed a device ahead of their tranche dates, reimbursement payment to the fishers may be prioritised to fishers in the current tranche and therefore potentially subject to a delay in issuing.</p>

<h2>Breakdowns or faults</h2>

<p>The MMO will continue to support fishers to meet their obligations and to engage on general issues of concern. However, the MMO is not involved in or responsible for sourcing and/or arranging installation of equipment, nor rectifying individual faults and has no direct relationship with the suppliers of the devices. This is between fishers and their I-VMS device supplier.</p>

<p>If an I-VMS device develops a fault or needs to be replaced, fishers themselves will have to engage with the company that supplied their device to rectify the problem. The MMO is aware of fishers’ concerns about not being able to fish if their I-VMS stops working and has developed a process to enable them to go to sea for a limited period while the fault is put right.</p>

<p>Fishers need to check that their device is operational prior to leaving for fishing. All fishers will have the ability to check whether their device is functioning correctly through their chosen supplier. e.g., via an app or similar.</p>

<p>Where a fisher identifies their device is not operational and requires an engineer or supplier remedial work, they must first contact the supplier to log the issue and get an understanding of timescales for a fix. They then need to contact the MMO via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ivms@marinemanagement.org.uk">ivms@marinemanagement.org.uk</a> to request permission to fish via a defined ‘grace period’. The offering of these grace periods is at the discretion of the MMO, regularly reviewed and may be withdrawn at any time should MMO deem it appropriate to do so. At present this offering only applies when in English waters.</p>

<h2>Compliance</h2>

<p>I-VMS will become a legal requirement on all under-12m fishing vessels that operate in English waters. This is expected to come into force in late 2022. The MMO will adopt a proportionate approach in line with its Compliance and Enforcement strategy.</p>

<p>Please note. I-VMS devices must not be removed from a vessel unless it has a fault. In these instances, only a supplier approved engineer is permitted to remove the device to rectify the fault (costs may apply depending on what the support and service arrangements fishers have purchased through their supplier). The exception is where connectable power components are used to operate and power a device on the vessel. The fisher is permitted to detach these components when the vessel is no longer in use in order for them to be recharged away from the vessel, if needed, but must not remove the remainder of the device. This mirrors similar rules stipulated on the over 12metre VMS vessels.</p>

<h2>MMO support</h2>

<p>The MMO will support fishers in the under 12m fleet through the introduction of I-VMS and so will continue to provide information online and via email. Questions about approved devices and service and warranty offerings must be directed to the companies supplying them but the MMO and IFCA can assist fishers with information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Policy, including the rationale for introducing I-VMS</li>
  <li>The timetable for having a device installed</li>
  <li>Legal requirements and timescales</li>
  <li>Assurance and compliance</li>
  <li>Processes for reporting a faulty device and continuing to fish</li>
</ul>
