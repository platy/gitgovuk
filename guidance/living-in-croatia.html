<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Croatia before 1 January 2021, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement </a>.</p>

<p>You should check that you are correctly registered and should get a new residence document by 30 June 2021 to evidence your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you were living in Croatia before 1 January 2021 you need to get a new residence permit by 30 June 2021. If you donâ€™t you may have to pay a fine, though your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement will not be affected.</p>

<p>Read the Croatian governmentâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://mup.gov.hr/vijesti/information-concerning-the-future-relations-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union/283273">guidance on residence rights and how to apply</a>.</p>

<h3>Moving to Croatia</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/croatia/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Croatia</a> and read the <a href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/stay-of-foreigners/granting-stay-in-croatia-" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Croatian governmentâ€™s guidance on how to get a visa</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Croatia. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Croatia, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Croatia.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Croatia</a>.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before you book your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket, accommodation booking and that you have enough money for your stay.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit, as well as a temporary residence permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Driving in Croatia</h2>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia, you should exchange your UK licence for a Croatian one.</p>

<p>You should exchange your driving licence at the nearest police station. You can do this if you have either an approved <a rel="external" href="https://mup.gov.hr/vijesti/information-concerning-the-future-relations-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union/283273" class="govuk-link">temporary or permanent residence in Croatia</a>. To exchange your licence, you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your original UK driving licence and translation</li>
  <li>payment slip</li>
  <li>administrative fee</li>
  <li>a 35 x 45 mm photograph</li>
</ul>

<p>Other documentation may be required.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Croatia, you should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad" class="govuk-link">what you need to drive abroad</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>Driving in the UK with a Croatian licence</h3>

<p>You can use your Croatian licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test.</p>

<h3>Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Croatia</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the European Unionâ€™s guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/index_en.htm" rel="external">car registration and taxes</a> in Croatia. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-croatia/">healthcare in Croatia</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Croatia and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>are a frontier worker who lives in Croatia and commutes to work in the UK</li>
  <li>have been sent to Croatia temporarily by your UK employer</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-croatia#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Croatia</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC or GHIC for healthcare in Croatia, unless you are a student or a detached (posted) worker. Current EHICs will remain valid until the expiry date on the card.</p>

<p>If you are living in Croatia you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC or GHIC if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Croatia</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p>The card you receive will depend on when you moved to Croatia.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" rel="external">Apply now for a new UK EHIC or GHIC.</a></p>

<p>An EHIC or GHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Working in Croatia</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Croatia before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>If you are planning to come to Croatia to work, you may need a visa.</p>

<p>You may need to <a href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">apply for a UK police certificate</a> before you apply for a job.</p>

<p>Read the Department for International Tradeâ€™s guidance on:</p>

</ul>

<p>and sign up for their updates.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Croatia and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country, before January 2021, you may need a permit to prove that you are a frontier worker.</p>

<p>If you live in the UK or another EU or EFTA country and regularly commuted to work in Croatia before 1 January 2021, you need a frontier worker permit. Read the information on how to apply for the permit on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://mup.gov.hr/vijesti/information-concerning-the-future-relations-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union/283273">Ministry of Interiorâ€™s guidance for UK nationals</a>.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Croatia to make sure that you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Croatia have not changed following the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">telling HMRC if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice" class="govuk-link">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/croatia/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link">paying income tax in Croatia</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Ministry of Finance has information about custom services and declarations of goods in Croatia.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Croatia. You can find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/croatia-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">English-speaking lawyer in Croatia</a>.</p>

<h3>National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">pay National Insurance in the UK or social security contributions</a> in Croatia.</p>

<h3>Banking</h3>

<p>Whether UK banks can provide services to customers living in the EEA is a matter of local law and regulation.

<h2>Pets</h2>

<p>If you have a pet passport issued by Croatia or another EU member state, you can use it to travel with your pet to Great Britain and elsewhere in the EU.</p>

<p>A GB-issued EU pet passport is not valid for travel to the EU or Northern Ireland. You should speak to your vet before you travel to get the necessary pet travel documents and ensure youâ€™re compliant with the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/pet-movement_en" class="govuk-link">EU Pet Travel Regulations</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>Check the rules of the country youâ€™re travelling to for any additional restrictions or requirements before you travel.</p>
