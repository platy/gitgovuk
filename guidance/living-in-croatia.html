<h2>If you were living in Croatia before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Croatia since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Croatian Government and your local authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/croatia">Croatia travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Croatia, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/croatia/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check theâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/croatia/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Croatia</a>â€¯and read theâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://mvep.gov.hr/services-for-citizens/consular-information-22802/visas-22807/visa-requirements-overview-22879/22879?country=142" rel="external">Croatian governmentâ€™s guidance on how to get a visa</a></p>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia, you mustâ€¯carry and show both your valid passport (as a proof of identity) as well as your valid residence card at all times, in case asked for these by a police officer.â€¯</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Croatia before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you have lived in Croatia since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have rights under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should request a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mup.gov.hr/vijesti/information-concerning-the-future-relations-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union/283273" rel="external">new Withdrawal Agreement biometric residency card</a>â€¯â€˜Dozvola boravkaâ€™ from the Croatian police. This document shows that you have the rights defined in the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you request the new â€˜Dozvola boravkaâ€™. It also shows your right to enter Croatia and exempts you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<p>You may have to pay a fine (around 200 Croatian Kuna) if you did not apply before 30 June 2021, but your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement will not be affected.</p>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Croatia at any time in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>. They must travel to Croatia and then submit an application as your family member. Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Croatian authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<p>You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mup.gov.hr/vijesti/information-concerning-the-future-relations-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union/283273" rel="external">Croatian Ministry of Interiorâ€™s guidance for UK nationals on residency, driving and frontier workers</a>.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>

<p>If your application for the â€˜Dozvola boravkaâ€™ is refused, your local police station will send you a refusal notice. The notice will include information on how to appeal the decision via an administrative dispute procedure.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend you seek independent, specialised legal advice to support you if you appeal. The British Embassy cannot get involved in individual immigration applications. We cannot provide legal advice as we do not have the authority or expertise.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-croatia#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Croatia.</p>

<p>You canâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Croatia</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/croatia/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Croatia travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling to other EU/or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. If you have citizenship of an EU/or EFTA country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Croatia using your EU/or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>Croatia is not part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you stay in Croatia with a Croatian residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day in 180 days visit visa-free limit in Croatia or for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit countries in the Schengen area, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.â€¯</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™sâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice</a> pageâ€¯for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Croatia before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your Dozvola boravka or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of registration.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Croatia, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Croatia with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-croatia/">guidance on healthcare in Croatia</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>

<h2>Working in Croatia</h2>

<p>If you are planning to move to Croatia and work, you may need a visa.</p>

<p>To apply for a job you may need to provide a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" rel="external">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<h2>Professional qualifications</h2>

<p>The UK has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/croatia-tax-treaties">double taxation agreement with Croatia</a> so that you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>
