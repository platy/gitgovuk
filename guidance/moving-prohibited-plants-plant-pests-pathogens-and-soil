<p>This written agreement is valid for 12 months, provided the recipient’s licence isn’t amended or cancelled in this time.</p>

<p>If the recipient changes the terms of their licence you’ll have to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate">contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> for a new approval.</p>

<h3 id="receiving-material-from-other-sites">Receiving material from other sites</h3>

<p>You must have a licence to receive prohibited material from other people or organisations in England and Wales.</p>

<p>You must also make sure your supplier has a licence and a written agreement from the <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="receiving-material-from-outbreak-sites">Receiving material from outbreak sites</h3>

<p>You can only receive material from an outbreak site that’s under an <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> notice if the notice allows this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate">Contact the <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> if you’re unsure which are under notice.</p>

<p>You must have a licence to hold and work with any material you receive.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-material-in-from-other-countries">Bringing material in from other countries</h2>

<h3 id="letter-of-authority">Letter of authority</h3>

<p>If you get a licence to bring prohibited material in from overseas, it’ll have a ‘letter of authority’ attached - you must keep this letter</p>

<h3 id="from-countries-within-the-eu">From countries within the EU</h3>

<p>Follow these steps to bring material into England and Wales from other EU countries, including Scotland and Northern Ireland:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Send your supplier a copy of your letter of authority.</li>
  <li>Ask your supplier to get your letter of authority endorsed by the National Plant Protection Organisation (<abbr title="National Plant Protection Organisation">NPPO</abbr>) in their member state.</li>
  <li>Ask them to attach copies of the endorsed letter to the outside of the packages containing the licensed material and to include a copy inside each package.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="importing-from-non-eu-countries">Importing from non-EU countries</h3>

<p>Follow these steps to import prohibited material into England and Wales from non-EU countries under a licence:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Send a copy of your letter of authority to the supplier.</li>
  <li>Ask your supplier to attach the letter to the outside of the package and include a copy inside each package.</li>
</ol>

<p>For imports from outside the EU, you don’t need to have your letter of authority endorsed by the <abbr title="National Plant Protection Organisation">NPPO</abbr> in the supplier’s country.</p>

<p>If you’re importing material in luggage, you must present it at the red customs channel, along with the appropriate letter of authority, when you arrive in England or Wales.</p>

<h2 id="sending-material-to-other-countries">Sending material to other countries</h2>

<h3 id="to-eu-countries">To EU countries</h3>

  <li>Ask the recipient for a copy of their letter of authority.</li>
  <li>Send the copy of their letter of authority to the <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> to be endorsed.</li>
  <li>Attach the endorsed letter of authority to the outside of all packages before you send them. You should also include copies of the letter of authority inside the packaging.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the recipient tells you that you don’t need a letter of authority, ask them to show you official confirmation of this from their <abbr title="National Plant Protection Organisation">NPPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>You shouldn’t send your material until you’ve got this confirmation.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-to-non-eu-countries">Exporting to non-EU countries</h3>

<p>To export material to non-EU countries, you must comply with the import regulations in the destination country.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> may be able to give you advice about import regulations in the destination country.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-pack-materials">How to pack materials</h2>

<p>You must make sure any prohibited material you’re moving under a licence is stored in 3 layers of packaging.</p>

<p>At least 1 of the layers must be escape and shatter-proof.</p>

<h2 id="transport-handling-and-storage">Transport, handling and storage</h2>

<p>You must make sure you have licensed material transported to your authorised containment facility directly from the place of landing or the licensed establishment in England and Wales.</p>

<p>You must only open, handle and keep licensed material in the approved quarantine containment facility listed on your licence.</p>

<h2 id="inspections">Inspections</h2>

<p>You must make all licensed material available for inspection by your local <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> inspector.</p>

<p>You must allow the inspector to check how you’re keeping the material - they may take samples of material or any associated organisms, eg invertebrates.</p>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate">contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> on the first working day after the consignment arrives to inform them of any plants you’ve received under licence.</p>

<p>Keep the plants in isolation until the <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> has inspected them.</p>

<h3 id="inspection-fees">Inspection fees</h3>

<p>Your application fee covers the cost of your first inspection.</p>

<p>Some licences must then be inspected every year, especially new licences. In other cases inspectors will reinspect every 2 or 3 years.</p>

<p>The first inspector who visits your site will tell you how often you need to be reinspected.</p>

<p>If you fail an inspection you must pay for any further inspections, at a cost of £42.75 per hour or part of an hour.</p>

<h2 id="change-an-existing-licence">Change an existing licence</h2>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://edomero.defra.gov.uk/">apply to change your licence</a> using eDomero - eg to add new facilities or material.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> may re-inspect your facilities as part of this application process.</p>

<h3 id="licence-amendment-fees">Licence amendment fees</h3>

<p>Licence amendments that require a Defra scientific or technical assessment cost £265.21.</p>

<p>Amendments that don’t need an assessment cost £31.86.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will send you an invoice after you apply to change a licence through the eDomero system.</p>

<h2 id="destroying-plants-parts-of-plants-and-seeds">Destroying plants, parts of plants and seeds</h2>

<p>You must usually destroy plant material after you’ve completed the research your facility was licensed to do.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, you may be allowed to test the plant material and get it released from the terms of its licence.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate">Contact the <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> if you want to get plant material released from its licence instead of destroying it.</p>

<p>You’ll have to get the plant material tested and pay any costs associated with this.</p>
