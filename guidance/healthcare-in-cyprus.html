<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Cyprus.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-cyprus" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This information is about living in Cyprus. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re just visiting Cyprus</a>.</p>

<p>State healthcare in Cyprus is not free. Healthcare costs are covered by both the state and through patient contributions. These are known as co-payments.</p>

<p>Cyprus’s national health service is called the <a href="https://www.gesy.org.cy/sites/Sites?d=Desktop&amp;locale=en_US&amp;lookuphost=/en-us/&amp;lookuppage=home-en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">General Healthcare System (GHS)</a>.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access Cypriot healthcare in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a UK national working in Cyprus</li>
  <li>using a Cypriot permanent residents’ medical card</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with the GHS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Cyprus</h2>
<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-cyprus">register as a Cypriot resident</a> if you’re living or working in Cyprus for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>If you’re working in Cyprus, you must also register with the Cyprus Social Insurance Services and pay healthcare contributions.</p>

<p>Once you’re a resident, you can register with a Cypriot doctor through the General Healthcare System (GHS). You must be registered with both the GHS and a doctor to access state healthcare in Cyprus.</p>

<p>Once you’re registered with the GHS, you’ll be able to access state healthcare services.</p>

<p>You may need a referral from your doctor or a specialist for certain services.</p>

<p>If you’re on a low income, receive certain benefits or have an <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1</a>, you can <a rel="external" href="https://www.moh.gov.cy/moh/moh.nsf/All/9708963BBC895E4FC2257BAD0045791A?OpenDocument&amp;highlight=Medical%20Card" class="govuk-link">apply for a medical card</a>. A medical card means your co-payments will be lower or free when you access state healthcare services.</p>

<p>You cannot use your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> in Cyprus once you’re a resident.</p>

<p>If you’re registered for healthcare as a worker or a permanent resident, you may be entitled to a Cypriot <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>Create an account with the GHS. You can either <a rel="external" href="https://www.gesy.org.cy/sites/Sites?d=Desktop&amp;locale=en_US&amp;lookuphost=/en-us/&amp;lookuppage=home-en" class="govuk-link">register online through the GHS Beneficiary Portal</a>, or in person with your doctor.</p>

<p>Once you have a GHS account you must register with a GHS-listed doctor.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>State healthcare in Cyprus is not free. You may have to pay some of the cost of any treatment or service, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 euro for a prescribed medicine or medical product</li>
  <li>6 euros to see a specialist with a referral from your GP</li>
  <li>25 euros to see a specialist without a referral from your GP</li>
  <li>10 euros to go to A&amp;E</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your age, you’ll get a number of free visits with your registered GP each year. Your GP can tell you how many visits you’re entitled to.</p>

<p>Once you’ve used up your free GP visits, you’ll pay up to 15 euros per visit.</p>

<p>If you have a medical card, your co-payments are less.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Cyprus temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Cyprus using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you’ll need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Cyprus</h2>
<p>There’s different guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="#posted-worker">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-cyprus" class="govuk-link">Cypriot resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Cyprus before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it with the GHS.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Cyprus on the same basis as an insured Cypriot citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Cyprus than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Cyprus</h3>
<p>You must get an S1 form, then register with the GHS. You can either <a rel="external" href="https://www.gesy.org.cy/en-us/home-en" class="govuk-link">register online</a>, or through your local doctor.</p>

<p>Watch the video to find out <a href="https://www.gesy.org.cy/sites/Sites?d=Desktop&amp;locale=en_US&amp;lookuphost=/en-us/&amp;lookuppage=hiovideogalllery" rel="external" class="govuk-link">how to register for Cypriot healthcare as an S1 holder</a>.</p>

<p>Once registered, you will be issued with a Cypriot medical card. This will mean you’re entitled to reduced co-payments for state healthcare on the same basis as a Cypriot citizen.</p>

<p>Show your medical card when you visit a doctor.</p>

<h2>Studying in Cyprus</h2>
<p>You can use an <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
