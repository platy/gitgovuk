<p>The UK signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with Japan on 23 October 2020. This Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (<abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr>) maintains the benefits of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (<abbr title="Economic Partnership Agreement">EPA</abbr>) with enhancements in areas of mutual interest.</p>

<p>This guidance provides information on the key terms of trade for UK businesses trading under the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>For Japanese businesses trading with the UK, see <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.get-rules-tariffs-trade-with-uk.service.gov.uk/country/jp/information/">information on exporting to the UK from Japan</a>.</p>

<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-summary-of-chapters" class="govuk-link">which provisions each chapter of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> covers</a>.</p>

<p>For the full <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> text and other key documents, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-japan-comprehensive-economic-partnership-agreement">UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement collection page</a>.</p>

<h2>Tariff rates on goods</h2>

<p>Commitments on tariffs for the vast majority of products traded between the UK and Japan have been transitioned in <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> without changes.</p>

<p>In some cases, the tariff rates may be lower than the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan <abbr title="Economic Partnership Agreement">EPA</abbr>.  21 industrial goods have their duties eliminated in the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> tariff schedule. Tariffs on 2 tariff lines covering electrical control units often used in cars are also eliminated.</p>

<p>In Japan’s tariff schedule, 9 tariff lines covering certain leathers and hides will become duty free in 2026. One tariff line covering industrial ethanol has had duties eliminated.</p>

<h3>Online tools</h3>

<p>You can use online tools to check product-specific and country-specific information on tariffs and regulations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-rules-tariffs-trade-with-uk">look up tariffs, taxes and rules to trade with the UK</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-duties-customs-exporting">check duties and customs procedures for exporting goods</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These tools are regularly updated to reflect any changes.</p>

<h2>Tariff rate quotas</h2>

<p>Access to products covered by tariff rate quotas (<abbr title="tariff rate quotas">TRQs</abbr>) differ in the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> compared to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan <abbr title="Economic Partnership Agreement">EPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr>, the UK will continue to have access to the same preferential tariff rate as in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan <abbr title="Economic Partnership Agreement">EPA</abbr> for 10 <abbr title="tariff rate quotas">TRQs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 1: wheat products</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 2: mixes and doughs and cake mixes</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 3: food preparations made primarily of wheat</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 8: food preparations of barley</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 11: coffee, tea mixes, food preparations and doughs</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 12: food preparations</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 15: food preparations containing more than 50% of sucrose, and cocoa powder</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 19: food Preparations containing cocoa</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 20: food Preparations containing cocoa (for the preparation of chocolate)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> 25: cheeses</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-japan-cepa-agri-food-explainer">high level summary of agri-food market access</a>. This summary also covers arrangements for access to products covered by <abbr title="tariff rate quotas">TRQs</abbr> in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan <abbr title="Economic Partnership Agreement">EPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The quota available to Japanese importers for British products will be the entirety of any unutilised <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> quota in that year.</p>

<h3>Malt</h3>

<p>For malt, the UK will continue to have duty-free access to Japan’s market for malt via the existing Global <abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Before Permit (<abbr title="Before Permit">BP</abbr>) scheme</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> arrangement uses Japan’s <abbr title="Before Permit">BP</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>This scheme temporarily suspends the need to pay tariffs at the border. The importer must provide a guarantee to the customs authority. One way of doing this is via a Banker’s Guarantee. This means that at the point of import, Japanese importers only need to register the import under the <abbr title="Before Permit">BP</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>Japanese importers can register an import under the <abbr title="Before Permit">BP</abbr> scheme through Japan’s digitalised system for customs procedures. Find detailed information on <a href="https://gov.uk/government/publications/uk-japan-cepa-tariff-rate-quota-trq-scheme-technical-notice" class="govuk-link" rel="external">how the new <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> arrangement operates</a>.</p>

<p>The Japanese government provides <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.maff.go.jp/j/kokusai/boueki/triff4.html">information (in Japanese language only) on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan <abbr title="Economic Partnership Agreement">EPA</abbr> allocations</a> and returns of <abbr title="tariff rate quota">TRQ</abbr> quotas throughout the year. They will also publish information on the availability of quota for imports from the UK.</p>

<p>To find out more about the arrangements, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020" class="govuk-link">Annex 2-A of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Rules of origin</h2>

<h3>Finding the correct rule of origin for export</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of good you are seeking to export, in order to claim preferential treatment it will need to be either wholly obtained or sufficiently processed.</p>

<p>To be considered sufficiently processed your good will need to meet the relevant product specific rule (<abbr title="product specific rule">PSR</abbr>). The <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> for this agreement use the 2017 version of the Harmonised System (<abbr title="Harmonised System">HS</abbr>) nomenclature. You should apply the <abbr title="product specific rule">PSR</abbr> for your good using the code in which it was classified under this nomenclature.</p>

<p>In a limited number of cases the code for your good may have changed during <abbr title="Harmonised System">HS</abbr> revisions. We are currently updating our online services to reflect these changes. In the interim correlation tables tracing these changes have been made available by the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/instrument-and-tools/hs-nomenclature-2022-edition.aspx">World Customs Organisation</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/trade/classifications/correspondence-tables.asp" class="govuk-link">the United Nations</a></p>

<h3>Claiming preferential rates for your exports from the UK</h3>

<p>The requirements for claiming preference remain largely unchanged. A claim should be based on a statement of origin by the exporter that the product is originating, or the importer’s knowledge that the product is originating.</p>

<p>Further guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-japan-cepa-guidance-on-importers-knowledge">requirements for importer’s knowledge</a> is available.</p>

<h3>Small consignments and waivers</h3>

<p>Goods do not require a statement of origin if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>entering Japan from the UK and below 200,000 yen in value</li>
  <li>entering the UK from Japan and below £1,000 in value</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> materials and processing in your exports to Japan</h3>

<p>For exports of products that currently rely on <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> inputs to access preferential tariffs, you can continue to use <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> materials or processing in your exports to Japan. The working or processing you do in the UK must go beyond the minimal operations listed in the trade agreement. The other relevant conditions must also be fulfilled. A list of all goods covered by this arrangement can be found in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020" class="govuk-link">Annex 3-C of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Changes to product-specific rules for exports to Japan</h3>

<p>Find out about the changes to <a href="https://gov.uk/government/publications/uk-japan-cepa-changes-to-product-specific-rules-psrs" class="govuk-link" rel="external">product-specific rules</a>.</p>

<h3>Sending your goods to Japan through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and other countries</h3>

<p>Goods transited through third countries (including the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) still benefit from preferential treatment.</p>

<p>For example, you can split a consignment in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> when exporting goods to Japan. The goods comprising the consignment must not have cleared customs in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Transit through any other country is possible provided your goods remain under customs surveillance and do not undergo operations other than:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unloading</li>
  <li>reloading</li>
  <li>any operation designed to preserve them in good condition</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the provisions on rules of origin in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020" class="govuk-link">Chapter 3 and Annexes (3-A to 3-E) of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Customs procedures</h2>

<p>For information on Japan’s customs procedures, see the <a href="https://www.customs.go.jp/english/exp-imp/index.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">export/import guidance from the Japan Customs Agency</a> (website in English).</p>

<p>You can also read information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-declarations-for-goods-taken-out-of-the-eu" class="govuk-link">customs declarations for goods you send out of the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Product testing, standards and regulations</h2>

<p>Commitments related to standards, regulations and conformity assessment remain largely the same as under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan agreement.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> includes annexes covering a range of sectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>motor vehicles and parts in annex 2-C</li>
  <li>facilitation of shochu export in annex 2-D</li>
  <li>facilitation of wine export in annex 2-E</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mutual Recognition Protocol</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> replicates the effect of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan Mutual Recognition Agreement (<abbr title="mutual recognition agreement">MRA</abbr>) for Conformity Assessment, through a new Protocol on Mutual Recognition (<abbr title="mutual recognition agreement">MRA</abbr> Protocol).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="mutual recognition agreement">MRA</abbr> Protocol provides measures to simplify the process of demonstrating compliance with safety and other regulatory standards. For example, the <abbr title="mutual recognition agreement">MRA</abbr> Protocol’s good manufacturing practice for medicinal products annex requires the UK and Japan to recognise each other’s inspection and audit systems. It also requires the UK and Japan to waive batch testing of products on import into their territories.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="mutual recognition agreement">MRA</abbr> Protocol covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>electrical products</li>
  <li>good laboratory practice for chemicals</li>
  <li>good manufacturing practice for medicinal products (human) telecommunications and radio equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information related to standards, regulations and conformity assessment, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020" class="govuk-link">Chapter 7 and the <abbr title="mutual recognition agreement">MRA</abbr> Protocol of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Food safety and animal welfare</h3>

<p>Commitments related to sanitary and phytosanitary standards (<abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary standards">SPS</abbr>) and animal welfare remain largely the same as under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Japan Agreement.  Nothing in the UK-Japan <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> prevents the UK from continuing to uphold its high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards.</p>

<p>You can find the provisions on <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary standards">SPS</abbr> in Chapter 6 of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr>. For the provisions on animal welfare, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020" class="govuk-link">Chapter 18 Section B of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Trade in services</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> replicates commitments for preferential guaranteed market access and fair treatment for services suppliers and investors from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan <abbr title="Economic Partnership Agreement">EPA</abbr>. UK businesses should consult the relevant <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020">Annexes (8-B-I and 8-B-II)</a> for the level of guaranteed fair treatment and market access for their sector.</p>

<p>If you’re a UK business providing services in Japan, you’ll need to follow Japanese regulations, including on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>getting an authorisation or licence to provide a service</li>
  <li>complying with local business regulations</li>
  <li>Japanese nationality requirements which could prevent you from providing services in some sectors</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider appointing an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/japan-lawyers" class="govuk-link">English-speaking lawyer in Japan</a> to help you comply with specific regulations. You can also contact your local chamber of commerce for advice.</p>

<p>The Government of Japan provides advice on setting up a business and investing in Japan.</p>

<p>You can find the provisions on trade in services in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020" class="govuk-link">Chapter 8 and Annexes (8-B-I and 8-B-II) of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Business mobility</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> takes all the commitments on business mobility from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan <abbr title="Economic Partnership Agreement">EPA</abbr> and builds on them to provide additional opportunities for the UK and Japanese suppliers in the following areas.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> provides for the availability of visas for highly skilled professionals to work in Japan. An employee transferring from their UK HQ to the Tokyo office will be able to bring their spouse and dependents and stay for up to five years. The Government of Japan has information on <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">applying for Japanese visas</a>.</p>

<p>The UK definition of investor now focuses on investment in UK industry and jobs, rather than the amount of capital. Japan has expanded the scope of their intra-corporate transferee category.</p>

<p>The UK has also provided certainty that partners and dependent children of intra-corporate transferees can accompany them to the UK. Both the UK and Japan have committed to ensuring that the process for applying for visas will be clear, transparent, and with an aim that they be processed in 90 days.</p>

<p>You can find the provisions on business mobility in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020">Chapter 8 and Annexes (8-B-III, 8-B-IV and 8-C) of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Digital</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> contains measures aimed at supporting e-commerce between the UK and Japan.</p>

<p>The measures within this section are aimed at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prohibiting the application of customs duties to electronic transmissions and their contents</li>
  <li>preventing the forced transfer of source code as a condition of market access</li>
  <li>administering measures of general application affecting electronic commerce, such as the collection of information, in a reasonable, objective, and impartial manner</li>
  <li>making an effort to avoid requirements (for example: a permit, licence, or approval) that need to be obtained prior to an economic activity being allowed to start where such activity is done via electronic means</li>
  <li>protecting the legal effect, validity, and enforceability of an electronic contact</li>
  <li>protecting the legal effect or validity of an electronic signature (or the authenticating data resulting from electronic authentication) against discrimination resulting solely from its electronic form</li>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020" class="govuk-link">provisions on digital in section F of Chapter 8 of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Financial services</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> maintains the level of market access granted to financial services suppliers under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Japan <abbr title="Economic Partnership Agreement">EPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> also provides additional enhancements to strengthen commitments on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cross-border financial data flows to prohibit financial data localisation</li>
  <li>the ability to supply new financial services and on regulatory transparency for authorisation processes</li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to supply financial services in the Japanese market will continue to be governed by Japan’s financial regulatory authorities.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> also creates an annual dialogue between Her Majesty’s Treasury, UK financial regulators, and the Japanese FSA that will explore ways to further reduce regulatory friction.</p>

<p>You can find the provisions on financial services in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020">Chapter 8 and Annex 8-A of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Geographical indications</h2>

<p>Geographical indications (<abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr>) protect the geographical names of food, drink and agricultural products.</p>

<h3>UK <abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The following UK <abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr> include ‘cross-border <abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr>’ that relate to the territory of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p>These <abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr> are listed for protection in the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blue Stilton cheese</li>
  <li>White Stilton cheese</li>
  <li>West Country farmhouse Cheddar cheese</li>
  <li>Scottish farmed salmon</li>
  <li>Irish whisky/Irish whiskey/Uisce Beatha Eireannach</li>
  <li>Irish cream</li>
  <li>Scotch whisky</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the provisions on <abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr> in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020" class="govuk-link">Chapter 14 and Annexes (14-A and 14-B) of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Protection for additional <abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Protection in Japan for more UK <abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr> will be possible under the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr>. The UK and Japan have agreed that all eligible British products will be put through Japan’s <abbr title="geographical indication">GI</abbr> approval process automatically. This will allow additional UK products to be protected in Japan, subject to their domestic processes.</p>

<p>The UK government will put forward new <abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr> for protection in Japan on behalf of UK producers, saving time and money for UK businesses.</p>

<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) has contacted <abbr title="geographical indication">GI</abbr> producers to confirm whether they would like their <abbr title="geographical indication">GI</abbr> included in the agreement. Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-japan-cepa-geographical-indications-explainer" class="govuk-link">how additional <abbr title="geographical indications">GIs</abbr> will be protected</a> under the agreement.</p>

<h2>Government procurement</h2>

<p>Commitments made on government procurement between the UK and Japan have been transitioned in the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> without changes.</p>

<p>This means that the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr> retains guarantees on non-discriminatory access to the Japanese government procurement market. This includes additional market access beyond Japan’s offer under the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gp_gpa_e.htm"><abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr> Agreement on Government Procurement</a> (<abbr title="Agreement on Government Procurement">GPA</abbr>).</p>

<p>In the Japanese market, UK businesses now benefit from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>access to regional level procurement opportunities, including procurement by Core Cities</li>
  <li>access to contracts across a wide range of services including business services, insurance, telecoms, translation, photography, specialist design, food and beverage serving services</li>
  <li>improved standards for the publication of procurement opportunities across all levels of government</li>
  <li>a commitment to publish procurement notices for Japanese procurement covered by this agreement on the <a href="https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/database/procurement/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Japanese Government Procurement e-portal</a>
</li>
  <li>a commitment that the ‘Keishin’ business evaluation procedure will not be used in a manner that discriminates against UK businesses</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find all additional procurement coverage that goes further than the <abbr title="Agreement on Government Procurement">GPA</abbr> schedules in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukjapan-agreement-for-a-comprehensive-economic-partnership-cs-japan-no12020">Annex 10 of the <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement">CEPA</abbr></a>.</p>
