<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Latvia to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Latvia) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>Latvia’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/entry-latvia" rel="external">Latvia’s government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Latvia. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en" rel="external">Latvia’s immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Latvia, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Latvia’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>
<p>You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Latvia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>going to court as a witness</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs</li>
  <li>attending board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>fact-finding visits</li>
  <li>negotiating, signing and executing deals or contracts</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference as long as you’re not being paid</li>
  <li>studying</li>
  <li>team-building activities</li>
  <li>visiting business partners</li>
  <li>conducting research or developing professional contacts</li>
</ul>

<p>Or for the following types of training as long as it’s for the same company or group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving classroom-based training</li>
  <li>receiving on-the-job training</li>
  <li>shadowing someone’s job</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Latvia’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities in Europe do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>The following may not require a visa or permit in Latvia:</p>

<ul>
  <li>artists and admin staff involved in a touring performance or concert for up to 14 days</li>
  <li>freight and passenger carrier workers, including seafarers</li>
  <li>those invited by an educational or scientific institution to conduct scientific research work, or implement educational programmes, for up to 14 days</li>
  <li>those registered in the Latvian commercial register, a member of a board or council, a proctor such as an agent or attorney, an administrator, a liquidator or member of a company partnership who has the right to represent the partnership, for up to 90 days in a 6-month period</li>
  <li>those authorised to represent a non-Latvian company in activities related to its branch in Latvia, for up to 90 days in a 6-month period</li>
  <li>self-employed work, for up to 90 days in a 6-month period</li>
  <li>temporary work assignments for a UK employer, for up to 14 days in a 180-day period</li>
  <li>trainee internships up to 2 years after completing higher education studies</li>
  <li>traineeship as part of a study programme</li>
</ul>

<h3>EU intra-company transfer permits from other countries</h3>
<p>If you have an intra company transfer permit (EU ICT) from another country you can use this to work in Latvia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.</p>

<p>Your employer has to notify the State Labour Inspectorate and wait for a response before you can start work.</p>

<p>Exemptions are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>employment confirmation</li>
  <li>a contract or after-sales agreement</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as degree and professional certificates</li>
  <li>CV</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>
<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Latvia’s embassy</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en" rel="external">immigration authorities</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>
<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Latvia’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en" rel="external">immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>
<p>You won’t be able to get dependant visas for any family members if you’re working on a Schengen C or national D visa. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver rules</a>.</p>

<p>There may be different rules for taking families if you have a temporary residence permit.</p>

<h3>Visas and residence permits</h3>

<p>You need one of the following visas depending on how long you’re working in Latvia:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#visa">Schengen C visa for up to 90 days in a 180-day period</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#visa">national D visa for up to 1 year</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You need a temporary residence permit if you’re in Latvia for more than 1 year because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring long-term from a UK-based company to a Latvian branch</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a company in Latvia on a long-term Latvian contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing long-term services to a client in Latvia</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#investor">working in Latvia as an investor</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#startup">establishing a start-up in Latvia</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research work</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Temporary residence permits are valid for up to 5 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<h2>Schengen C and national D visas for short-term work</h2>

<p>To qualify for a Schengen C or national D visa you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an employment contract with either a company in the UK or Latvia</li>
  <li>stay on UK payroll if employed by a UK company, or on Latvian payroll if employed by a Latvian company</li>
  <li>meet minimum monthly income requirements – check with the authorities as this amount may change over time</li>
  <li>have an education and, or professional experience relevant to the job</li>
</ul>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>You submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://epak.pmlp.gov.lv/NVIS.EService001.WebSite/ApplicationMain.aspx?" rel="external">visa application</a> to the Latvian consulate or embassy.</p>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>Latvia’s authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed visa application form</li>
  <li>UK passport for you and any dependants, valid for 3 months beyond the expected expiry date of the visa</li>
  <li>employment contract or service agreement</li>
  <li>proof of financial stability, such as bank statements or payslips</li>
  <li>proof of travel and medical insurance cover for the duration of your permit</li>
  <li>proof of your accommodation in Latvia</li>
  <li>confirmation from your UK employer that you’ve been employed by them for at least 6 months, if working on a temporary assignment</li>
  <li>proof you’ve paid the government application fees (state duty payment)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Schengen C and national D visas can take between 4 to 8 weeks to get. The Schengen C visa is valid for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. The national D visa for up to 1 year.</p>

<h2>Transferring long term to a Latvian branch of a UK-based company</h2>
<p>You need an EU ICT permit if your UK-based company moves you to a branch in Latvia to work for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 3 years</li>
  <li>1 year if you’re a trainee</li>
</ul>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a manager, specialist or trainee</li>
  <li>have at least 3 years’ relevant education or professional experience</li>
  <li>have worked for the UK company for at least 6 months before the transfer</li>
  <li>meet minimum salary requirements – check the amount with the authorities as this may change over time</li>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract</li>
  <li>stay on UK payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a spouse or children under 18 they can join you by applying for dependant permits.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You need to check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Latvia’s embassy or consulate</a> on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The branch in Latvia requests permission from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en" rel="external">Latvian Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs</a> to employ you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/applications" rel="external">residence permit application</a> to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en" rel="external">Latvian Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs</a> or to the Latvian consulate or embassy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/lv/filiales" rel="external">make an appointment</a> with the Latvian Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs and submit biometrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re tested for tuberculosis (TB) in Latvia.</p>
