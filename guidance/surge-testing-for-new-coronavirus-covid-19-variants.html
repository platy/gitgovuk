<h2>What surge testing is</h2>

<p>Surge testing is increased testing (including door-to-door testing in some areas) and enhanced contact tracing in specific locations in England.</p>

<p>It involves testing of people who do not have any symptoms of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Surge testing started on Monday 1 February.</p>

<p>Genomic sequencing means analysing the virus sample to understand how it compares with other cases.</p>

<h2>Why the government is using surge testing</h2>

<p>Extensive surveillance of coronavirus has identified a small number of cases of COVID-19 variants and mutations which cannot be traced back to international travel.</p>

<p>The government is using surge testing and genomic sequencing to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>monitor and suppress the spread of coronavirus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>better understand new variants</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Further data on surge testing will be provided in due course.</p>

<h2>Who should get a test</h2>

<p>You should get a test for coronavirus if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>live in targeted locations within one of the postcode areas listed on this page</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are aged 16 years or over</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should get a test even if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you have no symptoms of coronavirus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you’ve had a vaccination for coronavirus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you’ve tested positive for coronavirus previously (but not within the last 90 days)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you’ve recently spent time within one of the areas targeted for surge testing but do not live there, you should continue to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home">national restrictions</a> and check with your local authority whether you should get a test.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who should not get a test</h2>

<p>If you have tested positive within the last 90 days, you do not need to be tested.</p>

<h2>How to get a test</h2>

<p>Local authorities in the postcode areas on this page are providing PCR testing to people without symptoms through extra:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>home testing kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mobile testing sites</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">Visit your local authority website</a> to find out more.</p>

<h2>What happens after your test</h2>

<p>If you test positive with a PCR test, your test will be sent to a laboratory for genomic sequencing.</p>

<p>You must isolate with your household and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">follow the guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus infections</a>. Public Health England will carry out enhanced tracing of close contacts of confirmed cases of the variant.</p>

<p>There is currently no evidence that variants cause more severe illness.</p>

<p>Positive PCR tests from institutions within these specific locations, such as care homes, will also be sent for genomic sequencing.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If you test negative you should continue to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national lockdown rules</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you have coronavirus symptoms</h2>

<p>If you have coronavirus symptoms, it is important that you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a test for people with symptoms</a> online, via the NHS COVID-19 app or by calling 119.</p>

<p>You must isolate with your household and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">follow the guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus infections</a> until you get your result.</p>

<h2>Continue to follow national lockdown rules</h2>

<p>If you live within one of the postcode areas on this page, the same <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home">national restrictions</a> still apply.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>stay at home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only leave home where it is absolutely essential</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should also practise <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#hands-face-space" class="govuk-link">Hands. Face. Space</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in an area deploying surge testing and need to leave your home because you cannot work from home, or for other essential reasons, you should get tested.</p>
