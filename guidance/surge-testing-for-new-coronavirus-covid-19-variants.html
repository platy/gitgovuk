<h2>What surge testing is</h2>

<p>Surge testing is increased testing (including door-to-door testing in some areas) and enhanced contact tracing in specific locations in England and can look different depending on assessment of local requirements.</p>

<p>It involves testing of people who do not have any symptoms of COVID-19.</p>

<p>In areas where the new Delta variant, B1.617.2 is spreading fastest, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#if-youre-in-an-area-where-the-new-covid-19-variant-is-spreading" class="govuk-link">there is additional guidance available to help stop the spread</a> and there may also be targeted activity to drive vaccine uptake amongst eligible cohorts.</p>

<p>Tests from all of these areas are sent for genomic sequencing. Genomic sequencing is the process of testing a sample of the virus to map its genetic sequence and is used to identify variants.</p>

<p>If you need to take part in surge testing you will be informed by your local council.</p>

<h2>Why the government is using surge testing</h2>

<p>Extensive surveillance of COVID-19 has identified a number of cases of COVID-19 variants and mutations of concern in England.</p>

<p>The government is using surge testing and genomic sequencing to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>monitor and suppress the spread of COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>better understand new variants</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your local authority is carrying out surge testing, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">visit your local authority website</a> to find out exactly where testing is being targeted.</p>

<p>Enhanced testing for variants may be happening on a more targeted basis or within specific settings in other areas. If you need to partake you will be informed by your local council.</p>

<h2>Who should get a test</h2>

<p>You should get a test for COVID-19 if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>live in targeted locations within one of the areas listed on this page or are contacted by your local council</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are in the targeted age group</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should get a test even if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you have no symptoms of COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you’ve had a vaccination for COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you’ve tested positive for COVID-19 previously (but not within the last 90 days by a PCR test)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you’ve recently spent time within one of the areas targeted for surge testing but do not live there, you should continue to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national restrictions</a> and check with your local authority whether you should get a test. Please note there may be additional advice for your area due to the variant.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who should not get a test</h2>

<p>If you have tested positive with a PCR test within the last 90 days, you do not need to be tested.</p>

<h2>How to get a test</h2>

<p>Local authorities in the postcode areas on this page are providing PCR testing to people without symptoms through extra:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>home testing kits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mobile testing sites</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">Visit your local authority website</a> to find out more.</p>

<h2>What happens after your test</h2>

<p>If you test positive with a PCR test, your test will be sent to a laboratory for genomic sequencing.</p>

<p>You must isolate with your household and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">follow the guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infections</a>. Public Health England will carry out enhanced tracing of close contacts of confirmed cases of the variant.</p>

<p>There is currently no evidence that variants cause more severe illness.</p>

<p>Positive PCR tests from institutions within these specific locations, such as care homes, will also be sent for genomic sequencing.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you test negative you should continue to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home">national restrictions</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you have COVID-19 symptoms</h2>

<p>If you have COVID-19 symptoms, it is important that you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a test for people with symptoms</a> online, via the NHS COVID-19 app or by calling 119.</p>
