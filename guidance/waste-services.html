<h2>Our Role</h2>

<p>As part of its role as the NDA’s Low Level Waste (LLW) management contractor, Nuclear Waste Services is leading the implementation of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/497114/NI_LLW_Strategy_Final.pdf" rel="external">UK Strategy for the Management of Solid Low Level Radioactive Waste from the Nuclear Industry</a>, as approved by Government in February 2016, in addition to the 2019 UK Integrated Waste Management Radioactive Waste Strategy, through the LLW <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-waste-programme/national-waste-programme">National Waste Programme</a>.</p>

<p>The core objectives of the programme are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implement the Waste Management Hierarchy</li>
  <li>Enable best use of existing assets</li>
  <li>Enable use of flexible fit-for-purpose solutions to make best use of the Low Level Waste Repository site</li>
  <li>Deliver value-for-money</li>
</ul>

<p>To deliver this, we have developed a number of radioactive waste management services which are available to the nuclear industry and other producers of radioactive waste. These services provide access to a broad range of supply chain waste management expertise and facilities for treatment and disposal of radioactive waste.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Our vision</h3>
<p>To be our customer’s first choice for waste solutions.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Our mission</h3>
<p>Implementing the NDA’s strategy through the provision of integrated radioactive waste treatment, logistics and disposal solutions; and support the UK’s radioactive waste programmes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<p>We are specialists in the treatment and disposal of nuclear waste. Our goal is to ensure that waste is managed in a way that protects people and the environment, now and in the future. We work with customers to provide waste management services and solutions to address their challenges. As well as providing advice and expertise, we manage contracts and relationships across the waste cycle.</p>

<p>We are also responsible for delivering the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-waste-programme/national-waste-programme">National Waste Programme</a> on behalf of the NDA and providing a range of waste management services to help waste producers follow the waste management hierarchy – diverting waste from disposal at the Low Level Waste Repository site, near Drigg in Cumbria, to alternative reuse, recycling, treatment and disposal routes.</p>

<p>Our site and our business are essential to the successful delivery of the NDA’s mission; to clean up the UK’s nuclear legacy. However, we are also vital to non-NDA organisations in the nuclear energy, defence, industrial, medical and research sectors. These organisations need us now and in the future.</p>

<p><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1077794/LLW13870_Logistic_Services_ACC.pdf">Logistics Services brochure</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">5.65 MB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">24 pages</span>)</span></p>

<h2>Disposal Solutions</h2>

<h3>Very Low Level Waste</h3>

<p>Waste with low activity levels that fall within the categories of High Volume Very Low Level Waste (HV-VLLW) or Low Active Low Level Waste (LALLW) can be disposed to permitted landfill sites.</p>

<p>We have several landfill sites available through our supply chain which are able to accept a wide range of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. This includes wastes with various activity levels from 4Bq/g up to several hundred Bq/g.</p>

<p>Typical packages used for disposal can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Soft Sided Packages</li>
  <li>Drums or ISO containers</li>
  <li>Wrapped and un-wrapped single items</li>
</ul>

<h3>Low Level Waste</h3>

<p>We operate the UK’s National Low Level Waste disposal facility situated near the village of Drigg in West Cumbria.</p>

<p>Waste is typically disposed of in Half-Height or Third-Height ISO containers that are delivered by rail or road. All waste is required to meet the Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) or an approved variation. For further information on WAC please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">Customer Team.</a></p>

<p>Once the waste has been accepted for disposal, the container is grouted prior to disposal in an engineered concrete vault at the Repository site. Once the vault reaches capacity a final engineered cap will be constructed over the vault, providing long-term protection to the wastes and the environment.</p>

<h2>Information for new customers</h2>

<p>For advice on any of our services or for details of how to become a customer, please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">Customer Team.</a></p>

<h4>1. Early Engagement</h4>

<p>We would advise all new customers to discuss their waste management needs with our Waste Services team as soon as they are aware they require our treatment or disposal services. Early engagement allows any issues to be identified and resolved. We offer Waste Characterisation, Packaging and Transport services to enable Customers to manage their waste in line with the Waste Hierarchy and deliver “a right first time solution”.</p>

<h4>2.  Agreement in Principle</h4>

<p>An Agreement in Principle is used when waste will not be generated for some time and a customer requires some confidence that the waste is suitable for consignment to the Repository site. This allows you to continue with operations in the knowledge that a Waste Services Contract will be entered into at a later date. To initiate this process, please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">Customer Team.</a></p>

<h4>3. Disposal Authorisation</h4>

<p>To allow the treatment or disposal of LLW, the customer must hold a valid disposal authorisation obtained from the relevant environmental agency (Environment Agency for England and Wales or Scottish Environmental Protection Agency for Scotland) and issued under the relevant legislation.</p>

<p>The authorisation will state the requirements the customer must fulfil in order to transfer waste to Nuclear Waste Services for treatment and/or disposal. This is likely to specify limits on both the radioactivity concentration of the waste and the total radioactivity that can be transferred to us.</p>

<h4>4. Waste Services Contract</h4>

<p>New customers must enter into a Waste Services Contract in order to access the services we offer. The contract incorporates four key elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Terms and Conditions</li>
  <li>Waste Acceptance Criteria</li>
  <li>Waste Acceptance Procedure</li>
  <li>Service Pricing Mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a standard Waste Services Contract which commenced on 1 April 2020 and will expire on 31 March 2025. This ensures that all customers are treated equitably.</p>
