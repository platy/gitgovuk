<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The objective of <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> is that women have access to improved economic opportunities through business interventions in supply chains and economic development programmes.</p>

<p>The 5 year programme aims to enhance the economic empowerment of 300,000 women working in global value chains and work with 35 economic development programmes to increase the numbers of women beneficiaries by September 2022.</p>

<p>It will achieve this goal by supporting businesses, organisations and programmes that are ready and willing to act on women’s economic empowerment (<abbr title="Women’s Economic Empowerment">WEE</abbr>); enabling players across the supply chain ecosystem to drive change; and influencing the UK and global agenda on women’s economic empowerment.</p>

<p>It is being delivered by an alliance of global experts at the cutting edge of women’s economic empowerment research, program design, and delivery. PwC leads this alliance that includes BSR, CARE International, the University of Manchester, and Social Development Direct.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Four areas of activity</h2>

<h3>1. Partnerships with business to improve women’s participation in supply chains: businesses improve women’s access to higher-return and higher-productivity jobs and roles in supply chains, with improving working conditions</h3>

<p><abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr>’s unique approach, the first of its kind for FCDO, will accelerate business action through access to experts rather than by providing traditional funding. It will focus on the most entrenched barriers to progress and go beyond simply encouraging women’s participation in global value chains, to enabling dignified, equal, and economically empowering work for women.</p>

<p>It will do this in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>scale: existing programmes which have demonstrated proven or promising results can be scaled up such that they reach more women</li>
  <li>replication: initiatives which are proven to be successful can be replicated elsewhere to maximise their impact</li>
  <li>innovation: new interventions can be piloted in a small number of cases</li>
  <li>sustainability: interventions that create lasting, systemic change by supporting existing interventions to transform social norms on gender, promote the adoption of new public policies and adapt existing legislation, promote changes in business practice in supply chains</li>
  <li>depth: existing programmes can have their scope increased or improved such that they empower women within their supply chains more successfully or in a more sophisticated way</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Partnerships with business to improve data and transparency on women’s work in supply chains: women’s work in supply chains is made more visible, to improve global knowledge on women’s economic contribution</h3>

<p>The programme will partner with a number of companies in priority sectors to gain a deeper understanding of the risks and opportunities for women, particularly deeper in the supply chain where women may be less visible, and/or their greatest challenges are unknown. The research will also help us identify other opportunities for partnership that meet <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr>’s criteria for further intervention.</p>

<p>Research will be undertaken at 3 levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>macro-level (global supply chains)</li>
  <li>meso-level (company supply chains)</li>
  <li>micro-level (deep dive country supply chains)</li>
</ul>

<p>In <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/903073/The-Double-Day-WOW-Primark-Unpaid-Work-Care-Report-July2020a.pdf">The Double Day</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">1.22 MB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">21 pages</span>)</span>, the <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> programme explores the issue of unequal and unpaid work and care among garment workers in Bangladesh. The briefing paper presents an overview of current knowledge about unpaid care in the sector, and shares findings from primary research conducted with garment workers in 2019.</p>

<h3>3. Increased knowledge and support for delivering women’s economic empowerment through economic development programmes</h3>

<p>HMG economic development programmes reach larger numbers of women and improve global knowledge on how to deliver results for women and girls through economic development interventions.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> Helpdesk will provide FCDO and other government departments with access to rapid technical assistance and expert analysis for guidance, and know-how to address <abbr title="Women’s Economic Empowerment">WEE</abbr> at different stages of programming through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a responsive query and programme support service, drawing on a wider expert pool to respond to queries from FCDO advisers across central and country programmes</li>
  <li>proactive guidance and support on priority themes for <abbr title="Women’s Economic Empowerment">WEE</abbr> across Economic Development portfolio</li>
  <li>regular communications updates drawing together learning from <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> and wider research and evidence on <abbr title="Women’s Economic Empowerment">WEE</abbr>, in the form of evidence digests</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. The Work and Opportunities for Women (<abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr>) Fund</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> Fund supports initiatives that drive forward the Action Agenda of UN High Level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment (<abbr title="UN High Level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment">UNHLP</abbr>). The £1.8 million Fund supports select, strategic initiatives which promote long-term change in women’s economic empowerment.</p>

<p>The Fund complements the wider activities of the <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> programme, which works directly with global supply chains and with HMG programmes to support improved women’s economic empowerment (<abbr title="Women’s Economic Empowerment">WEE</abbr>) outcomes.</p>

<p>Initiatives supported by the Fund will deliver and demonstrate catalytic impact and contribute to global knowledge on how to economically empower women in 3 key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enhancing land tenure security</li>
  <li>recognising, reducing and redistributing unpaid care and work</li>
  <li>improving outcomes for women in informal work</li>
</ul>

<p>Following a selection process in 2018, the <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> Fund is pleased to announce that grants have been awarded to support the following projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>innovations in informal land tenure awareness, rights and security for the economic empowerment of informal women workers in Delhi and Patna. Lead implementer: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://sewabharat.org/" rel="external">SEWA Bharat</a> with implementing partners SEWA Delhi, SEWA Bihar, SEWA Grih Rin and the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://iihs.co.in/" rel="external">Indian Institute of Human Settlements</a> (IIHS). This project aligns with the <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> Fund priority area of enhancing women’s land tenure security. It will work with women home based and domestic workers living in informal settlements to increase their land tenure awareness and security, as well as access to infrastructure services and housing finance. This in turn will lead to increased economic opportunities for women and strengthened individual and collective agency of women to advocate for change with local and municipal authorities. Learning generated can inform wider advocacy efforts to promote security of tenure for women in informal settlements and the development of innovative finance products and services targeting women informal workers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accelerating national progress toward achieving equality in unpaid care and domestic work and promoting women’s economic empowerment. Lead implementer: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://promundoglobal.org/" rel="external">Promundo-US</a> with implementing partners <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rwamrec.org/" rel="external">Rwanda Men’s Resource Center</a> (RWAMREC) and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://genderjustice.org.za/" rel="external">Sonke Gender Justice</a>. This project aligns with the <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> Fund priority area of recognising, reducing, and redistributing unpaid care and domestic work. Its overall aim is to support and facilitate the redistribution of unpaid care work responsibilities between women and men and to increase women’s decision-making power within the relationship, in part, to support women’s economic agency and advancement more broadly. This approach involves thoughtful and consistent dialogue with individuals and institutions with the intention of questioning, challenging, and changing harmful and restrictive gender stereotypes that perpetuate social and economic inequality. In Rwanda and South Africa, Promundo and partners will adapt Program P, a curriculum aimed at engaging men in active fatherhood from their partners’ pregnancies through their children’s early years, to increase its focus on issues specific to <abbr title="Women’s Economic Empowerment">WEE</abbr>. The initiative will also support selected government ministries and civil society actors in both countries to incorporate this approach into existing systems and institutions, including by offering trainings and ongoing support to community health workers and social work personnel. The initiative will produce evidence and learning on how to ‘scale up’ approaches aiming to redistribute unpaid care work at the household level, as well as on the links of this programming to wider <abbr title="Women’s Economic Empowerment">WEE</abbr> outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>home-based Workers Organizing for Economic Empowerment.  Lead implementer: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.wiego.org/" rel="external">Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing</a> (WIEGO) with implementing partner <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hnsa.org.in/" rel="external">HomeNet South Asia (HNSA)</a>. This project aligns with the <abbr title="Work and Opportunities for Women">WOW</abbr> Fund priority area of improving outcomes for women in informal work. The WIEGO/HNSA initiative will empower home-based worker (HBW) leaders to negotiate better outcomes for their members working in precarious conditions in the garments sector. The initiative will also support the building of alliances between HBW organisations and wider civil society groups working for change in women’s working conditions in the garments industry; support exchanges between HBW leaders in South Asia and East Africa, and contribute to the emergence of a global HBW Network. The learning generated will build understanding of how to build effective negotiating strategies that improve the situation of women home-based workers and on the role of national and global organising in enabling positive change for these women</p>
