<h2>If you were living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you were living in the Netherlands since before 1 January 2021. These are indicated with sub-headings.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>You should follow the advice of the Dutch government and your local authority. You can also read FCDO <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/travel-advice-help-and-support">Netherlands travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in the Netherlands, see our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirement for the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Living-in-the-Netherlands-after-Brexit.aspx#2" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Immigration and Naturalisation Service (<abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>) guidance on moving to the Netherlands</a></p>

<p>If you moved to the Netherlands after 1 January 2021, you are treated as a â€˜third country nationalâ€™. A third country national is someone who does not have EU, EEA or Swiss nationality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To move to the Netherlands you need a residence permit for a specific  purpose. Common residence purposes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/family/residence-permit-for-your-partner/Pages/partner.aspx">residence with your partner</a>: you would like to live with your partner as a family</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/study/Pages/default.aspx">study</a>: you would like to study (university, secondary or vocational education)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://ind.nl/en/work/Pages/default.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">work</a>: you would like to work there as an employee, or by setting up your own business as a&nbsp;self-employed person&nbsp;or&nbsp;start-up company</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By law, you must always carry photo ID, for example your passport or residence permit.</p>

<h3>Citizen service number (BSN)</h3>

<p>Everyone living in the Netherlands must have a citizen service number, often referred to as a BSN (burgerservicenummer). You must register with your local municipality (gemeente) to obtain a citizen service number (BSN).</p>

<p>You must apply for a BSN within 5 days of arriving in the Netherlands. You will need to make an appointment with the local municipality (gemeente) where you live. Your local municipalityâ€™s website provides information on how to book an appointment and what documentation you will need.</p>

<p>You need a BSN for many administrative procedures in the Netherlands, including working, opening a bank account, arranging health insurance, visiting a doctor or hospital, or applying for benefits.</p>

<p>Read the Dutch governmentâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/citizen-service-number-bsn" rel="external">guidance about BSN numbers</a>.</p>

<h3>Registering in the Personal Records Database</h3>

<p>Every resident of the Netherlands must be registered in the Personal Records Database, referred to as the BRP (Basisregistratie Personen) which is held by the local municipality. You may request this at the same time you apply for your BSN.</p>

<p>If you move house, you should make sure you re-register again at your new address. The <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> and other government bodies will use the BRP to contact you.</p>

<p>If you leave the Netherlands to become resident elsewhere, you must deregister from the BRP before you leave the Netherlands. If you move back to the Netherlands, you will need to register at your local municipality and you will be assigned the same BSN as you had before.</p>

<h3>Working for an international organisation</h3>

<p>If you are working for an international organisation, you do not need to apply for a permanent residence document, providing you remain employed by that organisation.</p>

<p>If you previously worked for an international organisation and you wish to continue living in the Netherlands, read the Dutch government guidance on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/permanent-residence/Pages/formerly-privileged-and-their-family-members.aspx">how to apply for a permanent residence permit as an â€˜ex-privilegedâ€™ person</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you applied for your new residence document (â€˜Article 50 TEU (Treaty on European Union) residence documentâ€™) by 30 September 2021, your rights are protected by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a> pending a decision on your application. You should continue the process to get your Article 50 TEU residence document if you do not have it yet.</p>

<p>If you have a temporary Article 50 TEU residence document, you can apply for a permanent residence document after living lawfully for 5 consecutive years in the Netherlands. You do not need to wait for the expiry of your temporary permit first.</p>

<p>If you have Dutch citizenship or EU citizenship with a valid Dutch national residence document, you do not need an Article 50 TEU residence document.</p>

<p>If you work for an international organisation, you do not need an Article 50 TEU residence document if you remain employed by that organisation.  Your residence rights, and your privileges and immunities under the relevant host agreement do not change. If you wish to apply for an Article 50 TEU residence permit, consult your legal and HR departments, as this may affect your privileges and immunities.</p>

<p>Your former EU residence document (duurzaam verblijf) is no longer valid.  If you had one, you should have <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Living-in-the-Netherlands-after-Brexit.aspx#EU_duurzaam">exchanged it for an Article 50 TEU residence document</a>. If you are currently away from the Netherlands, and you have not provided your current address, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>&nbsp;cannot contact you to arrange the exchange.</p>

<p>To discuss your circumstances and what you need to do, call the&nbsp;general <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> helpline on: +31 (0)88 04 30410 (Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm).</p>

<p>If you have a Type II residency document issued under the Aliens Act, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>&nbsp;has granted you an additional residency status under the Withdrawal Agreement. More information on this will be provided in <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/Paginas/Mijn-IND.aspx">mijnind.nl</a>. Whilst you can have 2 statuses, you can only have 1 residence document. You can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>keep your Type II permanent residence document if it has not expired, or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>exchange it for an Article 50 TEU residence document, provided it has not been withdrawn. You will need to pay a fee to exchange it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Decision on your application and biometrics</h3>

<p>When you apply for an Article 50 TEU residence document, you will receive a letter from the&nbsp;<abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>. This letter is your â€˜certificate of applicationâ€™.</p>

<p>After you have applied, you need to make an appointment to have your biometrics taken. You do not have to wait for a decision on your application before you do this. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>&nbsp;will take your fingerprints, a photo of you and your signature. You can book your appointment at an&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Biometrics-appointment-after-Brexit.aspx"><abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>&nbsp;desk or at an expat centre</a>. The appointment can be booked online, but you must attend in person.</p>

<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Biometrics-appointment-after-Brexit.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>&nbsp;guidance on biometric appointments and how to book one</a>.</p>

<p>You will receive a decision on your application through your&nbsp;DigiD message box&nbsp;(Berichtenbox). The decision will be written in Dutch.</p>

<p>If your application is approved, read the Dutch government&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" class="govuk-link">guidance on how you will receive your residence document card</a> (open the Brexit section under â€˜Frequently asked questions about the effects of the coronavirusâ€™).</p>

<p>If you have not had a response to your Article 50 TEU residence document application, <a href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/default.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">contact the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr></a> or call the&nbsp;general <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> helpline on +31 (0)88 04 30410 (Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm).</p>

<h3>Appeals process</h3>

<p>If your application for a new residence document is refused, you will be notified about the appeal process. Read the Dutch governmentâ€™s advice on&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/objection-and-appeal.aspx" class="govuk-link">how to appeal a residency decision</a>. This includes information about time limits for submitting an appeal and what happens while you wait for a decision.</p>

<p>You can find out about <a href="https://www.juridischloket.nl/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">legal assistance</a> (in Dutch) and <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/bescherming-van-consumenten/vraag-en-antwoord/waar-kan-ik-terecht-voor-hulp-bij-een-juridisch-probleem-of-conflict" class="govuk-link" rel="external">financial assistance</a> (in Dutch).</p>

<p>You may be eligible for <a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/brexit/vraag-en-antwoord/wanneer-heb-ik-recht-op-bijzondere-bijstand" rel="external" class="govuk-link">financial assistance from your municipality</a> if you have incurred extra costs due to your residency document application.</p>

<h3>Late applications</h3>

<p>The deadline for&nbsp;applying for an Article 50 TEU residence document was 30 September 2021. If you were in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021 and have not applied, there will be <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/news/Pages/End-of-'grace-period'-for-Britons-without-Brexit-residence-document.aspx" class="govuk-link">consequences for your rights and ability to access benefits in the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>You can still <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Brexit-%28UK-Withdrawal-Agreement%29.aspx" class="govuk-link">apply for an Article 50 TEU residence document</a> until 1 October 2022. If your application is approved, your rights are reinstated retrospectively and you can continue to live lawfully in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>If you have not applied for an Article 50 TEU residence document for your children , you should apply on their behalf before 1 October 2022. After this date, they can apply for their own Article 50 TEU residence document when they turn 18 years old.</p>

<p>If you have questions about making an application, call the&nbsp;<abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> general helpline on +31 (0)88 04 30410.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>If you have been granted an Article 50 TEU residence document, your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in the Netherlands at any point in the future. Find more information on who this applies to in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Family members with UK nationality may travel to the Netherlands and then <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Family-reunification-after-Brexit.aspx" rel="external">apply for a residence document&nbsp;as your family member</a>.</p>

<p>Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.netherlandsandyou.nl/travel-and-residence/visas-for-the-netherlands/visa-facilitation" rel="external">the visa facilitation process</a>.</p>

<p>After they receive a letter from the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> to acknowledge receipt of their residence document application, your family members can <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/personal-records-database-brp" rel="external" class="govuk-link">register in the&nbsp;Personal Records Database</a> (Basisregistratie Personen&nbsp;or BRP) at the town hall.</p>

<p>Family members with EU, EEA or Swiss nationality do not&nbsp;need a residence document or permit to live and work in the Netherlands and do not need to report to the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport in the Netherlands</a>. Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">travel advice for the Netherlands</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/default/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU / European Free Trade Area (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave the Netherlands using your EU / EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in the Netherlands with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside the Netherlands, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, especially within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/default/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" rel="external">Schengen area</a>, carry your Article 50 TEU residence document or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in the Netherlands, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is incorrectly stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement you do not need any extra months on your passport to enter or exit EU countries.</p>
