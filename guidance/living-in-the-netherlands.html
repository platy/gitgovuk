<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>. You must apply for a new residence status by 30 June 2021 to secure your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<h3>Citizen service number (BSN)</h3>

<p>Everyone living in the Netherlands must have a citizen service number, often referred to as a BSN (burgerservicenummer). You must register with your local municipality (gemeente) to obtain a citizen service number (BSN).</p>

<p>You must apply for a BSN within 5 days of arriving in the Netherlands. You will need to make an appointment with the municipality (gemeente) where you live. Your local gemeenteâ€™s website provides information on how to book an appointment and what documentation you will need.</p>

<p>You need a BSN for many administrative procedures in the Netherlands, including working, opening a bank account, arranging health insurance, visiting a doctor or hospital, or applying benefits.</p>

<p>Read the Dutch governmentâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/citizen-service-number-bsn">guidance about BSN numbers</a>.</p>

<h3>Registering in the Personal Records Database</h3>

<p>Every resident of the Netherlands must be registered in the Personal Records Database, referred to as the BRP (Basisregistratie Personen) which is held by the local municipality  (gemeente). You may request to do this at the same time as you apply for your BSN.</p>

<p>If you move house, you should make sure you re-register again at your new address. The <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> and other government bodies will use the BRP to contact you.</p>

<p>If you leave the Netherlands to become resident elsewhere, you must deregister from the BRP before you leave the Netherlands. If you move back to the Netherlands, you will need to register at your local gemeente and you will be assigned the same BSN as you had before.</p>

<h3>The new residency document</h3>

<p>If you are legally resident in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021, you will need to apply for a new residency document to secure your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>You must submit your application for the new document by 30 June 2021. If you have been living in the Netherlands for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>less than 5 years, <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Apply-for-a-temporary-residence-document.aspx" class="govuk-link">apply for a temporary residency document</a>
</li>
  <li>over 5 years consecutively, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Apply-for-a-permanent-residence-document.aspx">apply for a permanent residency document</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions about making an application, call the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>â€™s helpline for UK nationals, on +31 (0)88 04 30410, to discuss your personal situation.</p>

<p>Before starting your online application, make sure that you have all the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Apply-for-a-temporary-residence-document.aspx#7907af3b-5e55-400a-bbbc-569e9c44e919" class="govuk-link">DigiD with sms code</a> or DigiD app. If you do not yet have a DigiD, apply for it on <a href="https://www.digid.nl/en/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">www.digid.nl/en</a>. You should also read about the <a rel="external" href="https://www.digid.nl/en/login-methods/digid-app/" class="govuk-link">DigiD app</a> (in Dutch and English)</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.ideal.nl/en/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">iDEAL</a> (online payment method) to pay for your application. You need a Dutch bank account to set this up</li>
  <li>a copy of the pages of your passport showing your personal details and period of validity</li>
  <li>a copy of any other documents you need to upload. Read the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> guidance on what documents you will need for <a href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Apply-for-a-temporary-residence-document.aspx#documents" rel="external" class="govuk-link">temporary residency</a> or for <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Apply-for-a-permanent-residence-document.aspx#documents" class="govuk-link">permanent residency</a>
</li>
  <li>BSN number</li>
  <li>(optional) V-number: this is the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>â€™s unique identification number, you can find it on correspondence from the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> about your residency rights</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also apply by downloading a paper version of the application form from the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> website and posting it to the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can submit an application for other family members within the same household at the same time as your own. You need their documents to do so.</p>

<p>If you moved to the Netherlands in late 2020, you need to keep a range of evidence that you arrived with intention to live there. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a travel document</li>
  <li>rental receipt for a property</li>
  <li>a registration to demonstrate you are seeking a job</li>
</ul>

<h3>Decision on your application and biometrics</h3>

<p>When you submit an application for residency, you will receive a letter from the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>, that is your â€˜certificate of applicationâ€™.</p>

<p>After you have applied, you will need to make an appointment to have your biometrics taken. You do not have to wait for a decision on your application before you have your biometrics taken. The <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> will take your fingerprints, a photo of you and your signature. You can choose to book your appointment at an <a href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Biometrics-appointment-after-Brexit.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> desk or at an expat centre</a>. The appointment can be booked online, but you will need to attend in person.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Biometrics-appointment-after-Brexit.aspx"><abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> guidance on biometric appointments and how to book one</a>.</p>

<p>You will receive a decision on your application through your <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Message-Box.aspx">DigiD message box</a> (Berichtenbox). The decision will be written in Dutch.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> aims to provide your biometric residency card within 2 weeks of your biometric appointment. Read the Dutch government <a href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on how you will receive your residency card</a> (open the Brexit tab under â€˜Frequently asked questions about the effects of the coronavirusâ€™).</p>

<p>You must always carry photo ID, as a legal requirement. You can use your passport or your new residency card.</p>

<h3>Other residency documents</h3>

<p>If you have a valid EU residence document (duurzaam verblijf), exchange it for a new residence card by making a biometric appointment. Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Living-in-the-Netherlands-after-Brexit.aspx#EU_duurzaam"><abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> guidance on how to exchange EU residency documents</a>.</p>

<p>If you are currently away from the Netherlands, and you havenâ€™t provided your address, the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> will not be able to contact you to arrange the exchange. To discuss your circumstances and what you need to do, call the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>â€™s information line for UK nationals on: +31 (0)88 04 30410.</p>

<h3>Dutch nationality or other EU nationalities</h3>

<p>If you have Dutch citizenship or a valid Dutch national residence permit, you donâ€™t need a new residence document. If you have a Type II residency permit, you can also apply for the new residency status if you want to. However, you can only have one residency document.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Living-in-the-Netherlands-after-Brexit.aspx#3"><abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> guidance on residency rights</a>.</p>

<h2>Studying</h2>

<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Dutch nationals, as long as you were legally resident in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021. You must apply for the new residency permit.</p>

<p>Dependent on your circumstances you must either;</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for a new UK issued EHIC</li>
  <li>purchase private health insurance, or</li>
  <li>purchase basic Dutch health insurance (basis verzekering), if you work, intern or volunteer whilst studying (as legally required to do so)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Moving to the Netherlands to study</h3>

<p>If you are planning to study in the Netherlands, make sure you meet all visa requirements before you arrive. Contact the relevant Higher Education provider to check what fees you may have to pay.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://duo.nl/particulier/home/actueel/gevolgen-brexit-consequences-of-brexit.jsp" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Dutch governmentâ€™s guidance on tuition fees from 1 January 2021 (in Dutch and English)</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in the Netherlands. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in the Netherlands, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the Netherlands.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to the Netherlands, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queuing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards the 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland will not change.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you move to the Netherlands, you must arrange <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/health-insurance" rel="external" class="govuk-link">health insurance</a> within 4 months of your arrival. The basic Dutch health insurance (basis verzekering) covers general medical care, such as visits to a local GP and hospital care. You can read guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.zorgverzekering.org/eng/" class="govuk-link">health insurance in the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a resident and purchase basic Dutch health insurance, your access to healthcare will not change.</p>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-netherlands">guidance on healthcare in the Netherlands</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to the Netherlands temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-netherlands#posted-worker">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in the Netherlands and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-netherlands#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on using an S1 form in the Netherlands</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in the Netherlands, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC for healthcare in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>If you were living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in the Netherlands</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" rel="external">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>
