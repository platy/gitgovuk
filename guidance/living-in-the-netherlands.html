<h2>If you were living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you were living in the Netherlands since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Dutch government and your local authority. You should also read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/travel-advice-help-and-support" class="govuk-link">Netherlands travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in the Netherlands, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the&nbsp;UK&nbsp;government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirement for the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Living-in-the-Netherlands-after-Brexit.aspx#2" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Immigration and Naturalisation Service (<abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>) guidance</a> on the types of residence permit you can apply for as a â€˜third country nationalâ€™ who wants to move to the Netherlands. You are a â€˜third country nationalâ€™ if you moved to the Netherlands after 1 January 2021 and you do not have EU, EEA or Swiss nationality.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, by law, you must always carry photo ID, for example your passport or residence permit.</p>

<h3>Citizen service number (BSN)</h3>

<p>Everyone living in the Netherlands must have their own citizen service number, referred to as a BSN (burgerservicenummer). You need a BSN for many administrative procedures in the Netherlands, including working, opening a bank account, arranging health insurance, visiting a doctor or hospital, or applying for benefits. Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/citizen-service-number-bsn">Dutch governmentâ€™s guidance about BSNs</a>.</p>

<p>Within 5 days of arriving in the Netherlands, you must make an appointment with your local municipality (gemeente) to request registration in the Personal Records Database BRP (Basisregistratie Personen). Your local municipalityâ€™s website provides information on how to book an appointment and what documentation you will need. You will get a BSN when you are registered in the BRP.</p>

<p>You must be registered in the BRP at the correct address. The <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> and other government bodies will use the BRP to contact you. If you move house, you must register with the municipality that you move to.</p>

<p>If you leave the Netherlands to become resident elsewhere, you must deregister from the BRP before you leave. If you move back to the Netherlands, you will need to register at your local municipality and you will be given the same BSN again.</p>

<h3>Working for an international organisation</h3>

<p>If you work for an international organisation, you must check with your organisationâ€™s HR department for advice about your stay in the Netherlands. Each international organisation has an agreement with the Dutch government about their staff. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.government.nl/documents/leaflets/2012/12/01/protocol-guide-for-international-organisations">general protocol guide</a> with practical information based on their interpretation of the rules for privileged persons.</p>

<p>If you previously worked for an international organisation and you wish to continue living in the Netherlands, read the Dutch government guidance on <a href="https://ind.nl/en/permanent-residence/Pages/formerly-privileged-and-their-family-members.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">how to apply for a permanent residence permit as an â€˜ex-privilegedâ€™ person</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you applied for your new residence document (â€˜Article 50 TEU (Treaty on European Union) residence documentâ€™) by 30 September 2021, your rights are protected by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> pending a decision on your application. There are 2 types of residence status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>temporary <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Apply-for-permanent-residency-after-Brexit.aspx" class="govuk-link">living in the Netherlands for less than 5 years</a>
</li>
  <li>permanent <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Apply-for-permanent-residency-after-Brexit.aspx">living in the Netherlands for 5 years or more</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a temporary Article 50 TEU residence document, you can apply for a permanent residence document after living lawfully for 5 consecutive years in the Netherlands. You do not need to wait for your temporary residence document to expire, as it is valid for 5 years from when your residence status was granted. Permanent residency status provides additional rights, so you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Apply-for-permanent-residency-after-Brexit.aspx" rel="external">apply as soon as you can demonstrate 5 years of lawful residence in the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<h3>Decision on your application and biometrics</h3>

<p>When you apply for an Article 50 TEU residence document, you will receive a letter from the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>. This letter is your â€˜certificate of applicationâ€™, which you should carry with you, especially when travelling.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> will contact you if they need more information about your application.  When a decision has been made, you will receive a further <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> letter about making an appointment to have your biometrics taken.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Biometrics-appointment-after-Brexit.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> guidance on biometric appointments and how to book one</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/contact/Pages/contact.aspx">Contact the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> if you need to discuss your application</a>.</p>

<h3>Appeals process</h3>

<p>If your application for a new residence document is refused, you will be notified about the appeals process. Read the Dutch governmentâ€™s advice on&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/objection-and-appeal.aspx" class="govuk-link">how to appeal a residency decision</a>. This includes information about time limits for submitting an appeal and what happens while you wait for a decision.</p>

<p>You can find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.juridischloket.nl/" rel="external">legal assistance</a> (in Dutch) and <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/bescherming-van-consumenten/vraag-en-antwoord/waar-kan-ik-terecht-voor-hulp-bij-een-juridisch-probleem-of-conflict">financial assistance</a> (in Dutch).</p>

<p>You may be eligible for <a rel="external" href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/brexit/vraag-en-antwoord/wanneer-heb-ik-recht-op-bijzondere-bijstand" class="govuk-link">financial assistance from your municipality</a> if you have incurred extra costs due to your residency document application.</p>

<h3>Late applications</h3>

<p>The deadline for&nbsp;applying for an Article 50 TEU residence document was 30 September 2021. If you were living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021 and have not applied, the Dutch authorities will treat you as being in the country illegally. There are serious <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/news/Pages/End-of-'grace-period'-for-Britons-without-Brexit-residence-document.aspx">consequences for your rights and ability to access benefits in the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>The Dutch Governmentâ€™s flexible policy means you can still <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Brexit-%28UK-Withdrawal-Agreement%29.aspx">apply for an Article 50 TEU residence document</a> until 1 October 2022. If you have not yet applied, you should do so as soon as possible. If your application is approved, your rights are reinstated retrospectively and you can continue to live lawfully in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>If you have not applied for an Article 50 TEU residence document for your children, you should apply on their behalf as soon as possible, and before 1 October 2022. After this date, children can only apply for their own Article 50 TEU residence document when they turn 18 years old.</p>

<p>If you have questions about making an application <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/contact/Pages/contact.aspx">contact the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>If you have been granted an Article 50 TEU residence document, your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in the Netherlands at any point in the future. Find more information on who this applies to in the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Family members with UK nationality may travel to the Netherlands and then <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Family-reunification-after-Brexit.aspx" rel="external">apply for a residence document&nbsp;as your family member</a>. Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Dutch authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<p>After they receive a letter from the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> to acknowledge receipt of their residence document application, your family members can <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/personal-records-database-brp" class="govuk-link" rel="external">register in the&nbsp;Personal Records Database</a> (Basisregistratie Personen&nbsp;or BRP) at the town hall.</p>

<p>Family members with EU, EEA or Swiss nationality do not&nbsp;need a residence document or permit to live and work in the Netherlands and do not need to report to the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your former EU residence document (duurzaam verblijf) is no longer valid. If you had one, you should have exchanged it for an Article 50 TEU residence document. You can apply for this residence document until 1 October 2022.</p>

<h3>Other forms of residence</h3>

<p>You do not need an Article 50 TEU residence document if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have Dutch citizenship or EU citizenship with a valid Dutch national residence document, or</li>
  <li>work for an international organisation, as long as you remain employed by that organisation. Your residence rights, and your privileges and immunities under the relevant host agreement do not change. However, if you wish to apply for an Article 50 TEU residence document, consult your legal and HR departments, as this may affect your privileges and immunities. If you wish to apply for an Article 50 TEU you should do so by 1 October 2022.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a Type II residency document issued under the Aliens Act, you have additional residency status under the Withdrawal Agreement. The <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> will provide more information on this at <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/My-IND.aspx">mijnind.nl</a>. Whilst you can have 2 statuses, you can only have 1 residence document. You can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep your Type II permanent residence document, if it has not expired, or</li>
  <li>exchange it for an Article 50 TEU residence document, provided it has not been withdrawn. You will need to pay a fee to exchange it</li>
</ul>

<p>To discuss your circumstances <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/contact/Pages/contact.aspx" rel="external">contact the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a href="##Cornavirus" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from the Netherlands.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/entry-requirements#passport-validity" class="govuk-link">Netherlands travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Area (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave the Netherlands using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in the Netherlands with a Dutch residence permit or long-stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside the Netherlands, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist" class="govuk-link">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in the Netherlands before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel carry your Article 50 TEU residence document or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in the Netherlands, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit your host country with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>
