<p>Central government organisations, including departments and the bodies they sponsor, must obtain Cabinet Office approval when they want to spend money on specified activities.</p>

<p>This control is one of a set of controls included in the policy paper <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls-version-6/cabinet-office-controls-policy-version-6">Cabinet Office controls policy: version 6</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Details are provided of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the types of services covered by the consultancy and professional services (<abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr>) spending control and how these differ from the separate spending control covering Contingent Labour contracts</li>
  <li>the contract value and duration thresholds at which the control applies</li>
  <li>and the authorisation arrangements</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications for consent under this control are made on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cpsp.mendixcloud.com/" rel="external">Consultancy and Professional Services Portal</a>. Contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a> if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>1. Policy</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> control’s purpose is to ensure that relevant People and Commercial standards are being met when organisations procure <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr>. It contributes to the Government Consulting Hub’s aims to: ensure consultants should only be engaged where in-house skills are not available; help reduce spend on consultancy; maximise the value achieved where consultants are genuinely needed; and upskill permanent staff to deliver consultancy-type work.</p>

<h2>2. Scope</h2>

<p>The organisations and spending classifications in scope for this control.</p>

<h3>2.1 Which organisations must apply?</h3>

<p>The control covers spending on  <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> by all organisations classified as being in central government by the Office of National Statistics in their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/economicstatisticsclassifications/introductiontoeconomicstatisticsclassifications" rel="external">Public Sector Classifications guide</a>.</p>

<p>Other organisations may be in scope through legislation or agreement. Further details on this can be obtained from the Cabinet Office Controls Team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>2.2 Spending classifications - service type?</h3>

<h4>Consultancy services</h4>

<p>These are services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that provide advice to fill a knowledge gap. This can be to identify options and recommendations, or advice to assist with implementing solutions; it will usually be related to business change or transformation, so will be time-limited</li>
  <li>where the individuals (consultants) delivering the service (output) will operate outside of the client organisation’s structure and staffing establishment</li>
  <li>where payment is based on the delivery of a defined service (output). This may require a team of consultants working for an extended period of time, or could require a single consultant whose fee will be calculated based on the time taken to deliver the output</li>
  <li>that should not involve the individuals (consultants) working in a Business as Usual environment  (eg. advising on legal risk or technical matters). Such contracts should usually be categorised as professional services, rather than consultancy services</li>
</ul>

<h4>Professional Services</h4>

<p>These are services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that are not defined as consultancy</li>
  <li>that are not purely or mostly advisory (unless the advice is part of a formal report  that is required to undertake business as usual activities eg. a legal opinion or technical report)</li>
  <li>where the individuals delivering the service (output) will operate outside the client organisation’s structure and staffing establishment</li>
  <li>where payment is generally based on the delivery of defined outputs or outcomes (eg. task and finish work)</li>
  <li>that, as with consultancy, deliver a service (output) that may require a team working for an extended period of time, or may be provided by an individual whose fee will be calculated based on the time taken to deliver the service</li>
  <li>that are often delivered in a <abbr title="business as usual">BAU</abbr> environment, but may relate to the delivery of a project or programme.  They can be responsible for a non-<abbr title="business as usual">BAU</abbr> output (eg. legal advisers recruited to provide advice on a specific issue)</li>
  <li>that seek to fill gaps to assist the procuring organisation to deliver or implement an operational service, including those that are <abbr title="business as usual">BAU</abbr>. As such, professional services should not be purely (or mostly) advisory and contracts should be defined according to the delivery of outputs and deliverables rather than the number of days of effort utilised</li>
  <li>where for the purposes of the control  there is no need for individuals to demonstrate any specific skills, qualifications or experience</li>
  <li>where contractors can be paid according to time worked or for delivery of a defined output or service. This can  include  Managed Services (MS)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managed Service or Business Process Outsourcing?</h4>

<p>A MS is defined as a team of people who have been engaged to do a specified piece of work. This is not where a third party supplier has been contracted to deliver an entire business process referred to as Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). Compared to BPO, MS contracts tend to be lower value, involve fewer workers and be shorter term.  MS also tend to be managed within the department or central government body, whereas BPO are externally managed day-to-day and report to the department or central government body using Key Performance Indicators defined in the contract.  For the sake of simplicity, if in doubt organisations may assume that such contracts are classified as MS if they are under £10m in value, or BPO if not.</p>

<h3>2.3. What spending is out of scope ?</h3>

<p>The control does not cover spending on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contingent labour, as defined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contingent-labour-spend-control">Contingent Labour Spend Control</a>
</li>
  <li>staff Loans or secondments from other organisations</li>
  <li>fixed-term employment contracts (irrespective of length)</li>
  <li>Digital Outcomes and Specialist contracts (DOS), which fall within the scope of the Digital and Technology spending control</li>
  <li>capital expenditure on <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> (to create, purchase, upgrade, or extend the life of an asset). This exclusion does not include expenditure on activities related to an asset that should be categorised as RDEL expenditure budget. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1061788/CBG_2022-23.pdf" rel="external">Read Chapter 7 of the Consolidated budgeting guidance 2022 to 2023 for further information</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Business process outsourcing (BPO), whereby a third party supplier is contracted to deliver an entire business process. Spending on BPO may be referred to the Cabinet Office under one of the other spending controls if appropriate (eg. the Commercial or Digital and Technology controls).</p>

<p>Where your organisation has thresholds higher than £10 million for these other controls, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a> for further advice and signposting.</p>

<h3>2.4 Other considerations</h3>

<h4>Alternative assurance</h4>

<p>Spending on some types of specialist <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> is already assured and approved under other control and/or assurance arrangements operated by the Cabinet Office and other departments. Currently this encompasses certain Legal, Digital and Data Specialists spend. The <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> control team will take an  overall assessment of  an Organisation’s Governance arrangements  on a case by case basis via submissions using the online portal.</p>

<h4>Mixed contracts with a value of less than £10 million</h4>

<p>These are contracts that contain significant elements that are covered by the scope, and trigger the thresholds, of different Cabinet Office spending controls (eg. a contract that contains both consultancy and spend on property leases). In such cases, you should apply the spending control that relates to the largest share of the total contract spend (Cabinet Office’s controls teams will then liaise to provide you with a single approval decision). Exceptions to this are: Where this would result in <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> spending not being reviewed by Cabinet Office under any control (eg. where spending on a commercial contract under £10 million has an element of consultancy exceeding the <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> control thresholds). Such cases should be referred to the <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> controls team if their share exceeds the £600 thousand or 9 month threshold.</p>

<h4>Mixed <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> contracts over £10 million in value</h4>

<p>Should be referred to the Cabinet Office as Commercial spending, Digital Data and Technology or Property control under the arrangements specified in the relevant control’s guidance, available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cabinet-office-controls-version-6/cabinet-office-controls-policy-version-6#summary-expenditure">Cabinet Office controls policy: version 6</a>.</p>

<p>For details of how <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> are classified, and subclassifications, please consult the Crown Commercial Service’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-areas-of-spend-data-definitions">Common Areas of Spend Definitions</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Applying for consent</h2>

<h3>3.1. <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> control thresholds</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> control operates using the following thresholds.</p>

<h4>Contracts of or over £120,000 in value or at least 3 months in duration, but below £600,000 or 9 months in duration</h4>

<p>These should be approved by the spending organisation’s Minister (for government departments) or Accounting Officer /Chief Executive Officer for other central government bodies.  The contract duration should include any options for extensions. Organisations  must notify the  Cabinet Office of the contracts approved in this way using the online portal. You do not require Cabinet Office’s approval for such contracts, and the requirement for you to notify such cases is to enable the collection of data on all cases approved under the delegated arrangements.</p>

<h4>Contracts of or above £600,000 or 9 months in duration (including any options for extension)</h4>

<p>These should, in addition to the above approval, also receive approval from the Cabinet Office. Organisations should submit these cases using the online portal.</p>

<h4>Contracts of £10 million and above</h4>

<p>These will need to be referred to the Cabinet Office via the Commercial control for approval. Please see guidance at this link. Cabinet Office’s Strategy, Assurance and Standards Commercial Continuous Improvement Team will liaise with the central controls team, incorporating the <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> control team’s consideration of risks and issues specific to the procurement of  consultancy and professional services, to provide clearance covering both the Commercial and <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> spending controls. However, these contracts should still be disclosed against the <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> spend control via the online portal (see section 6).</p>

<h3>3.2. VAT treatment</h3>

<p>The control thresholds and the contract values are both inclusive of non recoverable VAT. Current HMRC guidance and the advice of finance professionals in organisations should be sought in deciding the correct VAT treatment. If there is a lack of clarity, or an unresolved query in relation to the correct treatment, the VAT inclusive (gross) amount should be used to decide whether the contract is at or above a threshold.</p>

<h3>3.3 Contract duration and worked days</h3>

<p>Some contracts run for relatively long durations but only require a small number of days / hours work over this period (e.g. where an expert consultant is contracted to provide a few days of advice at key points over a long-term programme of work.  In such cases the contract duration may trigger the spending control even though the contract spend is below the value threshold. Where the Cabinet Office’s approval is required the number  of days and time scale  should be noted in the case description fields on the online portal. This will be taken into consideration when the case is being assessed.</p>

<h3>3.4.Extensions</h3>

<p>This covers 4 scenarios for extensions that were not included when the case was originally approved.</p>

<h4>Existing contract previously below the £120,000 or 3 month threshold is extended so that its total value /duration exceeds the threshold</h4>

<p>This must be approved by the spending organisation’s Minister, Accounting Officer or Chief Executive Officer.</p>

<p>Organisations must  notify the Cabinet Office of the contracts approved in this way using the online portal.</p>

<h4>Existing contract that was previously below the £600,000 or 9 month threshold is extended so that its total value/duration exceeds the threshold</h4>

<p>This must also be approved by the Cabinet Office.</p>

<p>Organisations should submit a case for approval  using the online portal.</p>

<h4>Existing contract that previously triggered the £120,000 or 3 month threshold is amended or extended</h4>

<p>If the amendment is material, usually the  total value increases by 10% or more or the duration is increased by at least 3 months, but is still below the £600,000 or 9 month threshold in total, it must be approved by the spending organisation’s Minister , Accounting Officer or Chief Executive Officer as appropriate to the Organisation’s governance structure.</p>

<p>Organisations must  notify the Cabinet Office of the contracts approved in this way using the online portal.</p>

<h4>Existing contract that previously triggered the £600,000 or 9 month threshold is amended or extended: If you assess the amendment to be material, or the total value increases by 10%, or duration at least 3 months</h4>

<p>Organisations should submit a case for approval  using the online portal.</p>

<h4>What if the original consent was issued prior to the introduction of the <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> control on 1 October 2021?</h4>

<p>If the extension to the original  contract value is to be increased by 10% or more, or the contract duration is to be increased by 3 months or more, then these changes should be taken in totality when determining if the extended contract comes into scope of the control.</p>

<p>Organisations should submit a case for approval as a new request using the online portal. .</p>

<h3>3.3 Frameworks and call-offs</h3>

<p>A ‘framework agreement’ is ‘an agreement between one or more contracting authorities and one or more providers, the purpose of which is to establish the terms governing contracts to be awarded during a given period, in particular with regard to price.</p>

<p>Frameworks that trigger the control thresholds should be submitted for approval . It should be clear from the title and description of the submission that the disclosure / approval request relates to the establishing of a new framework. The values / durations referred to  should be the levels that would occur under maximum utilisation of that framework.</p>

<p>Individual ‘call-off’ contracts under framework agreements (including those under frameworks previously approved under the controls) should also receive spending control approval at the stages and levels.</p>

<h2>4. The spending control process</h2>

<h3>4.1 Milestones</h3>

<p>Spending organisations should submit cases (for notification or approval as appropriate) via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cpsp.mendixcloud.com" rel="external">online portal</a>  in accordance with the following milestones.</p>

<h4>Outline Business Case (OBC) - approval to go to market</h4>

<p>Submit cases above the £600,000 or 9 months threshold to the Cabinet Office for approval at the OBC stage.</p>

<p>Complete all the information fields, including specifying who provided internal approval from the department or  central government body. This approval must be from the level related to the  spending control threshold  and cannot be delegated.</p>

<h4>Full Business Case (FBC) - approval to award contract</h4>

<p>Submit cases above the £600,000 or 9 months threshold to the Cabinet Office for approval at the FBC stage. This should follow an earlier  submission  of  information on the case at the OBC stage (and  a case reference will already have been  issued by the online portal). An update now will  reflect the contract value and any changes since the OBC approval was received.</p>

<h4>Where increases to the contract’s duration or value trigger the £600,000 or 9 month threshold, where this was not previously triggered</h4>

<p>These cases must be referred to the Cabinet Office for approval.</p>

<h4>Contracts that have already received Cabinet Office’s approval</h4>

<p>Where contracts have already received Cabinet Office’s approval (that is, they previously triggered the £600,000 or 9 month threshold) but changes are now deemed  to be substantial or material, a refreshed approval should be sought.</p>

<h4>Where there are no material changes to the proposals between OBC and FBC</h4>

<p>If your internal approver to the  FBC agrees, then you do not need to seek repeat approval.</p>

<h3>4.2 No business case available</h3>

<p>If using programme milestones, and a project or programme management approach, with no available  OBC or FBC documentation, please  contact the Cabinet Office mailbox at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a> to agree a suitable point at which to refer your case for approval.</p>

<p>For contracts approved under your delegated arrangements (ie. under the £600,000 or 9 month threshold) central government organisations are permitted to develop and implement their own internal processes to achieve the required approval as efficiently as possible (eg. routine cases for Ministerial / AO / CEO approval could be batched with a recommendation from a senior official, approval  board or other equivalent body for final approval).</p>

<p>Internal approval processes should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be in line with guidance set out in the Consultancy Playbook on how to commission and engage with consultants more effectively, achieving better outcomes, better value for money and improved Civil Service capability through the transfer of knowledge and skills.</li>
  <li>ensure that spending on <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> is in line with your organisation’s workforce strategy for how it plans to use permanent staff rather than consultants and professional services where this is possible and represents value.</li>
  <li>include consideration of whether there is a suitable Crown Commercial Service (CCS) framework agreement, which provides an efficient route to market whilst allowing users to reduce cost, mitigate risk and maintain delivery assurance. CCS has a range of frameworks for consultancy, including but not limited to: Management Consultancy Framework MCF3. If there are other frameworks your organisation uses, eg. for recruitment of sector specialists, which are more relevant to the context of the contract, these should be identified</li>
</ul>

<h4>Timing</h4>

<p>The underlying principle is that spending plans should be referred before a commitment to procure is made and before spend is entered into with a contractor; for cases requiring Cabinet Office’s approval, you should allow time for assurance and approval, including time to respond to Cabinet Office’s questions or feedback on the proposed spending. The required seniority levels for internal authorisation will still apply.</p>

<h4>Assurance criteria</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> spending control assures cases against criteria based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-sourcing-and-consultancy-playbooks">Sourcing and Consultancy Playbooks</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-operating-standards-for-government">Commercial Functional Standard</a>. These are distilled into the following ‘tests’:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Problem definition - is there a clear understanding of outcomes the engagement is aiming to achieve, and are deliverables towards these articulated?</li>
  <li>Need for consultancy - have other delivery models, including in-house and other options from the market, been adequately considered?</li>
  <li>Sourcing to achieve VfM - has a proportionate level of market engagement taken place and was/is the procurement process robust and appropriate?</li>
  <li>Knowledge and skills to avoid over reliance - are the plans adequate for how results will be used and shared more widely, skills will be passed on and how over-reliance on single providers will be avoided?</li>
  <li>Timing and Planning - has sufficient time been allowed for recommendations to be implemented, and have other functions been adequately engaged at the start?</li>
  <li>Management and Oversight - is there an effective focus on ensuring the contract delivers its objectives and outcomes sufficiently in the planned timescale?</li>
  <li>Social Impact - is there sufficient evidence that social value requirements are complied with and appropriate metrics are being used?</li>
</ol>

<p>The criteria the Cabinet Office will use to assess cases against these tests will vary according to the nature and context of the <abbr title="Consultancy and professional services">C&amp;PS</abbr> requirement, and it is possible that other criteria may be considered if appropriate.</p>

<p>The portal allows you to attach a business case or equivalent document  and allows reference to be made to this  in several data fields rather than re- keying information.</p>

<h5>Must I always enter all requested information?</h5>

<p>GDPR rules apply.  Where a spending proposal contains information with a security classification of SECRET or above, Organisations should not use the portal. Sensitive details can be redacted on the portal submission then the case should be discussed directly with the Cabinet Office controls team, who will facilitate assessment.</p>

<h4>How do I monitor my case?</h4>

<p>Once you have entered the required information, you will be issued with a case reference and access code. This will enable you to check on your case’s progress and update information as required. If your case requires Cabinet Office approval (it triggers the £600,000 or 9 month threshold) you will receive a decision on whether the case is approved within 10 working days. Where the Cabinet Office controls team needs to ask you for further information the ‘clock stops’ and restarts when you have provided adequate information.</p>

<h4>Urgent cases?</h4>

<p>The ‘further information’ section of the online portal will ask you whether your case is urgent. Please select ‘yes’ where you require urgent approval in less time than the 10 working day standard. If you would like to discuss the urgent case prior to, or when submitting, please email the Cabinet Office controls team</p>

<p>Contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">cabinetofficecontrols@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a> for further information or to discuss any issues you have in applying this spending control.</p>
