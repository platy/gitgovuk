<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Hungary.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-hungary">Sign up for email alerts</a></p>
</div>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>This information is about living in Hungary. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Hungary</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The Hungarian state healthcare system is funded by the National Health Insurance Fund (Országos Egészségbiztosítási Pénztár (OEP)).</p>

<p>Most healthcare is free if you’re making social security contributions, but you may have to pay for some things, such as medicines and medical equipment.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Hungarian healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying social security contributions</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays when studying, or as a ‘posted’ (detached) worker</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued S1 form with the National Health Insurance Fund (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Hungary’ below)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Hungary</h2>

<p>If you are planning on moving to Hungary, see the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-hungary" class="govuk-link">Living in Hungary</a> for more information about visa and residency requirements.</p>

<p>You must show proof of healthcare cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before you can register as a resident</li>
  <li>when you apply for a visa</li>
</ul>

<p>For details about the healthcare cover required for residency applications, contact local authorities in Hungary or the appropriate Hungarian embassy or consulate in the UK.</p>

<p>Once you start making social security contributions, you’ll be automatically registered with the National Health Insurance Fund and entitled to state healthcare.  Your dependants will also be entitled to state healthcare.</p>

<p>If you’re employed, your employer will arrange for you to pay social security contributions.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, you need to register yourself at your local tax and customs office.</p>

<p>If you are not making social security contributions and you are not someone’s dependant, you need to take out private health insurance.</p>

<p>You need a GP to refer you before seeing a specialist or having a non-emergency hospital appointment.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Hungarian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a UK S1 if you start drawing a UK State Pension (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Hungary’ below).</p>

<h3>How to register for healthcare</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-hungary">Register as a resident.</a></p>

<p>Arrange to pay social security contributions. If you’re employed by a Hungarian employer, they’ll deduct your contributions from your wages.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, you need to arrange to pay voluntary contributions. You can do this through your local <a rel="external" href="https://en.nav.gov.hu/" class="govuk-link">tax and customs office</a>.</p>

<p>Get a healthcare card called a ‘TAJ card’ from your regional governmental office (kormányablak).</p>

<p>Register with a GP in your district that has a contract with the National Health Insurance Fund. Bring your TAJ card.</p>

<p>You should carry your TAJ card with you and show it when you visit a doctor.</p>

<h3>How to access healthcare services</h3>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://okfo.gov.hu/egeszsegugyi-intezmenyek">Find your nearest hospital or clinic</a> on the National Healthcare Service Center website (Hungarian language website, can translate into English).</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>Most healthcare is free if you’re making social security contributions and you’ve registered with a GP.</p>

<p>You need to show your TAJ card to show that you’re registered with the National Health Insurance Fund.</p>

<p>You usually need to pay part of the cost of medicines and medical appliances.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Hungary temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Hungary using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Hungary</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance if you have an S1 as a ‘posted worker’ (see ‘If your UK employer has sent you to Hungary temporarily (‘posted workers’)’ above).</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a resident in Hungary and receive a UK State Pension or an exportable benefit. See <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/planning-your-healthcare/" class="govuk-link">Planning your healthcare abroad</a> on the NHS website for more information about eligibility.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it with the Hungarian National Health Insurance Fund.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Hungary on the same basis as a Hungarian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/global-health-insurance-card"><abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" rel="external">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Hungary than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<p>If you’re entitled to an S1 form as a dependant of a State Pensioner, your health cover will be cancelled once you begin claiming your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You will be sent a new S1 form to your registered address from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services. You must register this form to ensure continuation of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>You are responsible for informing NHS Overseas Healthcare Services if you change your address or your circumstances change.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services  
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension or another qualifying exportable benefit, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services (see contact details above).</p>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Hungary</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 form with the National Health Insurance Fund.</p>

<p>You also need to get a healthcare card called a TAJ card from your regional governmental office (kormányablak).</p>

<p>Register with a GP in your district that has a contract with the National Health Insurance Fund.</p>

<p>Your records will be updated to say that you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Hungarian citizen.</p>

<p>Show your TAJ card whenever you access healthcare services.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>If you are experiencing delays registering your S1 with local authorities and require emergency or urgent treatment, contact the Overseas Healthcare Services on 0044 191 218 1999.</p>
</div>

<h2>Studying in Hungary</h2>
<p>You should apply for a Student <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> to get medically necessary, state-provided healthcare for the duration of your study period in Hungary, whether this is for part or all of your course. This means that you’ll get necessary healthcare services on the same basis as a Hungarian citizen either for free or at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>If you already hold a valid Student <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> you can use this until the card expires.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Read more about eligibility and how to apply</a></p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Because the NHS is a residency-based system, under NHS rules UK nationals who move abroad on a permanent basis may lose their entitlement to free NHS healthcare.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national and move to the EU, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK unless you have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, PRC or S2 to show your healthcare costs are funded by the EU country in which you now live, or another exemption applies.</p>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK war pensioners</li>
  <li>UK government employees</li>
  <li>UK nationals living in the EU on or before 31 December 2020, once they have a registered, UK-issued S1</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about using the NHS when you no longer live in the UK (see ‘UK nationals who no longer live in the UK’ in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-eu-and-efta-citizens-visiting-the-uk">Healthcare for visitors to the UK from the EU</a>).</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
