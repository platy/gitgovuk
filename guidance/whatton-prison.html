<h2>Book and plan your visit to Whatton</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>HMP Whatton is offering visits for family and friends. Visiting times and availability may change at short notice. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact the prison direct for any queries</a>.</p>

<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Whatton you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-whatton">required <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr></a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>You can book at least 7 days in advance and at least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit.</p>

<p>There may be a limit to the number of visits a person can have. You can check this with Whatton.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Whatton</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

<h3>Help with the cost of your visit</h3>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Entering Whatton</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  Read the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">acceptable forms of <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors (including children) will be given a pat-down search. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Whatton has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>Each adult visitor is allowed to take in a maximum of £25 in notes or coins.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Whatton. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://rushcliffecvs.org.uk/projects-projects-72/whatton-prison-visitor-centre-projects-78.html" rel="external">visitor centre</a> run by a community service.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit. The children’s play area is currently not available to use.</p>

<p>Wheelchairs are available in the prison and there is wheelchair access to both the visitor centre and the prison.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>Family visits are offered in addition to the normal visit allowances. They are held at least 3 times a year during key school holidays. Only visitors on the prisoners approved list can attend.</p>

<p>All fathers (regardless of their visit allowance status) can apply to take part, but recent behaviour is considered in the application process.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Whatton</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Whatton.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family whenever they are out of their cell. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Whatton using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at Whatton.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.
Include the person’s name and prison number on the envelope. 
If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Whatton</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Men in Whatton are given a list of approved items that they can buy.
No parcels or gifts are accepted.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners can bring books for prisoners when they visit. You can also send books directly to loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
