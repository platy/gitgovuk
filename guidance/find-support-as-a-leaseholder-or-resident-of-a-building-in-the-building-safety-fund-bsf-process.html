<h2>Understanding the BSF process:</h2>

<p>For information on the BSF process, read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-a-step-by-step-guide-for-leaseholders-and-residents">Step-by-Step guide</a>.</p>

<p>To help you understand some of the words and terms used in the Service, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-leaseholder-and-resident-service-glossary">glossary</a>.</p>

<h2>Building Safety Fund (BSF) Leaseholder and Resident Service:</h2>

<p>This Service gives you access to online information on your building’s status in the BSF application process. It’s one of the practical steps we’re taking to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve transparency: updated information will be published on the Service on the third week of every month so you can track the progress of your building’s BSF application.</li>
  <li>provide reassurance: leaseholders will not be liable for the cost of removal and replacement of dangerous cladding.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.building-safety-fund-status.communities.gov.uk" rel="external">Access the Service</a></p>
</div>

<p>Type in the <strong>unique building code</strong> exactly as it is written. This is available from your responsible entity.  If you live in social sector housing, your responsible entity is your local authority or housing association.  If you live in private sector housing, examples of responsible entities include a building’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>freeholder</li>
  <li>head leaseholder</li>
  <li>private sector building owner or their agent</li>
  <li>right-to-manage company</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have not received the unique building code by mid-February 2022 or are experiencing issues accessing the Service, contact your responsible entity first.</p>

<p>For information on the BSF process, read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-a-step-by-step-guide-for-leaseholders-and-residents">Step-by-Step guide</a>.</p>

<p>To help you understand some of the words and terms used in the Service, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-leaseholder-and-resident-service-glossary">glossary</a>.</p>

<p>While we have made reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of the data in this service, it should be used as a guide on where a building is in the BSF process.  We expect responsible entities to keep leaseholders and residents updated so please contact them for real-time or more detailed information.</p>

<p>If you need to report a fault with the Service, contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:BSF@levellingup.gov.uk">BSF@levellingup.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>To provide feedback on the Service, please complete this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/r/4E4rXtPxUU" rel="external">feedback form</a>.</p>

<h2>Engaging with your responsible entity</h2>

<p>We expect your responsible entity, or their authorised agent, to inform you of the nature of the works they intend to carry out on your building where an application has been made to the BSF.  They need to provide you with regular updates at the following key stages in the process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registration phase</li>
  <li>project procurement</li>
  <li>application submitted</li>
  <li>outcome of application</li>
  <li>commencement of works (with an estimated completion date)</li>
  <li>works completed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a leaseholder, you can access free initial specialist advice to help understand your rights through the Leasehold Advisory Service (LEASE).  More information on LEASE, including how to contact them for advice, can be found on their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lease-advice.org/" rel="external">website</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>The Leaseholder and Resident Service allows you to directly access online information about the status of your building’s application in the BSF process.</p>

<p>If you have not received your unique building code to access the Leaseholder and Resident Service, please contact your responsible entity who will be able to provide you with the code. You can use the following <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lease-advice.org/files/2022/01/16.-Letter-Requesting-Information-About-The-Building-Safety-Fund-BSF-Leaseholder-And-Resident-Service-%E2%80%9Cthe-Service%E2%80%9D-And-Details-Of-The-Building-Code.docx" rel="external">MS Word letter template</a> to contact your responsible entity</p>
</div>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p>Buildings with unsafe cladding must be remediated as quickly as possible to ensure that residents are safe in their homes.  Where <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-leaseholder-and-resident-service-glossary#responsible-entity">responsible entities</a> are failing to make acceptable progress, further action will be taken.
Local authorities and fire and rescue services can use their enforcement powers against buildings with unsafe cladding systems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/contents" rel="external">Housing Act 2004</a>, local authorities have a duty to keep housing conditions in their area under review. They may inspect housing to assess the seriousness of certain hazards and may take enforcement action against responsible entities, based on their assessment.</li>
  <li>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" rel="external">Fire Safety Order 2005</a>, fire and rescue services can use their enforcement powers to address fire safety risks from unsafe cladding, which the Fire Safety Act 2021 will put beyond doubt.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the support of the Joint Inspection Team, created by DLUHC, enforcement action is being taken against buildings with unsafe cladding.  The latest updates are published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics?parent=%2Fhousing-local-and-community%2Fbuilding-regulation&amp;topic=91486f5f-37b0-401a-8e16-22be5dd1a6e9">Building Safety Programme’s monthly data release</a>.</p>

<h2>Do I have to pay for the remediation works on my building (over 18m)?</h2>

<p>Leaseholders and residents should not pay for works that qualify for funding from the Private Sector Cladding Remediation Fund (ACM cladding) or Building Safety Fund (non-ACM cladding).</p>

<p>There is one exception: if the leaseholder is an economic actor (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-leaseholder-and-resident-service-glossary#economic-actor">glossary</a> for a definition of economic actor). Responsible entities will send leaseholders a subsidy declaration form as part of the BSF process so that they can confirm if they are an economic actor.  If you’re not, you don’t need to complete the form.  Economic actors can refer to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/989381/Subsidy_Control_Guidance_for_Leaseholders.pdf" rel="external">guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The above only relates to eligible works that address fire safety risks. If building remediation works fall outside the above-mentioned Funds, the building’s responsible entity could claim costs back from leaseholders through the service charge (where permitted through the lease agreement).</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>If you don’t know what to do with the unique building code you received to access the Leaseholder and Resident Service or you think the code is wrong</h3>

<p>Please contact your responsible entity.  They can confirm if they have applied to the BSF and provide you with the correct code.</p>

<p>The Service does not replace regular engagement between leaseholders/residents and their responsible entities who we expect to keep you informed throughout the BSF process (see our step-by-step guide).</p>

<h3>If you want your letter with the unique building code to be sent to a different address</h3>

<p>This letter can only be sent to addresses in buildings that have applied for funding for data protection reasons.</p>

<p>If you are a leaseholder who doesn’t live in your property, please ask your property’s occupant(s) or your agent to forward the relevant letter to you.</p>

<h3>If you have accessed the Leaseholder and Resident Service and have questions about the information provided</h3>
<p>The information on the Service is updated monthly with changes published on the third week of every month.  If changes are recent, they may not appear. For this reason, the information on the Service can be used as a guide rather than a real-time update.</p>

<p>You should contact your responsible entity to get real-time or more detailed information.</p>

<p>If you believe the status update information on the Service is wrong, please contact us as <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:BSF@levellingup.gov.uk">BSF@levellingup.gov.uk</a> and we will investigate.</p>

<h3>If you’ve contacted your responsible entity but they haven’t given you the unique building code to access the Leaseholder and Resident Service.</h3>

<p>The code was given to your responsible entity when they first registered for the BSF and confirmed again this January when we emailed them advising of the opening of the Leaseholder and Resident Service.</p>

<p>If you have already contacted your responsible entity, please allow five working days for a response.  If, after this time, you have not received the code, email us again at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:bsf@levellingup.gov.uk">bsf@levellingup.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>For data protection reasons, we cannot email you the code or send it to another address other than to the building address registered under the BSF.  Therefore, when you email us, provide your full name and the correct building address and we will send you a letter with the code.</p>
