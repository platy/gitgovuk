<h2>Understanding the <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr> process:</h2>

<p>For information on the <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr> process, read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-a-step-by-step-guide-for-leaseholders-and-residents">Step-by-Step guide</a>.</p>

<p>To help you understand some of the words and terms used, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-leaseholder-and-resident-service-glossary">glossary</a>.</p>

<h2>Building Safety Fund (<abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr>) Leaseholder and Resident Service:</h2>

<p>This Service gives you access to online information on your building’s status in the <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr> application process. It’s one of the practical steps we’re taking to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve transparency: updated information is published on the Service every month so you can track the progress of your building’s <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr> application. The updated data is publicised on the front page of the Service</li>
  <li>provide reassurance: qualifying leaseholders (those living in their own homes, or with up to 3 UK properties in total) will be protected, in full, from the costs associated with the remediation of unsafe cladding.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.building-safety-fund-status.communities.gov.uk" rel="external">Access the Service</a></p>
</div>

<p>Type in the <strong>unique building code</strong> exactly as it is written. This is available from your responsible entity. If you live in social sector housing, your responsible entity is your local authority or housing association. If you live in private sector housing, examples of responsible entities include a building’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>freeholder</li>
  <li>head leaseholder</li>
  <li>right-to-manage company (RTM) or</li>
  <li>resident management company (RMC)</li>
</ul>

<p>A responsible entity can authorise a managing agent to act on their behalf: apply to the <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr> and manage the <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr> application on a day-to-day basis. However, they only act on behalf of the responsible entity who retains the legal right to carry out works to address fire risks caused by unsafe cladding.</p>

<p>If you have not received the unique building code contact your responsible entity first. You can use the following <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lease-advice.org/files/2022/01/16.-Letter-Requesting-Information-About-The-Building-Safety-Fund-BSF-Leaseholder-And-Resident-Service-%E2%80%9Cthe-Service%E2%80%9D-And-Details-Of-The-Building-Code.docx" rel="external">MS Word letter template</a> to contact them.</p>

<p>If they are unresponsive, email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:BSF@levellingup.gov.uk"><abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr>@levellingup.gov.uk</a>, providing your full name and address (which must be the same as the building in the <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr>). We will post the code to you and request that you do not share this with third parties living outside your building.</p>

<p>While we have made reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of the data in this service, it should be used as a guide on where a building is in the <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr> process. We expect responsible entities to keep leaseholders and residents regularly updated so contact them for real-time or more detailed information.</p>

<p>If you need to report a fault with the Service, contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:BSF@levellingup.gov.uk"><abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr>@levellingup.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>To provide feedback on the Service, please complete this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/r/4E4rXtPxUU" rel="external">feedback form</a>.</p>

<h2>Engaging with your responsible entity</h2>

<p>We expect your responsible entity, or their authorised agent, to inform you of the nature of the works they intend to carry out on your building where an application has been made to the <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr>. They need to provide you with regular updates at the following key stages in the process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registration phase</li>
  <li>project procurement</li>
  <li>application submitted</li>
  <li>outcome of application</li>
  <li>commencement of works (with an estimated completion date)</li>
  <li>works completed.</li>
</ul>

<p>On 28 June 2022, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/leaseholders-protected-from-unfair-cladding-costs-as-governments-building-safety-reforms-come-into-force">leaseholder protections came into force</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a leaseholder, you can access free initial specialist advice to help understand your rights through the Leasehold Advisory Service (LEASE). More information on LEASE, including how to contact them for advice, can be found on their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lease-advice.org/" rel="external">website</a>.</p>

<h2>Do I have to pay for the remediation works on my building (over 18 metres)?</h2>

<p>From Tuesday 28 June 2022, the leaseholder protections in the Building Safety Act 2022 came into force.</p>

<p>Qualifying leaseholders will pay nothing to remove dangerous cladding, and the amount they can be asked to contribute to fixing other historical building safety defects is firmly capped.</p>

<p>Before qualifying leaseholders are asked to contribute to these costs, landlords must provide a formal legal certificate, or demonstrate that the costs do not relate to works covered by the Act.</p>

<p>We are also implementing a series of schemes to protect non-qualifying leaseholders from remediation costs, if remediation is needed.</p>

<p>For <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-act-2022-leaseholder-protections-what-to-do">more information, visit this page</a>.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/leaseholder-protections-letter-to-building-owners">written to freeholders</a> and made clear that the days of leaseholders being faced with large invoices for building safety repairs are now over.</p>

<p>The above letter reminds freeholders that qualifying leaseholders now have protections in law from costs and that they will be acting illegally if they attempt to circumvent them.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Secretary of State confirms that anyone who chooses to breach statutory protections will be committing a criminal offence. Individuals involved in such criminal activity could face up to 10 years in prison, in addition to the consequences for their companies. Criminal exploitation of leaseholders will be treated as a matter of the utmost seriousness.</p>

<p>With the support of the Joint Inspection Team, created by Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, enforcement action is being taken against those who fail to progress fire safety works for buildings that qualify for the <abbr title="Building Safety Fund">BSF</abbr>.</p>
