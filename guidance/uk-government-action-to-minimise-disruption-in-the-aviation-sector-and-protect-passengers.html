<h2>Why there’s disruption in the aviation sector</h2>

<p>The majority of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> flights continue to be on time and without disruption. However, some passengers have faced disruption, which has also occurred in the aviation sector across Europe and globally, and has been caused by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pent-up demand since the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">lifting of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions for travel across Europe and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a> – many passengers are travelling abroad for the first time in 2 years</li>
  <li>staff shortages after many workers changed jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
  <li>the time it takes to complete essential background checks and training before an employee can start work airside.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ensure industry deliver a realistic summer schedule</h2>

<p>1) We and the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> have set out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/aviation-resilience-planning">5 specific expectations</a> to the industry to deliver a successful summer operation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>summer schedules must be reviewed to make sure they are deliverable</li>
  <li>everyone from ground handlers to air traffic control must collaborate on resilience planning</li>
  <li>passengers must be promptly informed of their consumer rights when things go wrong and – if necessary – compensation in good time</li>
  <li>disabled and less mobile passengers must be given assistance they require</li>
  <li>safety and security must never be compromised</li>
</ul>

<p>2) We have introduced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-helps-prevent-last-minute-summer-flight-cancellations-with-amnesty-on-airport-slots-rule">new regulations on airport slots</a> that give airlines the tools to ensure that airline schedules are manageable and reduce flight disruption over the summer peak.</p>

<p>3) We have strengthened industry-government working, by establishing a new weekly Strategic Risk Group, chaired by ministers and attended by airline, airport and ground handler <abbr title="chief executive officers">CEOs</abbr> to ensure they are prepared for summer and can meet the schedules.</p>

<p>4) We have established a weekly Summer Resilience Group with airline, airport and ground handler operational directors to help them work through their pinch-points in the aviation system as they emerge and work collaboratively on solutions.</p>

<p>5) We have established a joint Home Office and <abbr title="department for Transport">DfT</abbr> Ministerial Border Group to identify and prepare for high levels of demand at the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border.</p>

<p>6) We have worked with the major airlines and airports to get weekly updates and assurances to government that they can run their schedule of summer flights.</p>

<p>7) We are working with international partners, neighbouring countries and <abbr title="European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation">EUROCONTROL</abbr>, to ensure that disruption is minimised through coordinated planning and cooperation across airspace boundaries.</p>

<p>8) We are undertaking a review of the ground handling market to seek out opportunities to improve quality and consistency of service.</p>

<h2>Supporting passengers</h2>

<p>9) We will launch a new Aviation Passenger Charter, a one-stop guide for passengers informing them of their rights, responsibilities and what they can reasonably expect of the aviation industry when flying.</p>

<p>10) We have worked with the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> and industry to publish and promote guidance for passengers as part of a joint campaign of activity to communicate things they need to know and do when travelling by air this summer, helping to speed up processing time and reduce queues and delays.</p>

<p>11) We have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/aviation-resilience-planning">written to airlines</a> to remind them of their legal responsibilities in providing information, care and assistance, refunds, and compensation.</p>

<p>12) We are working with the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> reviewing airlines current practices to ensure legal responsibilities in providing information, care and assistance, refunds, and compensation are being met and encouraging best practice.</p>

<p>13) We intend on strengthening consumer protection for air passengers such as additional enforcement powers for <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr>, our proposals are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-aviation-consumer-policy-protecting-air-passenger-rights">aviation consumer consultation</a>.</p>

<p>14) The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.caa.co.uk/media/cb4mqahj/june-2022-prm-letter.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> has written to airports</a> to set out their plans for additional measures to improve provision of assistance to disabled and less mobile passengers and support the sector by providing guidance.</p>

<h2>Supporting industry to recruit, retain and train staff</h2>

<p>15) We changed the law so industry has more flexibility to train staff and allow them to deploy staff quickly and flexibly while maintaining security standards.</p>

<p>16) We are launching a Generation Aviation campaign, working with industry to promote awareness of aviation careers and increase the number of people applying for jobs in the sector.</p>

<p>17)  We are working with the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> to launch a £700,000 skills funding competition this autumn to support outreach across the sector and raise awareness of aviation careers to young people.</p>

<p>18) We have launched the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://trs-system.co.uk/aviation" rel="external">Aviation Skills Recruitment Platform</a> to support skills retention and recruitment in the sector.</p>

<p>19)  We are building partnerships with colleges and universities to ensure students are attracted to and prepared for a career in aviation – and to support this we have launched the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://talentview.org/aviation" rel="external">Talentview Aviation platform</a> to connect students to aviation sector employers.</p>

<p>20) We are working with the Department for Work and Pensions to promote aviation roles and recruitment via job centres and training for jobs coaches.</p>

<p>21) We are delivering our Reach for the Sky outreach programme, supported by our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/aviation-ambassadors-group">Aviation Ambassadors</a> to promote diversity, inclusion and accessibility in the sector.</p>

<p>22) We introduced the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/applying-for-covid-19-airport-and-ground-operations-funding">Airport and Ground Operations Support Scheme (<abbr title="Airport and Ground Operations Support Scheme">AGOSS</abbr>)</a> to support commercial airports and ground operators with fixed costs, through £161 million in grants.</p>
