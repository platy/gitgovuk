<p>This applies to you if you’re based in England, Scotland or Wales and use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vans or other light goods vehicles (sometimes called ‘light commercial vehicles’)</li>
  <li>vans towing trailers</li>
  <li>cars towing trailers</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for a standard international goods vehicle operator licence for the first time</li>
  <li>add the vehicles to your standard international goods vehicle operator licence (if you already have one)</li>
  <li>apply to upgrade your standard national goods vehicle operator licence (if you have one) to a standard international goods vehicle operator licence</li>
  <li>apply to upgrade your restricted goods vehicle operator licence (if you have one) to a standard international goods vehicle operator licence</li>

<p>You can be fined by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) if you operate without the right licence. You can also be prosecuted in the European countries you drive through.</p>

<h2>Check if the rules apply to you</h2>

<p>The rules apply to you if you use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vans with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-weights-explained">maximum authorised mass</a> (<abbr title="maximum authorised mass">MAM</abbr>) over 2,500kg (2.5 tonnes) and up to and including 3,500kg (3.5 tonnes)</li>

</li>
</ol>

<h3>Get a transport manager</h3>

<p>You must have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/become-transport-manager">transport manager</a> to get a standard international goods vehicle operator licence. This is someone responsible for things such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>planning routes and scheduling delivery times</li>
  <li>managing your team of drivers and administration staff</li>
  <li>making sure drivers follow company and industry regulations</li>
  <li>arranging vehicle maintenance, MOTs and tax payments</li>
  <li>organising vehicle replacements</li>
</ul>

<p>You must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply to get an existing member of staff (including yourself) temporarily recognised as a transport manager</li>
  <li>employ someone with a Transport Manager Certificate of Professional Competence (<abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>) qualification</li>
  <li>hire in an external qualified transport manager</li>
</ul>

<h4>Option 1: get an existing member of staff temporarily recognised as a transport manager</h4>

<p>If you decide to get an existing member of staff temporarily recognised as a transport manager, they must have at least 10 years of experience managing fleets of vans or other light goods vehicles before 20 August 2020.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The member of staff needs to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-temporary-transport-manager">apply to be temporarily recognised as a transport manager</a> (this is sometimes called having ‘acquired rights’). If their application is successful, they’ll be treated as having the Transport Manager CPC qualification until 21 May 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you apply for your goods vehicle operator licence, you need to apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/become-transport-manager/getting-added-to-an-operators-licence">add them as the transport manager for your licence</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The member of staff needs to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/become-transport-manager">pass the CPC qualification</a> by 21 May 2025 to continue being a transport manager after that date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they’ve fully qualified, they’ll need to keep up a high-quality professional knowledge of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/become-transport-manager/getting-added-to-an-operators-licence#keeping-your-knowledge-up-to-date">transport industry rules and policies</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Option 2: employ someone with a transport manager qualification</h4>

<p>You can employ someone with a Transport Manager <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> qualification if you do not already have one.</p>

<p>You need to make sure they keep up a high-quality professional knowledge of transport industry rules and policies.</p>

<h4>Option 3: hire in an external transport manager</h4>

<p>You can ‘hire in’ an external transport manager. They’re not someone on your payroll, but they have a contract with you to act as your transport manager.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a contract with them that sets out the tasks they’ll perform as your transport manager</li>
  <li>make sure they only work for a maximum of 4 vehicle operators (including you), managing no more than 50 vehicles in total across all the operators</li>
</ul>

<h3>Apply for a standard international goods vehicle operator licence</h3>

<p>You need a standard international goods vehicle operator licence to use your vans or car and trailers to transport goods for hire or reward in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.</p>

<h4>Changes to your ‘financial standing’</h4>

<p>By law, you need to prove that you have access to a set amount of finance to run your business (called ‘financial standing’). The amount you need depends on how many vehicles you have.</p>

  <li>£4,500 per additional <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> in your fleet</li>
  <li>£800 per additional van or car and trailer in your fleet</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes to your transport manager’s responsibilities</h4>

<p>Your transport manager will become legally responsible for all the vehicles on your operator licence, in addition to the <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> and trailers already on it.</p>

<h2>If you already have a standard national goods vehicle operator licence</h2>
