<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This page explains what you need to do to carry out international road haulage from 21 May 2022 if you use vans and car and trailers.</p>

<p>It will be updated when more details are available.</p>

<p><a href="https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKDVSA/subscriber/new?topic_id=UKDVSA_V_21" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Sign up for email alerts when this page changes</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>From 21 May 2022, you’ll need a standard international goods vehicle operator licence to transport goods in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.</p>

<p>This will apply to you if you’re based in Great Britain or Northern Ireland and use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vans or other light goods vehicles (sometimes called ‘light commercial vehicles’)</li>
  <li>vans towing trailers</li>
  <li>cars towing trailers</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add the vehicles to your goods vehicle operator licence (if you already have one)</li>
  <li>get a goods vehicle operator licence for the first time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check if the new rules apply to you</h2>

<p>The new rules will apply to you if you use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vans with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-weights-explained">maximum authorised mass</a> (<abbr title="maximum authorised mass">MAM</abbr>) over 2,500kg (2.5 tonnes) and up to and including 3,500kg (3.5 tonnes)</li>
  <li>vans towing a trailer with a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-weights-explained" class="govuk-link">gross train weight</a> (<abbr title="gross train weight">GTW</abbr>) over 2.5 tonnes and up to and including 3.5 tonnes</li>
  <li>cars towing a trailer with a <abbr title="gross train weight">GTW</abbr> over 2.5 tonnes and up to and including 3.5 tonnes</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not need a goods vehicle operator licence if any of these apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you only use your vehicles in the UK</li>
  <li>you are transporting goods on a non-commercial basis (not for ‘hire or reward’)</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-legal-adviser">Get legal advice</a> if you’re not sure if the rules will apply to you.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you already have a goods vehicle operator licence</h2>

<p>You’ll need to add your vans and car and trailers to your existing goods vehicle operator licence to transport goods in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. You will not need to assign them to an operating centre.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>You’ll be able to add your vehicles to your operator licence later - you cannot do it yet. <a href="https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKDVSA/subscriber/new?topic_id=UKDVSA_V_21" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Sign up for email alerts</a> to be told when you can add them.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>The Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain or the Transport Regulation Unit in Northern Ireland will be able to take action against you if you do not add the vehicles to your licence.</p>
</div>

<h3>How much it costs</h3>

<p>There’s no fee to add the vehicles to your licence if you have not reached your vehicle limit.</p>

<p>However, you will need to pay £257 to make a ‘major variation’ if you need to increase the vehicle limit on your licence.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>There are different <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/goods-vehicle-operator-licensing-licence-applications" class="govuk-link" rel="external">goods vehicle operator licensing fees in Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Changes to your ‘financial standing’</h3>

<p>By law, you need to prove that you have access to a set amount of finance to run your business (called ‘financial standing’). The amount you need depends on how many vehicles you have.</p>

<p>You must have £8,000 available for the first vehicle in your fleet. You need an extra:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£4,450 per additional <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> in your fleet</li>
  <li>£800 per additional van or car and trailer in your fleet</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes to your transport manager’s responsibilities</h3>

<p>Your transport manager will become legally responsible for all the vehicles on your operator licence, in addition to the <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> and trailers already on it.</p>

<h2>If you do not have a goods vehicle operator licence</h2>

<p>You’ll need to get a goods vehicle operator licence to continue using your vans or car and trailers to transport goods in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.</p>

<p>You’ll need to apply for a standard international licence - this lets you transport your own and other people’s goods.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can apply for an operator licence later - you cannot do it yet. <a rel="external" href="https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKDVSA/subscriber/new?topic_id=UKDVSA_V_21" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts</a> to be told when you can apply.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Warning" role="note" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>The Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain or the Transport Regulation Unit in Northern Ireland will be able to take action against you if you do not get a licence.</p>
</div>

<h3>How much it costs</h3>

<p>It costs £257 to apply for a goods vehicle operator licence.</p>

<p>If your application is successful, you need to pay £401 for the licence.</p>

<p>You’ll then need to pay a continuation fee every 5 years to keep your licence active. This costs £401.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">

</div>

<h4>Finance that you must have available</h4>

<p>By law, you need to prove that you have access to a set amount of finance to run your business. The amount you need depends on how many vehicles you have.</p>

<p>You must have £1,600 available for the first vehicle in your fleet. You need an extra £800 per additional vehicle in your fleet.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong> 
You have a fleet of 5 vans.</p>

<p>You need to have £1,600 for the first van.</p>

<p>You then need £800 each for the remaining 4 vans (£800 × 4 = £3,200).</p>

<p>You need to prove you have access to funds of at least £4,800 (£1,600 + £3,200).</p>
</div>

<h3>Getting a transport manager</h3>

<p>You’ll need to have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/become-transport-manager" class="govuk-link">transport manager</a>. This is someone responsible for things such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>planning routes and scheduling delivery times</li>
  <li>managing your team of drivers and administration staff</li>
  <li>making sure drivers follow company and industry regulations</li>
  <li>arranging vehicle maintenance, MOTs and tax payments</li>
  <li>organising vehicle replacements</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be able to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use an existing member of staff (including yourself) who is not qualified as a transport manager, but has managed fleets of vehicles for at least 10 years before 20 August 2020</li>
  <li>employ someone with a transport manager qualification (called a Transport Manager Certificate of Professional Competence - or ‘<abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>’)</li>
  <li>hire in an external qualified transport manager</li>
</ul>

<h4>Option 1: use someone who does not have a Transport Manager <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>
</h4>

<p>If you decide to use someone who does not have a Transport Manager <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr>, they need to have at least 10 years of experience managing fleets of vehicles before 20 August 2020.</p>

<p>They need to apply to have their experience recognised so they can become a temporary transport manager (sometimes called having ‘acquired rights’). This means they’ll be treated as having the Transport Manager <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> for a period of time.</p>

<p>The deadline for applying is 21 May 2024. It’s free to apply.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-temporary-transport-manager" class="govuk-link">Apply to be a temporary transport manager</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If their application is successful, they’ll be recognised as a transport manager until 21 May 2025. They’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/become-transport-manager">pass the <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> qualification</a> by that date to continue as a transport manager.</p>

<p>After they’ve qualified, they’ll need to keep up a high-quality professional knowledge of transport industry rules and policies. They can take transport manager refresher courses to help them do this.</p>

<h4>Option 2: employ someone with a transport manager qualification</h4>

<p>You can employ someone with a Transport Manager <abbr title="Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> qualification.</p>

<p>You need to make sure they keep up a high-quality professional knowledge of transport industry rules and policies.</p>

<h4>Option 3: hire in an external transport manager</h4>

<p>You can ‘hire in’ an external transport manager. They’re not someone on your payroll, but they have a contract with you to act as your transport manager.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a contract with them that sets out the tasks they’ll perform as your transport manager</li>
  <li>make sure they only work for a maximum of 4 vehicle operators (including you), managing no more than 50 vehicles in total across all the operators</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documents your drivers will need to carry</h2>

<p>Your drivers will need to carry a certified copy of your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-licence-for-the-community-for-international-road-haulage" class="govuk-link">UK Licence for the Community</a> during international journeys.</p>

<p>If you’re applying for a vehicle operator licence for the first time, you’ll get a UK Licence for the Community as part of your application for a standard international operator licence. There’s no extra fee for them.</p>
