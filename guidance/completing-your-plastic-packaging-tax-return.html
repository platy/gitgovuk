<ul>
  <li>1 April to 30 June</li>
  <li>1 July to 30 September</li>
  <li>1 October to 31 December</li>

<p>You must submit the return and pay any tax due no later than the last working day of the month following the end of the accounting period being reported.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

  <li>reused for the presentation of goods</li>

</ul>

<h3>The total weight of finished plastic packaging components not subject to the tax in the accounting period</h3>

<h3>The total value of taxed plastic packaging components for which a credit is being claimed in the accounting period</h3>

<p>This must be given in pounds sterling (£).</p>

<p>Credits will be for packaging components where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tax has been paid in a previous accounting period and has subsequently been exported or has been converted into a different plastic packaging component</li>
  <li>they have been manufactured or imported in the same accounting period as being exported by someone else, or converted into a different plastic packaging component</li>
</ul>

<p>The time limit for claiming a tax credit is 2 years from the manufacture or import of the plastic packaging component.</p>

  <li>any tax credits claimed for the accounting period</li>
</ul>

<h3>The tax due for this period</h3>

<p>This must be given in pounds sterling (£).</p>

<p>It will be calculated automatically using the values you have given.</p>

<h3>A declaration that the information is true and correct</h3>

<p>You must declare that all of the information you’ve provided is true and correct to the best of your knowledge.</p>

<h2>Submitting returns and payments for a group of companies</h2>

<p>If you’ve been appointed as the group’s representative member, at the end of each accounting period, you should submit a single return and payment on behalf of all members of the group.</p>

<p>The figures included on the return should be the total for all the members of the group, for each item. You should make sure each member keeps records to support the figures you use.</p>

<h2>Correcting an error in a previous tax return</h2>

<p>If you submit a return that includes incorrect information, you should correct it as soon as possible and within 4 years from the due date of the tax return which needs correcting.</p>

<p>More information about how to correct an error will be provided once available.</p>

<h2>If you do not submit your tax return or pay in time</h2>

<p>You may be charged penalties if you do not submit your return or pay the tax in time.</p>

<p>You’ll also be charged interest on late payments. Late payment interest is calculated on the outstanding tax from the date the amount became due, and payable to the date the amount is actually paid.</p>
