<p>By providing data to help build a picture of the environment in which we are operating, sensors are essential to both military capability and security operations. They’re used everywhere from space to underwater, and help ensure the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has an information advantage.</p>

<p>Sensor technology underpins all areas of <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>’s work, from supporting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, to enhancing platform survivability and targeting and advanced weapon operations.</p>

<p>Our remit ranges from carrying out underpinning and novel research, such as the work of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://udrc.eng.ed.ac.uk/" rel="external">University Defence Research Collaboration in Signal Processing</a>, to providing operational support, such as helping law enforcement to find small digital media (like <abbr title="secure digital">SD</abbr> cards) during searches of property. And work with our partners on high profile projects developing the latest technology, such as the future combat aircraft (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/what-we-do/team-tempest/" rel="external">Team Tempest</a>).</p>

<p>Our challenges include ensuring we can operate in high-threat environments, as well as the increasingly congested electromagnetic spectrum, and making sure we’re exploiting the latest advances such as autonomy and quantum technology.</p>

<h2>World-leading innovations in sensing</h2>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> and our strategic partners in academia and industry are at the cutting edge of novel sensing technology, working alongside military and security professionals.</p>

<p>Our developments range from enhanced infra-red cameras that use processing to keep track of dozens of potential points of interest, to a radio system that can potentially force an adversary radio network to reconfigure itself.</p>
<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Uncrewed aerial vehicle and tank" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/146810/UAV_and_Tank_HEIMDALL_960x640.png"></div>
<figcaption><p>Uncrewed aerial vehicle and tank imaged using HEIMDALL.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>For example we have worked with Cubica Technology to use commercial, off-the-shelf imagers as the basis to develop HEIMDALL, an electro-optic camera that can detect very small uncrewed aircraft systems (<abbr title="uncrewed aircraft systems">UAS</abbr>). It can be challenging to detect <abbr title="uncrewed aircraft systems">UAS</abbr> in complex urban environments and we trialled integration of HEIMDALL with other counter-<abbr title="uncrewed aircraft systems">UAS</abbr> technologies (through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sapient-autonomous-sensor-system"><abbr title="Sensing for Asset Protection with Integrated Electronic Networked Technology">SAPIENT</abbr></a> network) at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-hosts-international-military-urban-exercise">Contested Urban Environment 2021 (<abbr title="Contested Urban Environment 2021">CUE2021</abbr>) exercise</a>.</p>

<p>We have also developed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351913672_Robust_real-time_3D_imaging_of_moving_scenes_through_atmospheric_obscurant_using_single-photon_LiDAR" rel="external">single photon sensors that would provide imaging in challenging scenarios</a>, such as the presence of thick smoke or over distances of many kilometres. Along with Heriot-Watt University, <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> has carried out trials using single photon counting light detection and ranging (<abbr title="light detection and ranging">LiDAR</abbr>) to obtain video-rate <abbr title="3-dimensional">3D</abbr> imagery. This technology could have a wide range of applications including long-range target identification in the air, on land and at sea.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Armed figure in the snow" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/146777/Looking_through_snow_storms.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Similarly, we’ve been working with the Swedish Defence Research agency <abbr title="Totalförsvarets forskningsinstitut, Swedish Defence Research Agency">FOI</abbr> to test innovative technologies that will increase the performance of electro-optic sensors in the presence of obscurants like bad weather. Progress has been made by developing and testing new sensors, new models and new lasers to act like torches through snowstorms and clouds.</p>

<p>Some of our work is more speculative. In collaboration with international partners, we are researching the idea of a cognitive radar system. It could use machine learning to ‘think’ for itself and adapt modes according to changes in the environment or in the behaviour of an adversary. And we’re working with eminent mathematicians at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/" rel="external">The Isaac Newton Institute</a> to push the fundamental limits of sensing applications – like radar imaging through walls.</p>

<p>We regularly register new intellectual property (<abbr title="intellectual property">IP</abbr>) submissions and obtain patents for our unique ideas. Our innovations in electro-optics led to the founding of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sentinelphotonics.co.uk/" rel="external">Sentinel Photonics</a>, a spin-out company that was awarded funding from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Government to provide <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/photonics-spin-out-to-defend-against-battlefield-laser-threats-awarded-funding">novel laser detection and protection products</a> for the military.</p>

<h2>Data fusion through open-working and collaboration</h2>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> has a leading role in multi-national collaboration initiatives to enable data fusion. The ability to integrate multiple data sources helps our armed forces get an even better picture of their position (enhanced situational awareness) more quickly and efficiently. It also improves our ability to share sensing information with our allies.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="People in a room full of computers" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/146702/SAPIENT_at_NATO_TIE21.png"></div>
<figcaption><p>NATO technical interoperability exercise (TIE21)</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>We have developed Sensing for Asset Protection with Integrated Electronic Networked Technology (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sapient-autonomous-sensor-system"><abbr title="Sensing for Asset Protection with Integrated Electronic Networked Technology">SAPIENT</abbr></a>), which uses autonomy to reduce the workload of people operating multi-sensor systems. It specifies standards and protocols that allow modern AI algorithms to work in concert across a suite of sensors. <abbr title="Sensing for Asset Protection with Integrated Electronic Networked Technology">SAPIENT</abbr> has been adopted by the Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>) as the standard for counter-<abbr title="uncrewed aircraft systems">UAS</abbr> (uncrewed air system) technology. It is also being evaluated as a potential <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> standard for counter-drone systems, including recent testing at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://web.cvent.com/event/005a833b-f529-4c47-b1fc-b0d8f55b95e9/summary" rel="external"><abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> technical interoperability exercise (TIE21)</a> in The Netherlands.</p>

<p>Another example is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dstl-shares-new-open-source-framework-initiative">Stone Soup</a>, an open-source software framework designed by <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> and Defence Research and Development Canada and adopted internationally to help improve tracking technology.</p>

<h2>Quantum sensing technology</h2>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>, supported by funding from <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>, is developing and funding novel quantum sensing technologies, which have the potential to be more cost-effective, portable, sensitive and efficient than traditional sensors. Sensing technology that used to need a whole roomful of equipment now fits in a shoe box; for example we are developing quantum gravity sensors that are small and light enough to be installed in a drone.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Hands holding technology including small electronics" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/146703/D2124_Quantum_Lab_Stock_Photography_O_50_960x640.png"></div>
<figcaption><p>Inside Dstl’s Quantum Lab</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>We recently generated laser-cooled rubidium atoms for the first time, a key enabling tool for a variety of sensing and timing applications, such as novel underground sensing and gravity map matching. Working jointly with the University of Birmingham and industry partners, we used this innovation to develop a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04315-3" rel="external">quantum gravity gradiometer</a> that achieved a world-first in detecting an underground tunnel outside.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> also funded the National Physical Laboratory to develop a miniature atomic clock (<abbr title="miniature atomic clock">MINAC</abbr>), which is now being commercialised by the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) Wave 2 Pioneer atomic clock project KAIROS, led by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.teledyne-e2v.com/en/solutions/quantum-timing-gravity/timing/" rel="external">Teledyne-e2v</a>. This portable device will bring accurate timing to many new applications, potentially even being used as an alternative to the conventional Global Navigation Satellite System (<abbr title="Global Navigation Satellite System">GNSS</abbr>). It’s part of our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-explore-new-ways-of-delivering-sat-nav-for-the-uk">cross-government work to explore new ways of delivering satellite navigation</a> (sat nav) and protect access to <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>, including making receivers more resilient.</p>

<p>We encourage and support the growth of quantum sensing capability within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. As part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://quantumsensors.org/" rel="external"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Quantum Technology Sensors and Timing Hub</a>, we collaborate closely with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uknqt.ukri.org/" rel="external">National Quantum Technologies Programme</a>, a partnership supporting national expertise in this cutting edge technology. This includes funding a large number of PhDs with <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> institutions.</p>

<p>Other areas of quantum sensing work include magnetometry, quantum illumination and radio frequency sensing.</p>
