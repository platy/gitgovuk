<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Bulgaria to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver rules </a>.</p>

<p>Bulgaria isn’t in the Schengen area. It applies a <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-permit">separate 90-day limit</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>Bulgaria’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvr.bg/migration" rel="external">Bulgaria’s government</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy in the UK</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Bulgaria. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Bulgaria’s embassy</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Bulgaria, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Bulgaria’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>Bulgaria isn’t in the Schengen area. The Schengen area countries apply the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">90-day visa waiver rule</a> as a group.</p>

<p>This means if you visit one or more of the Schengen area countries within a 180 day-period, it all counts towards the Schengen 90-day limit.</p>

<p>Bulgaria applies a separate 90-day limit. It doesn’t apply the 90 days as a group with the Schengen area countries.</p>

<p>This means you can spend up to 90 days in a 180-day period in other European countries and it won’t affect how long you can spend in Bulgaria. You’ll still be able to stay in Bulgaria visa-free for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.</p>

<p>You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Bulgaria for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>going to court as witness</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs or conventions</li>
  <li>attending board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>fact-finding visits</li>
  <li>negotiating deals or contracts</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference (unpaid)</li>
  <li>studying</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
  <li>visiting business partners</li>
  <li>attending business meetings</li>
  <li>touring a company facility</li>
  <li>buying goods for sale outside the country</li>
  <li>receiving classroom-based training</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your entire stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip, or other written proof, such as an invite to a seminar, interview or conference</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Bulgaria’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>Bulgaria does not have any exemptions. You must apply for a work permit if you want to work in Bulgaria.</p>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Bulgaria’s embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Bulgaria’s embassy</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>If you have a family they won’t be able to apply for dependant permits for short trips. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver rules</a>.</p>

<p>There may be different rules for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvr.bg/migration/en/administrative-services/administrative-servces/issue-of-residence-permits-to-third-country-nationals" rel="external">taking your family</a> if you have a long-term permit.</p>

<h3>Short and long-term visas and permits</h3>

<p>You have to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.az.government.bg/pages/komandirovane-za-srok-ot-3-ili-6-meseca/" rel="external">register for short-term employment</a> if you’re in Bulgaria for up to 90 days in a 12-month period because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#register">transferring short term from a UK-based company to a branch in Bulgaria</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#register">providing short-term services to a client in Bulgaria for your UK-based employer</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you work for a tour operator you can work for up to 180 days in a 12-month period.</p>

<p>You need to apply for a long-term work permit if you’re in Bulgaria because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring long term from a UK-based company to a branch in Bulgaria</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">providing long-term services to a client in Bulgaria</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a company in Bulgaria on a long-term Bulgarian contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed (freelance) work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research work</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Long-term permits are valid for up to 4 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<p>You’re issued with a national D visa first and you collect your work permit once you get to Bulgaria. If you’re staying longer than your visa you need to apply for a residence permit.</p>

<h2>Register short-term employment</h2>

<p>You need to be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.az.government.bg/pages/komandirovane-za-srok-ot-3-ili-6-meseca/" rel="external">registered for employment</a> if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transferring short term to a branch in Bulgaria</li>
  <li>providing short-term services to a client in Bulgaria for your UK employer</li>
</ul>

<p>To qualify, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep your UK employment</li>
  <li>stay on UK payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>Employment registration takes 10 days. It’s valid for up to 90 days (180 days for tour operators) in a 12-month period and you can’t extend it.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You need to check with Bulgaria’s authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The Bulgarian company registers your employment with the central administration of the employment agency in person, or by registered post. If sending it by post, they need to make sure they get evidence of delivery (a return receipt). This is to show it was submitted at least 10 days before you’re due to start work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bulgarian company notifies the General Labour Inspectorate of where you’ll be working once you’re registered. They must do this within 7 days of registering your employment.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>Bulgaria’s authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK passport with 2 blank pages, valid for 3 months after your intended departure date</li>
  <li>3 completed original application forms (not photocopies), signed and stamped by the Bulgarian company</li>
  <li>service contract between your UK employer and the Bulgarian company</li>
  <li>assignment agreement with your UK employer</li>
  <li>declaration of compliance with Bulgarian labour laws</li>
  <li>original company registration certificate for the UK company</li>
  <li>confirmation letter issued by your UK employer with the terms and conditions of your short-term work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transferring long-term to a branch in Bulgaria or providing services to a client in Bulgaria</h2>

<p>You need a long-term work permit if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transferring from a UK company to a branch in Bulgaria</li>
  <li>providing services to a client in Bulgaria for a UK company</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for an <a class="govuk-link" href="#ict"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> intra-company transfer (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="intra-company transfer">ICT</abbr>) permit</a> if you’re a manager, specialist or trainee working for at least 1 year.</p>

<p>If you don’t qualify for an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="intra-company transfer">ICT</abbr> you can apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#posted">work permit (for posted workers)</a>.</p>

<p>You can also apply for this if you’re providing services to a client in Bulgaria for up to 1 year.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> intra-company transfer (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="intra-company transfer">ICT</abbr>) permit</h3>
<p>You need a long-term <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="intra-company transfer">ICT</abbr> permit if your UK-based company moves you to a Bulgarian branch to work for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 3 years</li>
  <li>1 year if you’re a trainee</li>
</ul>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a manager, specialist or trainee</li>
  <li>have a bachelor’s level degree if you’re a trainee</li>
  <li>have relevant professional experience and qualifications if you’re working as a specialist or manager</li>
  <li>have worked for the UK company for at least 12 months if you’re a manager or specialist, or 6 months if you’re a trainee</li>
  <li>meet minimum salary requirements – you need to check the required amount with the Bulgarian authorities as it may change over time</li>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract</li>
  <li>stay on UK payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>An <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="intra-company transfer">ICT</abbr> permit can take between 12 to 16 weeks to get. It can’t be extended beyond 3 years or 1 year for trainees.</p>

<p>If you have a spouse, or children under 18 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvr.bg/migration/en/administrative-services/administrative-servces/issue-of-residence-permits-to-third-country-nationals" rel="external">they can join you</a> with this permit type.</p>
