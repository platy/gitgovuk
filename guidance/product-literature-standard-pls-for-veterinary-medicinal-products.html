<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Product Literature Standard (PLS) should be taken into account when creating mock-ups for assessment.</p>

<p>Taking note of the following will greatly enhance your chances of getting your mock-ups right first time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow the approved QRD text (if available) or the approved SPC (if no QRD) and information in this document</li>
  <li>If you wish to deviate from the above, contact the relevant authority before submitting mock-ups</li>
  <li>Deviating from the above will only be permitted in very exceptional circumstances – it is up to you to agree the wording during the assessment phase of the application procedure and / or before the mock-up review process</li>
  <li>Minor deviations are permitted to correct grammatical errors.</li>
  <li>If you are asked to make changes, please make them and do not make any other changes without agreeing it with the relevant authority first.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Joint labelling with Ireland</h2>

<p>Joint labelling could be achieved between GB and IE, NI and IE or all 3 - GB, IE and NI. You can apply either at the end of a new MA procedure or retrospectively for existing MAs, whether authorised by EU or national procedures.</p>

<p>To obtain joint labelling, the SPC/QRD must be identical in both the UK and IE. This can be achieved by applying for a harmonisation variation in both countries. To maintain joint labelling the SPC/QRD must remain harmonised.</p>

<h2>Templates</h2>

<p>You must provide draft QRD text using the appropriate template. For initial GB-national only Marketing Authorisations (MAs) validated on or after 28 January 2022, you must use the&nbsp;updated <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1083605/PCDOCS-_2248249-v1-Updated_GB_SPC_QRD_Template.pdf">National SPC/QRD Template</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">234 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">15 pages</span>)</span>.  An <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1083608/PCDOCS-_2345490-v1-Annotated_Updated_National_SPC_QRD_Template.pdf">annotated version of this template </a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">377 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">33 pages</span>)</span> is available which provides supporting guidance on the information requirements listed.</p>

<p>For GB-national MAs granted or validated before 28 January 2022, you may continue to use the original <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/969377/_1613255-v3-Updated_GOV_UK_National_QRD_Combined_Template.odt" rel="external">National SPC/QRD Template</a> (ODT,&nbsp;44.5KB).</p>

<p>For mutually recognised MAs you must use the template provided in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hma.eu/583.html" rel="external">Best Practice Guides</a>.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/veterinary-medicines-summary-of-product-characteristics-and-product-literature">Summary of Product Characteristics and product literature for veterinary medicines</a> for more information on the application process relating to mock-ups in the UK.</p>

<h2>Before you create mock-ups</h2>

<p>The amount of space you have available on packaging should be considered from the outset and throughout the assessment process. The amount of text included on the QRD must reflect the size of the label.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about fitting the agreed text onto your packaging you must discuss this with the relevant assessor during the assessment phase before the QRD text is agreed.</p>

<h2>Designing mock-ups</h2>

<p>The following should be taken into consideration during the design of mock-ups.</p>

<h3>Font type and size:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>font type should be easy to read and not overly stylised, which can be difficult to read</li>
  <li>choose a font that clearly distinguishes between similar characters such as i, l and 1</li>
  <li>capitals should be avoided but can be used to emphasise words</li>
  <li>Italics should be used for Latin terms when citing correct nomenclature and microorganisms</li>
  <li>font size should be as large as possible and must be clearly legible to the user. Font size should be measured against Times New Roman. If you can’t use the recommended font sizes list below, please include a justification for this when submitting mock-ups</li>
</ul>

<p>*only in exceptional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>Colour</h3>

<ul>
  <li>colours should have a good contrast between the text and the background</li>
  <li>legibility of information should not be compromised by the colours chosen. Preferably, dark text should be printed on a light background, but the reverse may also be applied in certain circumstances, such as to highlight a particular warning</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design and Layout</h3>

<ul>
  <li>legibility of information should not be compromised by design. Consider, whether the layout, font size and legibility has been fully optimised</li>
  <li>where possible line spaces should be kept clear which enhances clarity</li>
  <li>column text formatting is acceptable but the margin between columns should be large enough to separate the text clearly</li>
  <li>if space is limited a vertical line may be used to separate text. Related information should be kept together so that information flows from one column to the next</li>
</ul>

<h3>Headings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>bold type and different colour headings can help information stand out and users navigate the text</li>
  <li>spacing above and below the headings should be consistent throughout the packaging</li>
  <li>avoid using multiple headings as using more than two levels may cause confusion</li>
  <li>use of QRD headings on the immediate and outer packaging is not obligatory, but you must include headings that clearly convey meaning, such as ‘withdrawal period’</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use of Images and Symbols</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you can include clear diagrams and images in addition to wording, provided they are not misleading or cause confusion</li>
  <li>symbols and images can be useful provided the meaning is clear and that the size of the image is legible</li>
</ul>

<h2>Labelling requirements</h2>

<p>If it is not practical to include all the information on the immediate or outer packaging, a package leaflet must be included and the statement ‘Read the package leaflet before use’ should appear on the immediate and outer packaging.</p>

<p>The front and back of the label should include all QRD requirements for an immediate label/outer carton. This ensures that if the front portions of the label are torn off, the rear label will retain the minimum required text. If the immediate label is small, assessors may agree for reduced text to be applied on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>It is important that the information on a blister pack remains available to the user up to the point when the last dose is removed.  Often, it is not possible to display all the information over each blister pocket, therefore, random displays of information should appear frequently. It is acceptable to apply the batch number and expiry date at the end of the blister.</p>

<p>National specific information should be included in the country specific box on official joint-labels.  This should include any information that is specific to that country only. Any information that applies to both countries should be included in the main text outside this box.</p>

<h3>Multilingual Labels</h3>

<p>Multilingual labels and packaging must have English translation and each different language should have a clear separation. All information provided in each language should be kept together. The inclusion of multiple language text must ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>requirements of the VMD are respected</li>
  <li>legibility of the English text is not compromised</li>
  <li>information given is identical in all languages. The VMD will only assess the English text on the label</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multicountry Labels for Marketing Authorisations Granted under the Centralised Procedure</h3>

<p>For veterinary medicines authorised under the Centralised Procedure in the EU and where a parallel, identical GB marketing authorisation/application has been issued or received, the VMD will not enforce Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013 (VMR) Schedule 1 Part 7, paragraph 50 (1) as it has affect in GB in regards to inclusion of all product information on the package leaflet when this cannot be presented on the immediate or outer packaging. Specifically, the VMD will not enforce a requirement for inclusion of the name and address of the GB marketing authorisation holder/distributor (if different to the EU marketing authorisation holder information), and the GB Vm number on the accompanying package leaflet.</p>

<p>Instead, if the name and address of the GB marketing authorisation holder/distributor (if different to the EU marketing authorisation holder information), and the GB Vm number are not included on the package leaflet, information specific to GB are to appear in the ‘Blue Box’ on the outer packaging (or immediate packaging if no outer packaging). The country abbreviations GB or UK(GB) and UK(NI) are acceptable for use on all packaging and leaflets. The abbreviation ‘XI’ for Northern Ireland should not be used.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>UK(NI) and UK(GB) or GB: legal category</p>

<p>[Paragraph break]</p>

<p>UK(GB) or GB: Vm XXXXX/XXXX</p>

<p>MAH/distributor name and address [if different to EU information]</p>

<p>[Any further national specific information, such as indication if the product is an anthelmintic or controlled drug]</p>
</div>

<p>This exceptional VMD enforcement policy only applies in instances where the GB and EU SPC and QRD, as agreed under the respective procedures, are the same. Where divergence occurs, a single multi-country label will not be achievable and national labelling requirements as described in Schedule 1 Part 7 of the VMR apply in respect of the GB product.</p>

<h3>Dual Labelling</h3>

<p>Mock-ups are assessed nationally with no communication between other National Competent Authorities.</p>

<p>All national requirements will be applicable.</p>

<p>The MAH should be aware that information in all languages may not remain consistent if variations are submitted.</p>

<h3>Strength and total content</h3>

<p>Sometimes packaging may need to include both quantity per unit volume and total quantity per total volume. Different strengths of the same product should be expressed in the same format.</p>

<p>Unless space is limited, micrograms should be spelt out in full. Trailing zeros should not be used, for example 2.5 mg not 2.50 mg.</p>

<h3>Company websites</h3>

<p>You can’t refer to company websites. You can include an email address and/or telephone number.</p>

<h3>Anthelmintics</h3>

<p>In the UK, we have a voluntary labelling scheme for the inclusion of chemical group symbols on sheep anthelmintics. You can also use the scheme for other species.</p>

<p>Through the use of approved symbols, users can easily identify the chemical group which helps efforts to delay the development of anthelmintic resistance. The symbol should in a prominent position on the outer carton, immediate label and package leaflet.</p>

<p>A minimum diameter of 10 mm is suggested for the symbol on the outer carton, which can be scaled up for larger presentations.</p>

<p>No symbol is required for narrow spectrum anthelmintics such as closantel.</p>
<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Approved symbols and diameters" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/116932/PDf_5.JPG"></div>
<figcaption><p>Examples of approved symbols and the diameters which should be used.</p></figcaption></figure>

<h3>QR Codes</h3>

<p>A QR code or 2D barcode may be added providing legibility of the required text is not compromised and only accesses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information intended for internal manufacturing processing, stock control or anti-counterfeit measures that cannot be accessed by the public</li>
  <li>public information which conforms to the VMD (or HPRA for joint labels) approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics, label or package leaflet for that product).  Links to company websites are considered promotional and cannot be included.</li>
</ul>

<p>To add a QR code to existing packaging you will need to submit a Type IB variation. The variation must include a detailed account of information to which this code links and any significant changes to this information would require the submission of a further variation.</p>

<p>Once a QR code has been approved the MAH is responsible for ensuring that the information included in the QR code is in line with the approved SPC.</p>

<h3>Product ranges</h3>

<p>There should be a separate SPC and product literature for each strength and pharmaceutical form of a veterinary medicine.</p>

<p>You may be able to combine package leaflets for products that are different strengths and/or different pharmaceutical forms. If a combined package leaflet is required, this should be raised during the assessment phase when the QRD text is being agreed and before the mock-up review process.</p>

<p>A combined package leaflet will only be agreed if the contents are identical for each product and the combination does not cause confusion for the user.</p>

<h2>Mock-ups requirements</h2>

<p>This section describes the specific details that must appear on each of the different packaging types.</p>

<p>If you cannot fit all the required information on the relevant packaging, and an outer carton is used, you should include the statement “Keep the container in the outer carton” on all product literature.</p>

<p>If space is available, you may be asked to include extra information especially in the case of Provisional and Limited Marketing Authorisations.</p>

<p>You can also download a <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1010530/PCDOCS-_2017326-v2-Prod_Lit_Table_draft.pdf">check-list table</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">178 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">4 pages</span>)</span> of the following requirements.</p>

<figcaption><p>“CD” should appear either in a triangle (preferably) or in a box with the relevant schedule below.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The CD symbol should be included on labels (where space permits), outer packaging and on the package leaflet. This does not need to be included on blister packs or small immediate labels.</p>

<h3>Exceptional Marketing Authorisations (MAs)</h3>

<p>Exceptional MAs are subject to normal labelling requirements, but are also required to include the following information on the packaging:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A clear statement that the product does not have a full Marketing Authorisation and to highlight areas of ‘weakness’. For example: “This is a Limited Marketing Authorisation. A full set of supporting safety and efficacy data is not available for the product”</li>
  <li>The statement “All suspected adverse reactions and any suspected lack of efficacy should be reported to [company pharmacovigilance phone number and address]”</li>
  <li>The statement “Further information on this product and its supporting data can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/" rel="external">Product Information Database</a>”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parallel Import Marketing Authorisations (MAPI)</h3>

<p>MAPIs are subject to normal labelling requirements but must also include the following information on the packaging. A photograph of the over-labelled product may be requested to ensure that any foreign text which does not comply with the UK requirements is not visible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>MAPI holder name and address: ‘Manufactured by (name of original MAH)’, ‘Procured from within the EU and repackaged by the licence holder’ (Name and address of MAPI holder’</li>
  <li>Adverse reactions: The MAPI holder must provide a UK telephone number for reporting adverse events.</li>
  <li>Batch Number: The original manufacturers batch number should be included</li>
  <li>Expiry Date: The original manufacturers expiry date should be included</li>
</ul>

<p>It is the importer’s responsibility to give notice to the original MAH or trademark owner before the repackaged product is put on sale, and, on demand, supply the original MAH with a specimen of the repackaged product. The VMD do not assess or provide comment on the presence or absence of the respective company logos</p>

<h3>Dedicated Dispensing Containers</h3>

<p>If submitted to the VMD with the authorised packaging, they are considered to form part of the authorised packaging and will be subject to the same level of mock-up assessment.</p>

<h2>Mock-ups assessment</h2>

<p>Mock-ups supplied in support of an application to the VMD must be in accordance with the Product Literature Standard and presented as a flat artwork design in full colour. We will assess all mock-ups submitted in support of a national GB and/or NI application. This includes assessment of mock-ups for GB national applications submitted in parallel to an EU centralised procedure</p>

<p>Mock-ups are assessed against the agreed QRD text and SPC, the Product Literature Standard and any other information provided by or discussed with you.</p>

<p>Mock-ups submitted should not deviate from the agreed QRD text and/or SPC. However, in exceptional cases, you may be allowed to deviate but you must contact us to discuss this before submitting your mock-ups. Not doing so will delay the approval of your mock-ups and subsequent issue of the application.</p>

<p>The following are not assessed and should not be submitted with applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shipping packs</li>
  <li>datasheets, including Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs)</li>
  <li>packaging for wholesalers that do not include any labels</li>
  <li>display packaging</li>
  <li>promotional material</li>
  <li>dispensing envelopes are not required. However, if submitted to the VMD with the authorised packaging, they are considered to form part of the authorised packaging and will be subject to assessment</li>
</ul>

<h3>No mock-ups</h3>

<p>If you do not want to submit mock-ups (for certain pack sizes), or mock-ups are not submitted within the deadlines set, your application will be issued with a condition that mock-ups will need to be submitted for assessment under cover of a national C.II.6(b) Type IB variation category, prior to marketing.</p>

<h3>Mock-up changes that require a variation</h3>

<p>Any changes not already covered by a specific variation classification that may affect the legibility of the mock-up must be approved by way of a national G.I.15 variation requiring assessment (VRA), for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new corporate design of packaging</li>
  <li>new container type / size</li>
  <li>changes to the layout of the package</li>
  <li>introduction of multilingual packs for an already approved authorised product</li>
  <li>introduction of mock-ups for an authorised pack size</li>
</ul>

<p>You should only submit the mock-ups for the packaging/labelling that is affected.</p>

<h3>Notifications</h3>

<p>Minor mock-up changes that do not affect the font size, layout or legibility do not require a variation, for example a change to the barcode, logo (assuming same size), change of IE national specific text.</p>

<p>If you are in doubt about whether a variation is needed, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:notification@vmd.gov.uk">notification@vmd.gov.uk</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:vetinfo@hpra.ie">vetinfo@hpra.ie</a>.</p>

<p>If the VMD agrees that no variation is required, we will confirm this with you and make a note of the changes in our records. This does not mean the VMD has assessed or approved the described change(s) only that they can be made without the need for a variation. You are not required to submit revised mock-ups to the VMD but they can help to clarify the change.</p>

<h3>Assessment timescales</h3>

<p>Mock-ups will be assessed within 20 days of receipt of correct versions.</p>

<p>If only minor amendments to existing approved mock-ups are needed we will annotate your existing approved mock-ups, otherwise new mock-ups will be requested. You will be notified of this within 4 days of the procedure ending.</p>

<p>If the mock-ups contain errors, or are not suitable, you will receive a comments document listing any proposed changes. You should update the mock-ups to incorporate the proposed changes and return revised versions as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You will only receive 1 comments document. If the revised mock ups are still incorrect a condition will be applied to the authorisation to introduce corrected mock ups under the cover of a suitable national variation prior to marketing.</p>
