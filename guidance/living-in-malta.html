<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you were resident in Malta before 1 January 2021, you need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malta-how-to-register-for-the-e-residency-card" class="govuk-link">apply for a new residency card by 30 June 2021</a>.</p>

<p>If you have been living in Malta for three months or more and have not yet registered for residency, or if your residence document has expired, you should contact Identity Malta by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:eu.ima@gov.mt">eu.ima@gov.mt</a>.</p>

<p>Read the Maltese government’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/IdentityMaltaAgency/posts/?ref=page_internal" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on residency on the Identity Malta Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the impact of coronavirus, Identity Malta temporarily paused some parts of this service. The full application process re-launched on 1 July 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you have already received a letter to obtain your new card, you should attend your appointment</li>
  <li>if you have already registered but have not yet received a letter you should contact Identity Malta to book an appointment to apply for your new card</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional support</h3>

<p>UK nationals who were resident in Malta before 1 January 2021, and need help to complete their residence application, can get support from organisations funded by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-allocates-3-million-to-support-uk-nationals-in-the-eu">UK Nationals Support Fund</a>.</p>

<p>This support is only available to people who need additional help to secure their rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. They may include pensioners, disabled people, people living in remote areas or people who have mobility difficulties.</p>

<p>Support available includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>answering questions about residence applications, such as the documents you need and how the application process works</li>
  <li>guiding you through the process, if necessary</li>
  <li>support if you experience language barriers or difficulty accessing online information and services</li>
</ul>

<p>If you, or someone you know, are having difficulty completing residence paperwork or have any questions, contact the IOM:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://malta.iom.int/uk-nationals-support-fund">IOM Malta website</a></li>
  <li>email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:UKnationalsMT@iom.int">UKnationalsMT@iom.int</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to Malta</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/malta/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements</a> for <a rel="external" href="https://identitymalta.com/unit/central-visa-unit/" class="govuk-link">Malta and read the Maltese government’s guidance on visas</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence card (EU card or eResidence card), as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your card, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence card, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Malta. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Malta, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Malta.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Malta.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Malta, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on it.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" rel="external">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland will not change.</p>

<h2>Driving in Malta</h2>

<p>You should exchange your UK driving licence for a Maltese one by 1 July 2021.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Malta, you can read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad" class="govuk-link">what you need to drive abroad</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/malta/safety-and-security#road-travel">driving rules in Malta</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also read the EU’s guidance on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/driving-licence/driving-licence-renewal-exchange/index_en.htm">exchanging or renewing your driving licence</a>.</p>

<h3>Driving in the UK with a Maltese licence</h3>

<p>You can use your Maltese licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test. We will update these pages if there are any changes to the rules, as soon as information is available.</p>

<h3>Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Malta</h3>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk">guidance on taking a vehicle out of the UK.</a></p>

<p>Once you’re resident in Malta, your imported car <a rel="external" href="https://www.transport.gov.mt/land/registering-and-licensing-a-motor-vehicle/registering-and-licensing-a-motor-vehicle-as-an-individual-804" class="govuk-link">must have Maltese number plates.</a></p>

<p>Read the European Union’s <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/malta/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on car registration and taxes in Malta.</a> You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are legally resident in Malta and paying into the Maltese Social Security System, you will be entitled to full access to healthcare and you will be able to apply for a Maltese EHIC.</p>

<p>If you don’t qualify for healthcare cover through your national security contributions, you should check if you are eligible to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/cbhc/Pages/Entitlement/Reciprocal-Agreement-MaltaUK.aspx" rel="external">apply for the Maltese RHA Entitlement Card</a>.</p>

<p>Your RHA Entitlement Card allows you to register at your <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/phc/Pages/Health-Centres/Overview.aspx">nearest health centre</a> on the Maltese government website and make GP appointments. You will need to bring an identity card or passport. RHA Entitlement Card holders are not entitled to long-term care and treatment outside Malta and are not eligible for a Maltese European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).</p>

<p>In an emergency, go directly to <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/MDH/Pages/Home.aspx">Mater Dei Hospital</a> or <a href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/ggh/Pages/Home.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Gozo General Hospital</a>.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-malta" class="govuk-link">healthcare in Malta</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Malta temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-malta#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Malta before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same from if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Malta and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-malta#s1">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>Visiting the UK as an S1 holder</h3>

<p>If you visit the UK whilst residing abroad and require medical treatment, you must provide a copy of your S1 certificate. In some EU member states the S1 certificate is requested and retained in order for you to receive healthcare. If you do not have a copy or need to get a new certificate, you must contact the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 191 218 1999.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Malta, you must not use an EHIC from the UK to access healthcare in Malta.</p>

<p>If you were living in Malta before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Malta</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a>.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h2>Working and studying in Malta</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Malta before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>If you are planning to come to Malta to work, you may need a visa. Read the Maltese government’s <a href="https://identitymalta.com/unit/central-visa-unit/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get a visa and other necessary documents</a>.</p>
