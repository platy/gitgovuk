<p>Sexual violence and abuse is unacceptable in any situation.</p>

<p>For anyone who feels they are at risk of sexual violence or abuse, or is experiencing heightened mental health issues because of having previously survived sexual violence and abuse in the past, it is important to remember that there is help and support available to you. Support is also available to help perpetrators change their behaviour.</p>

<p>The government supports and funds the NHS and a number of charities  who are able to provide support and advice.</p>

<h2>What is sexual violence and abuse?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Rape</li>
  <li>Child sexual abuse</li>
  <li>Sexual assault</li>
  <li>Sexual abuse (this includes being pressurised or coerced into sexual activity you do not want to do)</li>
  <li>Sexual exploitation</li>
  <li>Image-based sexual abuse (non-consensual creation and/or distribution of private, sexual images and videos)</li>
  <li>Grooming for sexual purposes</li>
  <li>Female genital mutilation</li>
