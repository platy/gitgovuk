<h2>Book and plan your visit to Bristol prison</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Bristol Prison you must:</p>

  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-bristol-prison">the required ID</a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<h3>Entering Bristol Prison</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID for all visitors.</a></p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Visitors should dress appropriately. You may be turned away if you are wearing items like revealing clothing or clothing with offensive slogans. Ask at the visitors centre if you have questions about appropriate dress.</p>

<p>Each group of visitors is allowed to take in a maximum of £50 to buy food and drink from the snack bar in the visiting hall.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Bristol Prison. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you behind. Lockers are available in the visitors centre. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There is a visitors centre run by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonadvice.org.uk/hmp-bristol" rel="external">The Prison Advice and Care Trust (PACT)</a>. Family and friends can relax, buy refreshments and get advice and support from the staff.</p>

<p>It is open from midday on visiting days.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Bristol Prison</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Bristol Prison.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how secure video calls work</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>All prisoners have phones in their rooms which they can use at any time. The phones do not accept incoming calls so they will always need to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Bristol Prison using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Bristol Prison.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Bristol Prison</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>Friends and family can hand in the following items before a visit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>underwear, socks and court clothes (shirts, trousers, shoes, ties and jackets)</li>
  <li>books (not puzzle books or magazines)</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s also possible to send these items and other kinds of clothing and footwear by post. For this, you will need a property voucher which the prisoner must apply for and send you by post. Fix the voucher to your parcel before sending it in.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the order. They will be opened and checked by officers. For court clothes, allow at least 5 days for the parcel to be searched and reach the prisoner.</p>

<p>Any parcels without a property voucher or that look to be tampered with will be refused.</p>

<p>Prisoners can buy a variety of items for themselves from the canteen and through a catalogue system.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>If the prisoner has cash when they arrive, they will have the chance to buy canteen supplies and add money to their phone account.</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>They will also get a gym induction so they can safely use the gym facilities.</p>

<p>Everyone also finds out about the rules, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
