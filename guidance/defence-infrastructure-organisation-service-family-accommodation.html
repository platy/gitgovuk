<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The provision of good quality homes for Service personnel and their families is an important priority for the Ministry of Defence (<abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>).</p>

<p>The Defence Infrastructure Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>) manages around 49,000 homes in the UK on behalf of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and is also responsible for planning for future requirements and targeted improvement programmes.</p>

<p>On 1 April 2022 the new Future Defence Infrastructure Services (<abbr title="Future Defence Infrastructure Services">FDIS</abbr>) Accommodation contracts replaced the National Housing Prime (<abbr title="National Housing Prime">NHP</abbr>) contract. These new contracts fulfil the Defence requirement for the delivery of effective and responsive accommodation services for Service personnel and their families.</p>

<p>On behalf of <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>, Pinnacle Group Ltd manage the National Accommodation Management Services (NAMS) contract in the UK. Their National Service Centre is the single point of contact for requests from families living in Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>) including raising repairs and maintenance issues, the allocations of homes and conducting move-in and move-out appointments. Contact details can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pinnacleservicefamilies.co.uk/" rel="external">Pinnacle Service Families website</a>.</p>

<p>Four Regional Accommodation Maintenance Services (RAMS) contracts provide statutory and mandatory checks, repair and maintenance services and the preparation of allocated homes for Service families. Amey Community Ltd manage the Northern and Central regions and VIVO cover the South East and South West.</p>

<h2>Latest news for <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> residents</h2>

<h3>Update 15 September 2022 - Bank holiday for the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and arrangements for Service Family Accommodation appointments</h3>

<p>Monday 19 September, the date of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral, will be a national bank holiday across the UK. To allow Service personnel, their families and service family accommodation staff to pay their respects to Her Majesty on the final day of national mourning, the following arrangements have been made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emergency and urgent appointments: Pinnacle’s emergency repairs phone line is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and will not be impacted by the bank holiday. If you have an emergency, then please call 0800 031 862.</li>
  <li>Move-ins: Pinnacle will contact all families who have a move-in appointment arranged for 19 September to give them the opportunity to rearrange if they wish.</li>
  <li>Routine repairs: VIVO and Amey will contact all families by telephone who have routine repairs scheduled for 19 September to rearrange. In instances where families cannot be reached by telephone, VIVO or Amey will email families and ask them to contact Pinnacle to rearrange the appointment for another convenient date.</li>
  <li>Mandatory gas and electrical safety checks: Pinnacle will contact all families with a mandatory safety check scheduled for 19 September to rearrange this appointment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Update 18 August 2022</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, a number of appointments had been missed due to issues with contractor IT systems.</p>

<p>The issues have now been resolved and fixes have been deployed. Our contractors have worked hard to address the resulting backlogs, including contacting impacted families to apologise and confirm or rearrange appointments as needed. Compensation is also being paid to all affected families.</p>

<h3>Update 12 August 2022</h3>

<h4>Missed Appointments in the North and Central Regions</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, a number of missed appointments were experienced by families earlier this week in Amey’s North and Central regions. This was a result of a server security certificate expiring on 7 August which meant appointments did not transfer from Amey’s scheduling system to its operatives’ hand-held devices from 7-9 August.</p>

<p>When the problem became apparent, Amey’s Regional Service Centre staff intervened to schedule engineers by telephone to attend the planned appointments. Where appointments are confirmed to have been missed, Amey’s Regional Service Centre will issue an apology, re-book appointments and proactively issue compensation.</p>

<h4>Safety Notice Regarding Checking Window Restrictors in <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The safety of families living in Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>) and Substitute Service Families Accommodation (<abbr title="substitute service family accommodation">SSFA</abbr>) is a top priority. With warmer weather meaning more windows will be open in homes, we would like to remind families to check that all window safety catches/restrictors are working correctly.</p>

<p>If restrictors are not working or windows can be opened more than 100mm when restrictors are engaged, then please report the fault to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pinnacleservicefamilies.co.uk/" rel="external">National Service Centre</a> immediately on 0800 031 8628 to ensure a repair is carried out. If you live in <abbr title="substitute service family accommodation">SSFA</abbr>, please contact Mears on 0800 032 4547.</p>

<p>Please note that window restrictors must not be disengaged for any reason where children or vulnerable members of your household are at risk from falling.</p>

<p>For more advice about preventing accidents in your home visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://capt.org.uk/falls/" rel="external">Child Accident Prevention Trust website</a>.</p>

<h4>Gas and Electrical Statutory and Mandatory Inspections</h4>

<p>It is a legal requirement to undertake gas and electrical safety checks in your home to reduce the potential for a carbon monoxide incident or an electrical fire and thereby to keep you and your family safe from harm.</p>

<p>If your property is due a gas or electrical check the regional contractor (VIVO or Amey) will contact you to arrange a suitable time for the check to take place. It is extremely important that you respond to an email to confirm the appointment date and time is suitable. VIVO or Amey can change the appointment time if it is unsuitable.</p>

<p>If gas appliances are not serviced regularly, they can lead to leaks and carbon monoxide poisoning.&nbsp; This is a highly poisonous has that can kill quickly with no warning as you can’t see it, taste it or smell it. In extreme circumstances, faults can also cause major explosions.</p>

<p>It is really important for your safety that you allow the Regional Accommodation Maintenance Services contractors (VIVO or Amey) access to your home to carry out these vital safety checks.</p>

<p>Please help us keep you safe by being present when your appointment is booked, or by contacting the VIVO or Amey to rearrange if the time is not suitable.</p>

<h3>Update 10 August 2022</h3>

<h4>Missed appointments in the South East and South West regions</h4>

<p>The fix to resolve the missed appointments in the South East and South West regions has been successful and reports of missed appointments are now very low. &nbsp;We will continue to monitor this situation closely.</p>

<p>Compensation vouchers have been issued to all families who have raised claims or complaints regarding these missed appointments. VIVO continue to work to clear the backlog of tasks as quickly as possible and have employed 35 additional engineers to support this work. Over 90% of the tasks have been completed.</p>

<h4>Impact of increase of cost of living for Service personnel and families living in Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The UK energy market has recently seen an unprecedented rise in electricity and gas prices and domestic customers across the country have witnessed a 54% annual increase in the average energy bill with further rises expected later in the year. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/energy-bills-support-scheme-explainer">Energy Bills Support Scheme</a> will deliver a £400 non-repayable discount to eligible households, including <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> on a civilian fuel supply, to help with energy bills from October 2022.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s People Policy team is currently reviewing how the global increase in the cost of living will impact Service personnel and their families living in service family homes. Although <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> do not lead on the policy or determine the energy costs, we want to keep Service personnel and their families updated. Please keep checking this page for updates.</p>

<p>This update provides information for families living in <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> where they pay energy bills direct to a civilian supplier, families who live in homes on an <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> fuel supply and families who live in homes on the Fuel Subsidy Scheme. It also covers homes with oil heating systems.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> on a civilian fuel supply</h4>

<p>Most families will receive and pay for their gas and electricity direct from a civilian energy provider. These families will receive the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/energy-bills-support-scheme-explainer">Energy Bill Support Scheme</a> of £400 which will be administered through their electricity provider as a credit on their electricity bill from October 2022 onwards.&nbsp;The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/check-if-energy-price-cap-affects-you" rel="external">OFGEM Energy Price Cap</a> applies to these costs. The Energy Price Cap is intended to limit how much suppliers can charge consumers for utilities.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> on the Fuel Subsidy Scheme</h4>

<p>Families living in homes on the Fuel Subsidy Scheme (FSS) pay the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> direct for their gas and electricity via JPA. <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> procure both electricity and gas for these homes via the commercial market rather than the domestic market. Even with the recent increase in Fuel Subsidy tariffs, the saving from paying commercial rather than domestic rates is currently greater than the government’s £400 grant. Therefore, although they are not eligible for the Energy Bill Support Scheme, families in FSS homes will not be disadvantaged.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> on an <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Fuel Supply</h4>

<p>Families living in <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> on an <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> fuel supply are billed via a 1571 voucher rather than having the charges deduced automatically via JPA like with FSS. Again, these families will not be eligible for the government’s £400 grant but they, too, will not be disadvantaged as they pay less than the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/check-if-energy-price-cap-affects-you" rel="external">Ofgem cap,</a> even taking into account the £400 grant.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s People Policy Team will continue to review <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> on the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> fuel portfolio and FSS that are not eligible for the government’s £400 grant – or any subsequent support - to ensure they are not disadvantaged. Please keep checking this site for updates.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Utilities has put together a frequently asked questions list which provides further information regarding the rise in electricity and gas prices: <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1097475/DIO_Utilities_Energy_Prices_FAQs.pdf"><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Utilities Energy Prices FAQs</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">139 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">2 pages</span>)</span></p>

<h4>Assistance for families living in Service family homes with the extra costs of oil-fired heating systems</h4>

<p>The government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/energy-bills-support-scheme-explainer">Energy Bill Support Scheme</a> will be administered through electricity providers, so all families using civilian electricity providers should see the £400 grant as a credit on their electricity bill from October 2022 onwards.&nbsp;This is intended to provide support for all utilities costs despite the fact it will go into families’ electricity accounts, so will help to offset the increase cost of oil or gas depending on the fuel the home uses.</p>

<p>However, we recognise that oil costs are also high. To ensure families who live in oil heated homes are not disadvantaged, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>’s People Policy team are looking at ways to support these affected. We will update this page as soon as the policy is released.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> is also looking at the impact on families who need to arrange an oil delivery that they won’t fully consume before they move out, noting that minimum deliveries are generally 500 litres and sometimes families can leave several hundred litres of very expensive fuel for the next family. We will update this page as soon as details of this are released.</p>

<p>In addition, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is working to deliver alternative solutions that heat the home with greater efficiency to provide both energy and cost savings to families. This will focus on the 1200 homes that have oil heating systems. This financial year, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is looking to replace oil boilers to 520 homes using a combination of Air Source Heat Pumps and Thermal Energy Storage solutions. These systems will reduce carbon emissions, as well as reducing utility costs for families, but in most cases works will also need to upgrade the thermal efficiency of the homes through a combination of replacement doors, windows and/or insulation.</p>

<p>The current plan to install alternate heating solutions to all homes will take into account government carbon emission reduction strategies as well as reducing the reliance of oil-fired boilers by the end of 2023 so that families can benefit from greater heating efficiencies and reduced utility costs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is also planning to fit external wall insulation to 989 homes this year to improve the energy efficiency of many of our least efficient homes – including those with oil heating systems. If families experience any issues such as draughty windows/doors, cold radiators or damp, please report these to Pinnacle on 0800 031 8628 to ensure that homes are as energy efficient as possible.</p>

<p>For further information regarding the cost of oil, the Army Families Federation has created a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://aff.org.uk/advice/housing/repairs-maintenance/" rel="external">useful Q&amp;A document.</a></p>

<h3>Update 25 July 2022</h3>

<p>From Monday 25 July until Friday 2 September the phoneline for families to call to discuss their allocation applications will be available from 8.30am to 3.00pm (currently 8.30am to 4.30pm).&nbsp;This measure will allow Pinnacle to devote the necessary effort to managing the Summer Move Surge, ensuring that they support families appropriately through this period.</p>

<p>Families requesting an update on the progress of their allocation will usually be called back after 3pm, allowing dedicated call time to discuss with families.&nbsp;For those families who are unavailable after 3pm, calls will be made prior to that time.</p>

<p>There are no changes to call times for all other Pinnacle Phonelines.</p>

<h3>Update 21 July 2022</h3>

<p>The average number of missed appointments in the South East and South West regions has reduced to fewer than 10 per day over the last 10 days.&nbsp;Compensation vouchers have been issued to more than three quarters of the families who have raised claims or complaints. The remainder will be issued as soon as possible. VIVO continue to work to clear the backlog of tasks as quickly as possible and have employed 35 additional engineers to support this work. Nearly three quarters of the tasks have been completed.</p>

<h2>Moving in</h2>

<p>When you accept an offer of an <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> home you should arrange a ‘move in’ appointment using the e-1132 system.</p>

<p>At the agreed date and time, a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pinnacleservicefamilies.co.uk/housing-officers/" rel="external">Pinnacle Housing Officer</a> will meet you at the home and show you around.</p>

<p>You can give your spouse/civil partner, or a service colleague written authority (known as a ‘Proxy certificate’) to sign the inventory on your behalf if you are unable to attend the ‘move in’ appointment. Please note that the ‘move in’ can only take place during normal working hours.</p>

<p>If you are moving from one <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> home (not substitute <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>) to another, you have 2 weeks to hand it back, provided you do so within this time you will only be charged for one home. If you exceed this period you may be charged for both properties.</p>

<h3>Housing guide</h3>

<p>Service personnel and their families moving into <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> home should read the guides available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pinnacleservicefamilies.co.uk/" rel="external">Pinnacle website</a>, which contains important information about the services offered and the responsibilities of customers.</p>

<h3>Licence to occupy insurance</h3>

<p>When you live in a <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> home you should ensure that you have adequate insurance. In addition to arranging contents insurance to protect your personal possessions, the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> strongly recommends (in accordance with JSP 464) to take out ‘Licence to occupy’ insurance. This specialist insurance covers your potential liability incurred as a result of damage to your <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> home caused by you or your family and would provide you with cover up to the required £20,000.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://siiap.org/" rel="external">Services Insurance and Investment Advisory Panel (SIIAP)</a> “Services Insurance and Investment Advisory Panel (SIIAP)” website provides details of insurers who can supply this insurance and includes websites and telephone numbers for a range of relevant insurance companies. If you are unable to find relevant information on the websites available, we suggest that you call the insurer using the telephone numbers which are also provided. If you already have Kit insurance with one of these specialist insurers, it may be worth checking if you are already covered, as some insurance policies include Licence to Occupy insurance.</p>

<h2>Investment and Action Plan to tackle damp and mould in <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Providing Service personnel and their families with safe, warm, dry, and compliant homes that are free of damp and mould is a critical priority for <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>. We fully acknowledge that not enough has been done in the past to ensure all homes are free of damp and mould and we are working hard to ensure all homes are to a standard that befits the many sacrifices Service personnel and their families make on behalf of the nation.</p>

<p>Over the years we have been working hard to improve homes. Last year we invested £123m to improve the quality of our homes in the UK and this year we are investing a further £143m. This will see significant improvements to around 45% of our homes, benefiting around 22,000 Service families.</p>

<p>However, we realise more needs to be done. <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is therefore planning to invest £73-million this year on replacement windows, doors, roofs and upgrades to thermal efficiency and ventilation to reduce the occurrence of damp and mould in homes.</p>

<p>We are also improving our process, through a Damp and Mould Action Plan, to provide a more proactive approach through earlier intervention and prevention. From April, there will be a dedicated hotline for families to report issues with damp and mould in their homes and we will communicate this new number to families as it goes live.</p>

<p>Together, these initiatives will make a big difference for thousands of military families.</p>

<h2>Looking after your <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> home</h2>

<p>You are responsible for keeping your home in a reasonable condition during the time you occupy <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>, and protecting it from damage. In addition, you need to take care of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changing domestic fuses and light bulbs</li>
  <li>taking precautions to prevent damage to the <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> by fire, frost, the bursting of water pipes and the blocking of drains</li>
  <li>clearing any sink or bath blockages</li>
  <li>routine testing and cleaning of smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms</li>
  <li>resetting of electrical trip switches due to faulty bulbs</li>
  <li>ensuring that all repairs are reported to the relevant maintenance helpdesk as they occur</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moving out</h2>

<p>Moving home can be a very busy and stressful time, so we want to make your move as easy and stress free for you and your family as possible.</p>

<p>Visit the Pinnacle website for details on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pinnacleservicefamilies.co.uk/moving-out/" rel="external">moving out</a> of the UK <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> home and arranging a pre move out appointment.</p>

<h3>Move out</h3>

<p>Your move out will be attended by a Pinnacle Housing Officer who will inspect your home to determine if it meets the agreed move out standard.</p>

<p>If the standard is not satisfactory and there are deficiencies or damages that are not considered to be fair wear and tear, or you have failed to clean the property properly, a charge will be raised by the Housing Officer.</p>

<p>An appropriate Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) action will be taken by the Pinnacle Home Services team to cease accommodation charges on that property from the date of your move out.</p>

<h3>Removal services</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://grms.agilitylogistics.com" rel="external" title="Agility Logistics Limited (Agility)">Agility Logistics Limited (Agility)</a> is the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> approved service provider for removals and is part of the Global Removal Management Services (<abbr title="Global Removal Management Services">GRMS</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Charges for damage and deficiencies for <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> and Substitute <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> recovery from pay</h2>

<p>When you move out of UK service family accommodation (<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>) or substitute service family accommodation (<abbr title="substitute service family accommodation">SSFA</abbr>), you may be liable for charges for damages or deficiencies that are not classed as fair wear and tear or because you have failed to prepare the property to the correct standard, for example cleanliness.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> can take these directly from the pay of serving personnel. Any payments taken depend on the size of the charge and individual monthly income (using <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> guidelines to ensure that deductions do not exceed a set limit of pay).</p>

<p>If you consider that you are not responsible for the charges, or part of them, for example that the damage is the result of fair wear and tear, you are able to dispute the charge raised using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/service-family-accomodation-disputed-charges">stage 1 disputed charges form</a>’.</p>

<p>Once the stage 1 dispute has been completed and formally closed, should you disagree with the charges raised and stage 1 decision, you may submit a stage 2 dispute to the appropriate <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Accommodation Manager responsible for the property using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/service-family-accomodation-disputed-charges">stage 2 disputed charges form</a>.</p>

<p>Full details on moving out of your <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> and recoveries from pay are available in:</p>

<p>If you believe that you will lose entitlement to <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> in the future, or find yourself in this situation, advice is available from a variety of sources.  As well as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/joint-service-housing-advice-office-jshao">Joint Service Housing Advice Office</a>, other sources of information and advice are: service charities; families federations; housing advice centres; and local authorities.</p>

<h2>Compensation</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> and its industry partners aim to provide the highest possible standard of service to those entitled Service personnel and their families who live in Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>) and Substitute Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="substitute service family accommodation">SSFA</abbr>) homes in the UK.</p>

<p>On occasion when those standards are not met through either significant defect(s) at move in and/or missed appointments, our industry partners will recognise this by paying compensation, through High Street vouchers only, to offset any inconvenience caused.</p>

<p>Full details about the scheme and how to claim are published on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pinnacleservicefamilies.co.uk/complaints/compensation-form/" rel="external">Pinnacle’s website</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr> challenges</h3>

<p><abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr> challenges are handled in 2 stages (and are separate from the <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> complaints process below).</p>

<p>If you wish to challenge or appeal against your charge as a result of the Combined Accommodation Assessment System (<abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr>) then the correct procedure is set out on the <abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr> challenges page on the Defence Intranet.</p>

<p>Please note: The Stage 2 complaint form highlighted below cannot  be used for <abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr> challenges.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> complaints</h3>

<p>Complaints are handled in 3 stages, with the aim of making sure that the majority can be fully investigated and promptly put right. If you are dissatisfied by the response at any stage, you will be given the opportunity to go to the next stage.</p>

<h3>Complaint submission timings</h3>

<p>To effectively deal with complaints, it is necessary for them to be considered as close as possible to the date of the matter arising. Therefore, complaints are to be submitted within the timings detailed below. Complaints submitted outside these timings will only be considered if there are clear extenuating circumstances, such as deployments, training etc. Accepting complaints outside of these timings will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stage 1 - Submission within 28 working days of the incident</li>
  <li>Stage 2 - Submission within 28 working days from receipt of the Stage 1 response</li>
  <li>Stage 3 - Submission within 28 working days from receipt of the Stage 2 response</li>
</ul>

<p>*If the complaint is related to a culmination of events/matters, then it should be submitted within 28 days of the last event.</p>

<p>Full information about <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> complaints can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-464-tri-service-accommodation-regulations-tsars">JSP 464: tri-service accommodation regulations (<abbr title="Tri-Service Accommodation Regulations">TSARs</abbr>) Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6</a></p>

<h3>Stage 1</h3>

<p>If you are dissatisfied with our service please call Pinnacle’s National Service Centre on 0800 031 8628 or visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pinnacleservicefamilies.co.uk/" rel="external">Pinnacle website</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have registered a complaint, a Pinnacle representative will contact you, and give you a reference number for your complaint. They will explain how the process works and keep you regularly updated on the progress of your complaint.</p>

<h3>Stage 2</h3>

<p>If your complaint has been formally closed at stage 1 and you are not satisfied with the response, you can then escalate your complaint to the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Customer Services Team. You can do this in 2 ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Interactive form: by completing the stage 2 complaint form, which for security reasons is only available on the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Intranet. To access the form, copy and paste the following URL into your browser address bar when logged on to the Defence Intranet: https://modgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/defnet/<abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr>/Documents/<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>-Stage2-Complaint-Form.pdf.</li>
</ol>

<p>2.Email: by emailing the <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> Customer Service Team setting out your stage 2 complaint so that you include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the stage 1 complaint reference number</li>
  <li>your name and telephone number</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> address relating to your complaint</li>
  <li>why you are not happy with the result of your stage 1 complaint</li>
  <li>what desired outcome or remedy you are seeking</li>
</ul>

Please send your email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:diordaccn-stage2noreply@mod.gov.uk">diordaccn-stage2noreply@mod.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>If you make a stage 2 complaint, <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> will have access to your stage 1 complaints details and records, so you do not need to re-submit the full details of your complaint.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> will acknowledge it within 3 working days and provide you with a reference number.  An investigation will then be carried out, however there is no standard response time due to the need to further investigate complaints that vary in nature and complexity.</p>

<h3>Stage 3</h3>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the response you receive at stage 1 and stage 2, you can escalate your complaint to the Accommodation Complaints Review Panel by writing to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:People-Accom-ACRP-Stage3@mod.gov.uk">People-Accom-ACRP-Stage3@mod.gov.uk</a> or</p>

<h2>UK <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> Customer Survey</h2>

<p>A monthly telephone survey of randomly selected customers is conducted by Opinion Research Service (<abbr title="Opinion Research Service">ORS</abbr>) on behalf of the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. The aim of the research is to help <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> better understand the views of service personnel and families living in UK service family accommodation (<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>) and substitute <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> (<abbr title="substitute service family accommodation">SSFA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Although customers do not have to take part, we encourage them to respond to this short survey as your opinions will be used to measure how <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> is performing and identify ways of making further improvements to the housing service that matter to you. Answers are treated in the strictest confidence and only used for research purposes.</p>

<p>If you have any queries about the survey, or would like to follow up a call, please phone <abbr title="Opinion Research Service">ORS</abbr> on 01792 535322. Please note that <abbr title="Opinion Research Service">ORS</abbr> only deal with <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> customer survey related issues.</p>

<p>The results of the survey are issued to key <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> accommodation stakeholders on a quarterly basis:

<h2>The Combined accommodation assessment system (<abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr>) for service homes</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr> for Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>) is the method of setting charges in the UK and overseas and replaces the 4 Tier Grading (4TG) System (except Germany). <abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr> is a fairer and less subjective system than the 4TG System, and ensures that charges for <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> are set in accordance with modern, nationally recognised standards (utilising the Department of Communities and Local Government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-decent-home-definition-and-guidance">Decent Homes Standard</a>. Where charges increase there will be transitional protection that will set a maximum cap for the increase in any single year.</p>

<p>The Combined Accommodation Assessment System (<abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr>) will be updated on 1 October 2020 to bring <abbr title="Combined Accommodation Assessment System">CAAS</abbr> charging in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales in line with England by introducing a location assessment based on access to local services. This step has been included in policy for England since 2016 and means that all Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>) in the UK will be charged using the same measure. This will deliver a fairer application of the UK Location Factor to all <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> across the UK. For more information please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/combined-accommodation-assessment-system-the-new-accommodation-charging-system-explained">Combined Accommodation Assessment System: the new accommodation charging system explained</a> page.</p>

<h2>Update on the installation of Electric Vehicle Charge Points (<abbr title="Electric Vehicle Charge Points">EVCP</abbr>) in <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Following a successful <abbr title="Electric Vehicle Charge Points">EVCP</abbr> installation pilot in the South East region, we are pleased to inform families that the scheme is now being rolled out nationwide.</p>

<p>Families whose <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> has off-road parking or a dedicated garage within its immediate vicinity will be eligible to have an individual <abbr title="Electric Vehicle Charge Points">EVCP</abbr> installed. Those that have registered for an <abbr title="Electric Vehicle Charge Points">EVCP</abbr> and whose <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> meet the eligibility criteria, will be contacted by Amey in the coming months to arrange for a survey and installation, where appropriate.</p>

<p>Subject to funding, estate-wide delivery of EVCPs is also being planned. Two estates – Woolwich and RAF Leeming – have been chosen for the initial delivery in late November, with other <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> estates also being considered. <abbr title="Defence Infrastructure Organisation">DIO</abbr> will write to <abbr title="service family accommodation">SFA</abbr> families where estate delivery is planned to give full details prior to any works commencing.</p>

<p>If you have, or are in the process of purchasing, an electric vehicle and have not yet requested a charging point please contact the National Service Centre, <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:hello@pinnacleservicefamilies.co.uk">hello@pinnacleservicefamilies.co.uk</a>, to register your interest. There are no costs to families for an <abbr title="Electric Vehicle Charge Points">EVCP</abbr> installation, and grant funding cannot be claimed.</p>

<p>Please note, if you install an <abbr title="Electric Vehicle Charge Points">EVCP</abbr> without requesting approval, you may incur charges when moving out.</p>

<p>Further detailed guidance on <abbr title="Electric Vehicle Charge Points">EVCP</abbr> installations: <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1061336/20211013_EVCP_Guidelines2.odt">Guidelines for Electric Vehicle Charge Point (<abbr title="Electric Vehicle Charge Points">EVCP</abbr>) Installation at Service Family Accommodation</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="OpenDocument Text document">ODT</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">9.64 KB</span>)</span></p>
