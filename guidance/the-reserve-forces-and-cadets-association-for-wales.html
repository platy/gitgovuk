<p>Copyright: Open Government License</p>

<p>Have you ever thought of becoming a cadet in one of Wales’ cadet units?  John Challenger, 17, explains why he thought it was so important to help keep the 2,300 sea cadets spread across North Wales and the North West together during the pandemic.</p>

<p>John said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I believe that many young people have struggled with mental health, feeling unable to balance school work, cadets and keeping in touch with family and friends. However, the sea cadets has been working hard to reduce these difficulties for staff and cadets by building up networks of support that stretch throughout the country and aim to help us all through this challenging time.</p>
