<p>This page tells you what to do if there’s a no-deal Brexit. It will be updated if anything changes, including if a deal is agreed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>
</div>

<p>The rules for what you must show on food labels will change if there’s a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>Some of the new rules will come into effect from exit day. For others, you’ll have longer to update your food labels.</p>

<p>These proposals are subject to agreement with devolved administrations and Parliamentary process. Defra will update this page if anything changes.</p>

<p>The UK government will have a 21-month transition period where possible for labelling changes for goods produced or imported and placed on the UK market after exit day.</p>

<p>Where a transition period is not possible (eg the EU organic logo), Defra will encourage a pragmatic approach to enforcement within the UK.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-export-food-products-to-the-eu--changes-required-from-exit-day">If you export food products to the EU – changes required from exit day</h2>
<p>The EU has issued <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/eu_food_law_en.pdf">guidance on labelling changes</a> that should be in place from exit day to export from the UK to their markets. You should get advice from your EU importing contact on the EU’s labelling requirements.</p>

<p>If an individual food product is placed on the EU market before exit day, it can continue to be sold, distributed or transferred in the EU without labelling changes. Food is considered placed on the EU market if it has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>held in the EU for the purpose of sale, including offering for sale or any other form of transfer, whether free of charge or not</li>
  <li>sold, distributed, or transferred by other forms to the EU</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="food-business-operator-fbo-address">Food business operator (<abbr title="Food business operator">FBO</abbr>) address</h3>
<p>If you’re exporting pre-packaged food and caseins sold from the UK to the EU, you must include an EU address for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/food-labelling-giving-food-information-to-consumers#show-the-name-and-address-of-the-food-business-operator"><abbr title="Food business operator">FBO</abbr></a> or EU importer on your packaging or food label.</p>

<h3 id="eu-organic-logo">EU organic logo</h3>
<p>You must not use the EU organics logo on any UK organic food or feed after Brexit day unless the EU recognises your UK control body as able to certify UK organic goods for the purpose of export to the EU or equivalency with the EU is agreed. Please contact your control body for up to date details.</p>

<p>If the EU recognises the UK as equivalent or recognises the UK control bodies as able to certify UK organic goods for the purpose of export to the EU before exit day, UK organic goods can enter the EU and continue to use the logo.</p>

<p>If the UK does not reach an equivalency deal with the EU, you cannot export organic food or feed from the UK to the EU.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your UK organic control body logo.</p>

<h3 id="eu-emblem">EU emblem</h3>
<p>You must not use the EU emblem on goods produced in the UK unless you have been authorised by the EU to do so.</p>

<h3 id="eu-health-and-identification-marks">EU health and identification marks</h3>
<p>If you export products of animal origin (<abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>) from the UK to the EU, you must replace the EU oval health and identification marks with <a rel="external" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/eu-exit-changes-to-health-and-identification-marks">new UK health and identification marks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="country-of-origin-labels">Country of origin labels</h3>
<p>After Brexit, UK food should not be labelled as origin ‘EU’.</p>

<p>From April 2020, the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient of a food must be stated on labels.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-produce-or-place-goods-on-the-uk-market-after-exit-day--changes-required-within-21-months-of-brexit">If you produce or place goods on the UK market after exit day – changes required within 21 months of Brexit</h2>

<p>There will be a transition period of 21 months for labelling changes for goods placed on the UK market after exit day.</p>

<h3 id="eu-health-and-identification-marks-1">EU health and identification marks</h3>
<p>You can continue to use the EU oval health and identification mark on products of animal origin (<abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>) produced and sold in the UK in the 21 month transition period.</p>

<p>After the transition period, you must use the <a rel="external" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/prepare-your-business-for-the-uk-leaving-the-eu#an-update-on-health-and-identification-marks">new UK health and identification marks</a> for <abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> to clearly show the UK product has been subjected to strict health and welfare checks.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/prepare-your-business-for-the-uk-leaving-the-eu">Food Standards Agency’s guidance on the new health and identification marks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="food-business-operator-fbo-address-1">Food business operator (<abbr title="Food business operator">FBO</abbr>) address</h3>
<p>You must include a UK address for the <abbr title="Food business operator">FBO</abbr> on pre-packaged food or caseins sold in the UK. If the <abbr title="Food business operator">FBO</abbr> is not in the UK, include the address of your importer bringing the food into the UK.</p>

<h3 id="eu-organic-logo-1">EU organic logo</h3>

<p>You must not use the EU organic logo on any UK organic products unless the EU recognises the UK as equivalent or your control body has been recognised by the EU as able to certify UK organic goods for the purpose of export to the EU. Please contact your control body for up to date details.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organic-certification-list-of-uk-approved-organic-control-bodies">approved UK organic control body</a> logo if you qualified to use it before Brexit.</p>

<h3 id="country-of-origin-for-mixed-foods-and-eggs">Country of origin for mixed foods and eggs</h3>
<p>You can continue to label all food with the specific country or countries of origin. You can label most food as EU origin if it’s from a member state. After exit day, food produced in the UK cannot be labelled as EU origin.</p>

<h3 id="minced-meat">Minced meat</h3>
<p>For minced meat (excluding beef and veal) made, for example, with meat from the UK and EU the origin would be labelled ‘UK and non-UK’.</p>

<h3 id="fruit-and-vegetables">Fruit and vegetables</h3>

<p>For mixes of UK fruit and vegetables, you must replace any references to the EU with UK on the label. For example, ‘a mix of EU and non-EU origin’ changes to ‘a mix of UK and non-UK origin’.</p>

<p>If you’re part of the Approved Trader Scheme, you must remove the EU emblem from your UK food labels. You can use the replacement UK label instead.</p>

<h3 id="blended-honeys-and-olive-oil">Blended honeys and olive oil</h3>
<p>If your honey or olive oil is a blend from different countries, you must list each country of origin on the label, or state ‘blend of [honeys/olive oils] from more than one country’ (or similar wording) on the label.</p>

<h3 id="beef-and-veal">Beef and veal</h3>
<p>If the animal your beef or veal came from was born, reared or slaughtered outside of the UK and EU, your label must state ‘Origin: non-UK’.</p>

<p>For beef from live animals imported to the UK where you do not know the origin country of the animal, you should replace ‘live import into the EC’ with ‘beef from a live import into the UK’ on the label.</p>

<h3 id="eggs">Eggs</h3>
<p>If you import eggs that are not produced under farming methods that meet <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eggs-trade-regulations">UK egg trade regulations</a> from non-EU countries, you should mark them as ‘Non-UK standard’ rather than ‘Non-EC standard’.</p>

<h3 id="geographical-indication-gi-logo">Geographical Indication (<abbr title="Geographical Indication">GI</abbr>) logo</h3>
<p>If you produce a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/protected-food-name-scheme-uk-registered-products"><abbr title="Geographical Indication">GI</abbr>-protected food or drink product</a> (except wine or spirits), you must use the relevant UK logo on any products for sale in the UK. Guidance on the UK schemes, including the new logos, will be released before exit day. If you produce <abbr title="Geographical Indication">GI</abbr>-protected wine or spirits, the logo use is optional.</p>

<p>The UK will set up its own <abbr title="Geographical Indication">GI</abbr> schemes if there’s a no-deal Brexit. You’ll have 3 years from the launch of the UK schemes to adopt the relevant UK logo on food and agricultural product packaging.</p>
