<p>This guidance applies to businesses in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) importing or moving:</p>

<ul>
  <li>live animals, animal products and high risk food or feed not of animal origin (<abbr title="high risk food or feed not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr>) from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>equines from Norway</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to follow different guidance if youâ€™re importing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-or-move-composite-products-from-the-eu-and-northern-ireland-to-great-britain" class="govuk-link">composite products from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Northern Ireland</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Check if your animal product import must come from an approved establishment</h2>

<p>Imports of the following animal products must come from an establishment that has been approved by the exporting country to trade with the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>high risk animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>germinal products</li>
  <li>products of animal origin (<abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>) under safeguard measures</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check if an establishment is approved on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> lists of approved establishments for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/animal-by-products/approved-establishments_en" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/live_animals/approved-establishments_en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">germplasm</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/biosafety/food_hygiene/eu_food_establishments_en">food</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each establishment will have an approval number.</p>

<p>You must pre-notify imports from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries, and certain countries in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system">Import of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System (<abbr title="Import of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System">IPAFFS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>Read more guidance on the requirements for different animal products in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-border-operating-model" class="govuk-link">Border Operating Model</a>.</p>

<h3>Importing from approved establishments in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>To import from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states, you need to manually enter details of the approved establishment in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Import of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System">IPAFFS</abbr></a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>On the â€˜Traders addressesâ€™ page, select â€˜Add a place of originâ€™, then select â€˜Create a new place of originâ€™.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the â€˜Place of origin nameâ€™ field, enter the full name of the exporting establishment, then its authorisation number. You can check the name against the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>â€™s lists of approved establishments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the â€˜Place of originâ€™ fields, enter the full address, telephone number, country and email address for the approved establishment where requested.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save these details. Then you can add the approved establishment to your pre-notification. 
Details will be saved to your address book so that you can use them again.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Importing from approved establishments in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, San Marino, Faroes or Greenland</h3>

<p>If there is no option on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Import of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System">IPAFFS</abbr></a> to select the approved establishment from a drop-down menu, you need to enter details manually following the same process as for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</p>

<h2>Check what documents you need</h2>

<p>Imports need to come with one or all of the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health certificate</li>
  <li>import licence</li>
  <li>commercial document</li>
</ul>

<p>Find out what documents you need for your animal or product from the <a rel="external" href="http://apha.defra.gov.uk/official-vets/Guidance/bip/iin/index.htm" class="govuk-link">Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) Vet Gateway</a>.</p>

<h3>Health certificate</h3>

<p>You need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/health-certificates-for-animal-and-animal-product-imports-to-great-britain">health certificate</a> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>most live animals, including equines</li>
  <li>germinal products (semen, ova and embryos)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> if theyâ€™re coming from an area with safeguard restrictions on it - check <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHAâ€™s</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://apha.defra.gov.uk/official-vets/guidance/bip/iin/animal-prod-hum-cons.htm">information notes on animal products for human consumption</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Requirements for health certificates for imports of live animals, animal products and <abbr title="high risk food or feed not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr> into Great Britain will be introduced in phases from October 2021 to March 2022.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#october-imports">1 October 2021</a></li>
  <li><a href="#january-imports" class="govuk-link">1 January 2022</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#march-imports">1 March 2022</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You must make sure the person youâ€™re importing from arranges the health certificate in their own country. The original certificate (not a copy) must travel with the consignment and they must give you an electronic copy to upload to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Import of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System">IPAFFS</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Health certificates for equines</h3>
<p>Exporters from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and Norway must ensure that all equines meet testing requirements, as well as isolation and residency rules.</p>

<h3>Tests for equines</h3>
<p>Some equines need testing for certain diseases before theyâ€™re imported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Norway to Great Britain.
Equines that are registered with one of the following do not need to be tested before theyâ€™re imported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-approved studbook</li>
  <li>a national branch of an international body for sporting or competition purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>All other equines require testing before theyâ€™re imported.</p>

<p>Your exporter must ensure that all unregistered equines are tested for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>equine infectious anaemia (within 30 days before travel)</li>
  <li>equine viral arteritis (within 21 days before travel for uncastrated male equines that are older than 180 days, unless they meet vaccination requirements)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isolation and residency requirements</h3>
<p>Your exporter must keep unregistered equines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on a holding in the country or a country with similar health status for 40 days prior to travel</li>
  <li>separated from other equines that do not have equivalent health status, for at least 30 days prior to travel</li>
</ul>

<p>Registered equines do not have to meet any isolation or residency requirements before theyâ€™re imported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Norway to Great Britain.</p>

<p>You should check that your exporter is aware of these new requirements.</p>

<h3>Health certificates for <abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>To import <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal#abp-categories-explained" class="govuk-link">category 1 or 2 <abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr></a> from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to Great Britain, you must get an authorisation document. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#customer-service-centres-csc" class="govuk-link">Contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> if youâ€™re not sure how to do this.</p>

<h3>Import licence</h3>

<p>Certain animals and animal products must have an import licence or authorisation to be imported into Great Britain.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries-general-licences-and-authorisations" class="govuk-link">list of general licences</a> to see if the licence you need already exists.</p>

<p>If it does, you do not need to apply for it but you must follow the conditions described in it (for example, it might need certain treatments or other documentation).</p>

<p>If the licence you need is not on the list, you might need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-products-and-pathogens-application-for-import-licence" class="govuk-link">apply for an import licence for animal pathogens and products</a>. Check with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#customer-service-centres-csc" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHAâ€™s</abbr> Centre for International Trade</a> first.</p>

<p>If you want to import rodents, lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas) and most exotic mammals, you must apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/live-animals-not-pet-dogs-cats-ferrets-application-for-import-licence">licence to import live animals excluding pet dogs, cats and ferrets</a>.</p>

<h3>Commercial document</h3>

<p>Make sure the person youâ€™re importing your goods from completes a commercial document. It must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of whatâ€™s in the consignment</li>
  <li>the name of the person who sent it</li>
  <li>the name of the person itâ€™s being sent to</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importing <abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr> and <abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You must use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Import of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System">IPAFFS</abbr></a> to pre-notify the arrival of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>high-risk <abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr> and category 3 processed animal protein (PAP)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> under safeguard measures (where a commodity code is available)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr> imports</h3>

<p><abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr> are in either <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal#abp-categories-explained">high risk or low risk categories</a>.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, you will not be able to import <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal#abp-categories-explained">category 1 and 2 <abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If your category 1 or category 2 <abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr> can be imported you must get pre-authorisation from Defra before any imports take place.</p>

<p><abbr title="animal by-products">ABP</abbr> must be accompanied by a commercial document when you import them from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">Contact the Animal Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>)</a> if youâ€™re unsure whether you need a commercial document.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> under safeguard measures imports</h3>

<p><abbr title="products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> which are under safeguard measures must be accompanied by a health certificate.</p>

<p>When you submit your import notification onto <abbr title="Import of Products, Animals, Food and Feed System">IPAFFS</abbr>, youâ€™ll get a unique notification number (UNN) for the product. The format of this number will be IMP.<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>.2021.1XXXXXX.</p>

<h2>Check if you need to notify <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system">notify <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> if you plan to import live animals that do not need a health certificate or official documentation, but do have to be notified under Trade in Animals and Related Products regulations (TARP). For example, insects, reptiles and amphibians.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re importing to Northern Ireland, contact <a href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr></a> for advice about what you need to do.</p>

<h2>When your consignment arrives</h2>

<p>Animals must be taken directly to the destination premises listed in the documentation. Depending on the species imported, animals may need to stay at the destination premises for 48 hours.</p>

<p>Consignments may need a post-import check. <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will contact you to arrange a visit if they do.</p>

<h2>Documents to transport live animals from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to Great Britain</h2>

<p>To transport live animals from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to Great Britain, or to Northern Ireland via Great Britain, transporters must apply for the following documents issued by Great Britain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transporter authorisation</li>
  <li>certificate of competence</li>
  <li>vehicle approval certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>Great Britain does not accept <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-issued versions of these documents. You can use <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> versions in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>Journey logs</h3>

<p>You must apply for 2 journey logs for live animal movements from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to, or through, Great Britain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one approved by <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>one approved by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state of origin</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CITCarlisle@apha.gov.uk">CITCarlisle@apha.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Documents to transport live animals from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h2>

<h3>Moving equines from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h3>
<p>To move horses and other equines from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/horse-passport/import-or-export-a-horse-or-related-animal">check the exporter has the correct equine identification (ID)</a>.</p>

<p>If the equine is going to return to Northern Ireland, the exporter must also have appropriate documentation that shows the date that the equine left Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>Transiting live animals through Great Britain</h2>

<p>Read guidance about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transiting-animals-and-animal-products-through-great-britain" class="govuk-link">moving food containing animal products from one third country to another third country and transiting <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr></a>, known as â€˜landbridgeâ€™ movements.</p>

<h2>Animal welfare when importing live animals</h2>

<p>You must make sure you meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-welfare#animal-welfare-during-transport">animal welfare standards</a> when importing live animals.</p>

<h2>Imports from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>There will be no changes to the way live animals, animal products and <abbr title="high risk food or feed not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr> are imported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> into Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>Movements from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h2>
<p>You can move animals, animal products and <abbr title="high risk food or feed not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr> from  Northern Ireland to Great Britain if they are qualifying Northern Ireland goods.</p>

<p>Qualifying Northern Ireland goods are goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in free circulation in Northern Ireland - which means they are not under customs supervision (except when that supervision arises from the goods being taken out of Northern Ireland or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</li>
  <li>which have undergone processing operations in Northern Ireland under the inward processing procedure, and only incorporate inputs which were in free circulation in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>These arrangements will not apply to goods covered by specific rules such as Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).</p>
