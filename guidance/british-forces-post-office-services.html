<h2>Announcements</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>From the 4 April, BFPO stamp prices, weight and size limits will change.
The poster below provides the new prices coming into effect from April and the new size restrictions for mail items posted via a Post Office Counter.</p>

<p><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1060790/20220309_Stamp_Price_Increase-BFPO_Poster__Final_.pdf">BFPO Stamp Price Poster</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">223 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">1 page</span>)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>BFPO Customers are reminded that from <strong>4 May 2021</strong>, BFPO will no longer be accepting mail items intended for export to overseas BFPO locations, which do not comply with current International Mail Import/Export Regulations.  These mail items will either be refused at point of direct delivery at BFPO Northolt site or returned at the first opportunity back into the Royal Mail system. Please note, BFPO do not offer a guaranteed timed service and hold no liability for items which are perishable, out of date or unusable at the point of receipt.</p>
</div>

<p>Family and friends of UK defence personnel and their dependants serving overseas, who post private mail items via UK Post Office Counters should note, that you should always be required to complete a customs declaration for private parcels destined for <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> addresses overseas.  Completion of customs declaration forms should be as accurate as possible and must include as a bare minimum, all contents, value and a valid signature.  These details are important to ensure local customs authorities in the country of destination can assess your parcel contents and clear items for delivery as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> continue to thank all customers for their patience, support and understanding and rest assured <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> are working tirelessly to get back to business as usual, as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>2021 Importing and Exporting Regulations</h3>

<p>Changes to UK and international law will affect how mail and parcels will be cleared in the future and these new laws, which are driven by aviation security and fiscal requirements, will be getting much stricter throughout 2021. These changes start to be introduced as the UK/<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> transition period ends and from 1 January 2021, parcels posted to/from <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> customers located in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/UK will require either a Royal Mail Customs Notification 22 (CN22), Customs Notification 23 (CN23) or Parcelforce Customs Pack (CP72) and Electronic Customs Data (ECD).  Please note, that it is the senders responsibility to ensure that the new regulations are followed and failure to comply could result in items being seized and subjected to additional VAT/clearance charges prior to release by local customs authorities.  In extreme cases, it could also lead to your parcels being returned or destroyed.</p>

<h3>Ordering Online Goods for <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Overseas Addresses (including the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</h3>

<p>New customs declaration procedures (CN22/CN23/CP72/ECD) will need to be completed by the seller/sender for products destined for overseas <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> locations. Ordering/sending customers should have the opportunity to either pay VAT/clearance charges (if applicable) up front or opt for these charges to be paid by the recipient under local country arrangements. Additionally, from March 2021, there will be a requirement to supply ICS2 <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs pre-arrival data which will be linked to your parcel and new mail VAT processes are scheduled for introduction in July.  Further <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> announcements will follow.</p>

<h3>Posting Items at a Post Office Counter</h3>

<p>When sending items to overseas <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> addresses, you will be required to complete customs declarations forms in more detail than before, and in particular ensuring that exact contents and value are shown.  Your local Post Office Counter staff will be able to take you through this process.</p>

<h3>Customer Responsibility</h3>

<p>Please note, that <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, who act solely as the shipping agent, have no responsibility or influence in customs matters and this responsibility rests with the sender or the selling/sending company.</p>

<h3>Age verification knives and blades</h3>

<p>The Offensive Weapons Act 2019 (<abbr title="Offensive Weapons Act">OWA</abbr>) prohibits the online sale and delivery of blades to people under 18 years of age. Under the <abbr title="Offensive Weapons Act">OWA</abbr>, both the vendor and the courier company will, in certain circumstances, be criminally liable if bladed items are delivered into the hands of an individual who is under 18 years old.</p>

<p>Customers should note the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Parcelforce  Age Verification Service is not available to <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> customers. Further details can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.parcelforce.com/age-verification-terms#_bookmark1" rel="external">Parcelforce website</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Royal Mail has updated its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/96/~/prohibited-and-restricted-items---advice-for-personal-customers" rel="external">prohibited and restricted advice to customers</a> and has added Age Verification items to the prohibited list for <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to these prohibitions bladed products can no longer be sent to or from a <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> address.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>International driving licences</h3>

<p>For enquiries about International Driving Licences, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prepare-to-drive-in-the-eu-after-brexit">visit the DVLA website</a>.</p>

<h3>Advice for customers buying goods by mail order and online</h3>

<p><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> has become aware that some customers based overseas are purchasing valuable items without ensuring that adequate compensation (insurance cover) for the item has been purchased at the same time.</p>

<p>Please note that it is entirely the customer’s responsibility to ensure that an item has adequate compensation cover when purchasing items that will be sent through the postal and <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> system.</p>

<p>If the company will not offer additional compensation cover for your item, we advise  careful  consideration  before placing an order with them and that you give further consideration to purchasing instead from a company that does.</p>

<p>It is especially important to ensure that items are adequately insured when buying from small marketplace sellers (for example, EBay, Gumtree, Spock ).</p>

<p>It’s worth remembering that couriers used to deliver goods will not know the value of your parcel and will not allow for additional compensation unless the individual or seller requests this. You should check with the supplier that they are using a service that offers the right level of compensation for your purchase.</p>

<p>As the individual placing your order, it is your responsibility to make sure your purchase is adequately covered should loss or damage occur.</p>

<p>Please note that <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> cannot pay full compensation for damage or loss should your item not be covered for its full value. We strongly recommend using Royal Mail Special Delivery for expensive purchases, which offers several levels of compensation and comes with a full track and trace capability.</p>

<p>See full details in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/british-forces-post-office-services#bfpo-customer-services">Customer Service</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/british-forces-post-office-services#compensation-services">Compensation</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/british-forces-post-office-services#commercial-mail">Commercial Mail Service</a> sections.</p>

<h3>Christmas 2021 – Mail Services Update:</h3>

<p>As we have progressed through 2021, <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> has seen a general improvement to mail services across our network, however there are still some locations (specifically Naples, Nepal &amp; Brunei) where services remain inconsistent or restricted.  <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> customers in those locations should be assured that <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> will continue to seek all possible service improvements as a priority.</p>

<p>It is important that all <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> customers understand that UK/international logistic supply chains (this includes world-wide mail pipelines) are likely to remain under significant pressure for the remainder of the year, at least, which could further impact service frequencies. <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> customers can be assured that throughout the run up to Christmas, that <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> will continue to exploit every opportunity to move mail forward in support of the overseas defence community, however due to the ongoing uncertainty, at this time, <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> customers are strongly advised to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Post mail items and place mail orders as early as possible – <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> overseas customers are also advised to pass this message to family and friends, to avoid disappointment should the world-wide mail pipeline become further disrupted in the run up to Christmas 2021.</li>
  <li>All mail items posted to a <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> address must have a customs declaration form attached which is mandated as part of International mail import/export regulation.</li>
  <li>It is also very important that customers ensure that items have a full return address, as items received at <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt which do not have a customs declaration attached will be returned to sender.  Non-complaint items received without a return address may be disposed of as ‘undeliverable’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Customers are also reminded that <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not offer a guaranteed timed service and hold no liability for items which are perishable, out of date or unusable at the point of receipt.</li>
  <li>Are unable to advise customers regarding mail import/export tax regulation.</li>
  <li>Are unable to influence local customs process.</li>
  <li>Hold no liability for return/disposal of non-compliant mail items received without customs declarations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> customer services</h2>

<p>Whilst the vast majority of customers will receive an excellent service and customer experience occasionally things go wrong and mail becomes lost or damaged.</p>

<p>To minimise the risk customers are advised to ensure the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>use the correct full address, include the unit and sub unit, <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> receives many letters and parcels with only a name and <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> number; it may be impossible to locate the correct recipient especially in larger garrisons without the unit details; ensure that third parties have the full address and use it especially when internet shopping with commercial companies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> mail may endure a long journey to reach its destination especially in remote areas of the world and mail may pass through several organisations for example, airport cargo handlers and foreign mail administrations; senders of mail should use good quality packaging sufficient to withstand rough handling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the main cause of damage to contents is when the tops of plastic containers open in transit covering contents in liquid or gel. The main cause of this is shower gels. <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> has to deal with several of these daily. Customers are advised to send these with screw caps or if not feasible secure the cap with adhesive tape to prevent opening in transit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include the senders address preferably on the reverse in order that the mail can be returned if we are unable to deliver it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your mail has not arrived within 30 working days then initially:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>at a <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Location contact the Forces Post Office staff who will advise what course of action to take and assist with compiling claim forms, ensuring that the necessary evidence is attached to the claims form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the UK collect a claim form from your local Post Office and once complete ensure that the necessary evidence is attached to the claims form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>normally the sender of the mail should initiate claims for lost mail and the recipient for damaged mail</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for goods purchased from commercial companies (mail order/on-line shopping) the commercial company holds the contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> and has to initiate the claims procedure; customers must contact the company to initiate the process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure you have the correct amount of compensation for the value of the goods being sent, basic cover included in the postage cost is for Royal Mail a maximum of £20 per mail item and Parcelforce £100 per mail item; if your goods are valued in excess of these amounts purchase the extra compensation or you will not recover the full cost.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Compensation services</h2>

Compensation up to a maximum of £20 may be paid where it can be shown that a letter was damaged or lost while in the custody of either Royal Mail or the British Forces Postal Service.

<h2>Online postage</h2>

<p>Customers are reminded that the Royal Mail online postage services including Click and Drop are not available from a <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> location to the UK or international destinations. Online postage is a UK-only service and <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> cannot support/offer this service. Acceptance of these items into the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> system does not allow us to provide an assured service to the customer in respect of delivery timelines, proof of postage, tracking and potentially compensation in the event of non-delivery.</p>

<p>Customers should also note that <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> will not facilitate any claims for loss or damage for items which are wrongly accepted by unit postal staff in Limited Service locations and overseas Forces Post Office staff have been instructed not to accept these items.</p>

<h2>Commercial mail</h2>

<p>Commercial mail is mailed items that are sent through the HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> mail system by a UK based commercial operator in response to an order placed by an authorised individual.</p>

<h3>Ordering goods through the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Mail system</h3>

<p>The following individuals can use the system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>British forces personnel</li>
  <li>entitled civilians</li>
  <li>dependants of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>These ‘end customers’ based at a <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> address, can arrange to receive goods via a UK based Commercial Operator, which is categorised by <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> (the Authority) as ‘Commercial Mail’ (also known as ‘Commercial Receipts’). Family and friends (living in the UK) of the above can also arrange for ‘Commercial Mail’ to be received by end customers. For example, end customers based at a <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> address, or family and friends (living in the UK), will directly contact a mail order or catalogue company, possibly via the Internet, to place an order for goods for delivery to a <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> address.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bfpo-commercial-contracts-list" title="Read the Commercial Contracts list">commercial contracts list</a> of companies already in direct contract with HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> under the ‘Commercial Mail’ process.</p>

<p>All potential users of the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Mail system are strongly advised to read both the disclaimer and additional information.</p>

<p>Disclaimer:</p>

<p>The Authority does not endorse any company that appears on the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Contracts List, in any way whatsoever, including any product(s) or service(s) they offer.</p>

<p>Individuals who make use of these companies do so entirely at their own risk.</p>

<p>Individuals are to be aware that there may be other companies, not appearing on the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Contracts List, who may be able to offer the same, or similar product(s) or service(s).</p>

<p>Should you choose to order from a company not appearing on the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Contracts List, they will be required to adhere to one of the following processes;</p>

<p>Once a company has received an order from an Authorised Individual, they can despatch articles of Commercial Mail to End Customers at worldwide <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> locations, via the HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt Commercial Mail (<abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr>) System, by following one of the four following options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Companies who foresee a potential ‘one off’, or infrequent use of the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> System can either;</li>
</ol>

<p>a. Physically post the article at a Post Office and pay the appropriate (<abbr title="Her Majesty's">HM</abbr> forces) postage rate (note: using either Royal Mail documentation (CN22/23) or ParcelForce Worldwide PFU 509 despatch pack). Payment for this method allows for both the shipment to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and the onward shipment to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, or any extra costs incurred.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b. Use the arrangement <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> has with Parcelforce Worldwide*, named the ‘One Stop Shop’ Process. Under this process, Companies contract directly with ParcelForce Worldwide (see below for contact details), who, in turn,  are in direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>. Payment for this method also allows for both the shipment to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and the onward shipment to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, or any extra costs incurred.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Many Companies are already in direct contract with ParcelForce for collections of goods direct from their premises for addresses in the UK mainland only. This does not allow for the correct documentation or onward shipment (and extra cost) for despatch from HQ BFPO Northolt to the BFPO End Customer. We recommend that you speak to your Parcelforce representative for further information.</p>
</div>

<p>or</p>

<p>c. Use any <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> may have with other Courier Companies who have chosen to be in direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>. Under this process, companies contract directly with the courier company on the list who, in turn, is in direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>. Payment for this method is made direct to the courier company, who are themselves invoiced by <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>. This allows for both the shipment to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and the onward shipment to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> End Customer, with no additional requirement for a direct <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, or any extra costs incurred.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Companies who foresee potential frequent use of the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> System enter into a <abbr title="Commercial Mail">CM</abbr> Contract directly with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial (see below for contact details), for the onward shipment by <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> to the <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> End Customer, with prior use of either your company’s own transport or a carrier of your company’s choice for the inland journey to deliver articles to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<p>All potential users of the HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Mail System must read the rules on mail prohibitions and restrictions.</p>

<p>Adhere without exclusion to the weight and size restrictions that apply to ‘Commercial Mail’.</p>

<p>Note that articles outside of these maximum weight and size restrictions will be refused upon entry at the HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Mail reception desk.</p>

<p>Note that Purchase Order numbers cannot be accommodated under the electronic Invoicing process that supports the automated <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Commercial Mail System and will therefore not appear on any invoice issued by the Defence Business Service, Liverpool</p>

<p>Note that HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> will not enter into any compensation arrangements with, or make any direct compensation payments to, any third party who use a company that is itself already in direct Commercial Mail Contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> to despatch their articles to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and beyond, to end <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> addresses overseas. <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>’s responsibility and authority remains within the Commercial Mail Contract with the Company in possession of a Commercial Mail Contract with HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> only. Any arrangement between the third party and the company in possession of a ‘Commercial Mail’ contract with <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, regarding the despatch of the third party’s articles to HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> Northolt and beyond, is entirely the concern of those two parties only. HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> bears no responsibility, authority or commitment in that relationship, as its contractual relationship is with the Company in possession of a ‘Commercial Mail’ Contract with HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> only</p>

<p>Note that <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> offers a very limited service for items destined for 5000 series <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> numbers, one that does not offer any delivery guarantees or compensation coverage. This is due to the fact that once items have reached HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> for processing, they are then passed to a separate, 3rd party for subsequent processing and distribution, who operate very strict controls on mail volume allocations and types of items allowed. This places the items totally outside of <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>’s control, therefore no assurance as to final delivery timeframes can be given and <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> does not accept liability for compensation in the event of any item(s) going missing. Should the 3rd party, for whatever reason, refuse to accept any item upon presentation by HQ <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, then the Sender shall be notified by <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> and be responsible for its collection from <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr>, or, <abbr title="British Forces Post Office">BFPO</abbr> will return the item back to the sender, at the senders cost (the 3rd party, responsible for onward processing and distribution, may be contacted on 01908 852222 - Option 3).</p>
