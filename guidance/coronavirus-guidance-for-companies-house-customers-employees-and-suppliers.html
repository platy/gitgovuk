<h2>Upload a document to Companies House</h2>

<p>We’ve developed a service to <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/efs-submission/start" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Upload a document to Companies House</a> instead of sending a paper document by post.</p>

<p>It also includes features such as acknowledgments and online payment using GOV.UK Pay. We’re continually working to improve this service and include more document types.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>This service is not available for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/filing-your-companies-house-information-online#wf-forms" class="govuk-link">Companies House documents you can already send to us online</a>.</p>

<h2>How to get the company authentication code</h2>

<p>You can request to have your code sent to your <a class="govuk-link" href="#home-address">home address</a> or your <a href="#office-address" class="govuk-link">registered office address</a>.</p>

<h3>Send to a home address</h3>

<p>If you are unable to access your company’s registered office address, you can <a rel="external" href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/auth-code-requests/start" class="govuk-link">request to have your authentication code sent to your home address instead</a>.</p>

<p>This is a temporary service in response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<h3>Send to a registered office address</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a href="https://ewf.companieshouse.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Request your code now</a>. It’s sent by post to your company’s registered office and can take up to 5 days to arrive.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://bit.ly/2ZBFM6z">Watch our video</a> to see how easy it is to register and order your code.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re new to the service, you’ll need to:</p>

<h2>More time to file accounts and other information</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/corporate-insolvency-and-governance-bill-receives-royal-assent" class="govuk-link">The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 received royal assent on 25 June 2020</a>. The Act granted automatic extensions for filing deadlines between 27 June 2020 and 5 April 2021 to relieve the burden on companies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and allow them to focus all their efforts on continuing to operate. Automatic extensions were granted for accounts, confirmation statements, event-driven filings and mortgage charges.</p>

<p>There will be no further automatic extensions for confirmation statement filings, accounts filings and event-driven filings after 5 April 2021. Any deadlines that fall after this date will revert to normal.</p>

<p>For mortgage charges created up to and including 4 April 2021, those with an interest in the charge will continue to receive an automatic extension of 10 additional days to file the particulars of a charge (31 days). Mortgage charges created after 4 April 2021 will not receive an automatic extension, and those with an interest in the charge will need to file within 21 days as normal. The 21-day period starts the day after the charge was created.</p>

<h3>If you need more time to file your accounts</h3>
<p>For accounts filing deadlines that fall after 5 April, companies can still <a rel="external" href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/extensions" class="govuk-link">apply for a 3-month extension</a>.</p>

<p>Companies that are eligible and cite issues around COVID-19 in their application will be granted an extension.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" role="note" aria-label="Warning">
<p>Companies that have already had their accounts deadline extended may not be eligible, as the law only allows a maximum filing period of 12 months.</p>
</div>

<p>It’s important to check if you’re eligible for an extension and to apply for an extension before your deadline. You must file your accounts on time or you’ll receive a late filing penalty.</p>

<p><a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Check your filing deadlines on Companies House service (CHS)</a>. The deadlines on CHS are up to date, so you do not need to contact us to find out when your filing deadline is.</p>

<h2>Strike off (dissolution)</h2>

<p>Following a temporary pause, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/companies-house-to-resume-voluntary-and-compulsory-strike-off" class="govuk-link">we’ve resumed our strike off processes from 8 March 2021</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to write to companies who are late filing their annual accounts or confirmation statement and help them bring their record up to date.</p>

<p>We understand that this is a difficult time and we’re committed to supporting businesses who may be struggling with their filing requirements during the coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<h2>Late filing penalties</h2>
<p>If you do not apply for an extension before your filing deadline, and your accounts have been filed late, an automatic penalty will be imposed. The registrar has very limited discretion to not collect a penalty.</p>

<p>For a temporary period, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a break for companies to pay late filing penalties</li>
  <li>provide additional support with payment plans for late filing penalties</li>
</ul>

<h3>Paying your penalty</h3>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/late-filing-penalties#paying-your-penalty">pay your penalty by BACS</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>We’re not able to take credit card payments over the telephone.</p>
</div>

<h3>LFP appeals</h3>

<p>Each appeal is treated on a case-by-case basis, and we already have policies in place to deal with appeals based upon unforeseen poor health. We’ll consider appeals based upon coronavirus under these policies.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/appeal-a-penalty/">appeal your late filing penalty online</a>.</p>

<p>See our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/late-filing-penalties" class="govuk-link">late filing penalties and appeals</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Contacting Companies House</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-companies-house" class="govuk-link">contact Companies House</a> as usual from Monday to Friday, 8.30am to 6pm.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>Do not send paper correspondence or documents by post unless it’s absolutely necessary.</p>
</div>

<p>Email <a href="mailto:enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">enquiries@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> and we’ll answer as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Access to our offices</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house/about/access-and-opening" class="govuk-link">Our offices</a> are closed to the public until further notice. The delivery of paper documents is restricted.</p>

<p>It’s taking much longer than usual to process paper forms. <a class="govuk-link" href="#file-online">Use our online services</a> to update your information as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>Repurchase of shares (SH03) and schemes of arrangement</h2>
<p>HMRC has introduced an electronic service to temporarily replace their usual Stamp Duty process.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pay-stamp-duty">How to pay Stamp Duty</a> and more information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/stamp-duty-on-shares" class="govuk-link">Stamp Duty on shares</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notify-a-purchase-of-own-shares">SH03 form</a> is normally sent to HMRC for stamping if the purchase is above the duty payable threshold. You’ll still need to send your form to HMRC - they will issue your company with a letter instead of stamping the form.</p>

<p>Companies House will accept and register an unstamped SH03 form if it’s accompanied by the letter from HMRC confirming that the correct duty has been paid.</p>

<p>We will also accept and register court orders sanctioning <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/stamp-duty-and-stamp-duty-reserve-tax-transfer-schemes-of-arrangement" class="govuk-link">schemes of arrangement</a> which are accompanied by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the letter from HMRC confirming that the correct duty has been paid</li>
  <li>a letter from HMRC confirming that no duty is payable</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The letter will not appear on the public register.</p>
</div>

<h2>Same day services</h2>
<p>We have suspended all our same day services until further notice.</p>

<h2>Secure and suppression applications</h2>

<h3>Removing your home address from the public register (SR01)</h3>
<p>To register your application as quickly as possible, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay the correct fee online</li>
  <li>email your completed form and payment reference to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DSR@companieshouse.gov.uk">DSR@companieshouse.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-to-remove-your-home-address-from-the-public-register-sr01" class="govuk-link">form SR01</a> for full instructions on how to complete your application.</p>
</div>

<p>You can still send your application by post with a cheque or postal order - but there may be a delay.</p>

<h3>Restricting the disclosure of your information</h3>

<p>So we can protect your details as quickly as possible, you must <a rel="external" href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/protect-your-details/start" class="govuk-link">apply online to protect your details from being disclosed on the Companies House public register</a>.</p>

<p>For more information, see our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricting-the-disclosure-of-your-psc-information">restricting the disclosure of your information</a>.</p>

<h2>Suppliers</h2>

<p>Do not send us paper invoices by post. It’s taking much longer than usual to process paper documents.</p>

<p>Email your PDF invoices to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accountspayable@companieshouse.gov.uk">accountspayable@companieshouse.gov.uk</a> - this will help us process your invoices as quickly as possible.</p>
