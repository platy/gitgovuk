<h2>If you were living in Norway before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Norway since before 1 January 2021. You should read this in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for information about citizensâ€™ rights under the UK â€“ European Economic Area European Free Trade Association (EEA EFTA) Separation Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Norwegian government and your local authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/norway">Norway travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Norway read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/norway/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/norway/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Norway</a>.</p>

<p>You must register your intention to live in Norway with the <a href="https://www.udi.no/en/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Norwegian Immigration Directorate</a> (UDI) and apply for a residence permit (â€˜oppholdstillatelseâ€™).</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/foreign/you-must-notify-us-when-you-move/moving-to-norway/">Norwegian Tax Administrationâ€™s guidance</a> on how to register.</p>

<h3>Norwegian ID number</h3>

<p>Everyone on the Norwegian National Population Registry (Folkeregisteret) is assigned a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/foreign/norwegian-identification-number/national-identity-number/" rel="external">national identity number</a>. This is an 11-digit personal identifier. The last 5 digits are called a â€˜personal numberâ€™.</p>

<p>Many public and private sector organisations require you to have a Norwegian identity number so you can access their services. You need it to open a bank account, register with a GP (fastlege), and pay taxes.</p>

<p>Use the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/foreign/you-must-notify-us-when-you-move/moving-to-norway/?277269=311302">National Population Registry checker to see if you need to notify them when you move to Norway</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Norway before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you applied for your new residence card (oppholdskort) by 31 December 2021, your rights are protected by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eea-efta-separation-agreement" class="govuk-link">UK â€“ EEA EFTA Separation Agreement</a> pending a decision on your application. You should continue and complete the process to get your new residence card as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Dual UK-Norwegian nationals do not need to apply for a residence card.</p>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-renew/replace-your-residence-card-or-the-sticker-in-your-passport-/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">renew your residence card (oppholdskort)</a> when it expires.</p>

<p>If you have not had a response to your residence card (oppholdskort) application, <a href="https://www.udi.no/en/contact-us/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">contact UDI</a> and provide your application reference number if you have one.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>

<p>If your application is refused, you will be notified about the appeal process. Read the Norwegian government advice on <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/word-definitions/appealing-a-decision/#link-1009" class="govuk-link">how to appeal a residency decision</a>. You do not qualify for legal aid in Norway if you are appealing a decision relating to the UK-EEA EFTA Separation Agreement.</p>

<p>If your appeal is unsuccessful, you must either apply for another residence permit or leave Norway by the deadline that the UDI gives you.</p>

<p>If you are not eligible to apply for residence under the UK-EEA EFTA Separation Agreement, you may be able to apply for residence as a third country national on other grounds. You should <a href="https://www.udi.no/en/contact-us/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">contact UDI for more information about alternative residence permits</a>.</p>

<h3>Late applications</h3>

<p>The deadline for applying for a new residence status was 31 December 2021. You can still apply if you have reasonable grounds for missing it. Applications will be considered on an individual basis. You should apply as soon as possible. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/contact-us/">Contact UDI</a> to find out how to apply.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Norway at any point in the future. Find more information on who this applies to in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">Living in Europe guidance</a>. Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/residence-according-to-the-brexit-regulations/brexit-will-apply-from-abroad/" class="govuk-link">Norwegian government guidance on how to apply as a family member</a>.</p>

<p>Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Norwegian authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-norway#coronavirus" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Norway.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Norway</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/norway/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Norwegian travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or EFTA country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Norway using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Norway with a Norwegian residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Norway, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Norway before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your residence card (oppholdskort) or frontier worker permit issued under the UK-EEA EFTA Separation Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence card, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Until you receive your new residence card, you should show one of the approved documents to prove that you are a resident in Norway. This can be the application receipt or:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receipt for registration under the registration scheme for EEA nationals, dated before 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>certificate of application under sections 19-33 to 19-35 of the Immigration Regulations</li>
  <li>registration certificate or proof of permanent residence issued under the registration scheme for EEA nationals</li>
  <li>residence certificate from the National Population Register (bostedsattest)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can order residence certificates from the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/national-registry/certificates-and-information/order-certificates/overview-of-certificates/bostedsattest/">Norwegian Tax Administration</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are resident in Norway, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the UK-EEA EFTA Separation Agreement, you can enter and exit Norway with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-norway" class="govuk-link">healthcare in Norway</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>

<p>People employed and self-employed in Norway make contributions to the Norway National Insurance Scheme (folketrygden) which entitles them to access healthcare in Norway on the same basis as a Norwegian citizen. In Norway everyone must pay fees when accessing healthcare.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.helsenorge.no/en/foreigners-in-norway/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Norwegian government guidance on health rights for foreigners in Norway</a>.</p>
