<p>Claims for the third SEISS grant have now closed.</p>

<p>The last date for making a claim for the third grant was 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to claims made during the third grant period.</p>

<p>Details about the fourth grant will be announced on 3 March 2021.</p>
</div>

<p>The scheme has been extended. If you were not eligible for the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20201020152009/https:/www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme">first and second grant</a> based on the information in your Self Assessment tax returns, you will not be eligible for the third.</p>

<p>HMRC expects you to make an honest assessment about whether you reasonably believe your business will have a significant reduction in profits.</p>

<p>To make a claim for the third grant your business must have had a new or continuing impact from coronavirus between 1 November 2020 and 29 January 2021, which you reasonably believe will have a significant reduction in your profits.</p>

<p>The third taxable grant is worth 80% of your average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total.</p>

<p>The grant does not need to be repaid if you’re eligible, but will be subject to Income Tax and self-employed National Insurance and must be reported on your 2020 to 2021 Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#recordstokeep" class="govuk-link">keep evidence</a> to support your claim.</p>

<p>Grants under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme are not counted as ‘access to public funds’, and you can claim the grant on all categories of work visa.</p>

<p>You can follow these steps to help you understand what you can do now.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<h2>Who can claim</h2>

<p>To be eligible for the third grant you must be a self-employed individual or a member of a partnership. You cannot claim the grant if you trade through a limited company or a trust.</p>

<p>If you claim Maternity Allowance this will not affect your eligibility for the grant.</p>

<p>You must have traded in both tax years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2018 to 2019 and submitted your Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year</li>
  <li>2019 to 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>You must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be currently trading but are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#impactedbyrd">impacted by reduced demand</a> due to coronavirus</li>
  <li>have been trading but are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#tempunable" class="govuk-link">temporarily unable to do so</a> due to coronavirus</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also declare that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you intend to continue to trade</li>
  <li>you reasonably believe there will be a significant reduction in your trading profits</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reasonable belief</h3>

<p>In order to claim, you must reasonably believe that you will suffer a significant reduction in trading profits due to reduced business activity, capacity, demand or inability to trade due to coronavirus during 1 November 2020 to 29 January 2021. You must keep evidence that shows how your business has been impacted by coronavirus resulting in less business activity than otherwise expected.</p>

<h3>Significant reduction</h3>

<p>Before you make a claim, you must decide if the impact on your business will cause a significant reduction in your trading profits for the tax year you report them in.</p>

<p>HMRC cannot make this decision for you because your individual and wider business circumstances will need to be considered when deciding whether the reduction is significant.</p>

<p>You should wait until you have a reasonable belief that your trading profits are going to be significantly reduced, before you make your claim.</p>

<p>You do not have to consider any other coronavirus scheme support payments you have already received when deciding whether you reasonably believe that you will suffer a significant reduction in trading profits due to reduced activity, capacity, demand or inability to trade due to coronavirus during 1 November 2020 to 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>There are some <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-your-trading-conditions-affect-your-eligibility-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#examples" class="govuk-link">examples that can help you decide</a>.</p>

<h3>How HMRC works out your eligibility based on your tax returns</h3>

<p>To work out your eligibility we will first look at your 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return. Your trading profits must be no more than £50,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income.</p>

<p>If you’re not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, we will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.</p>

<h3>How different circumstances affect the scheme</h3>

<p>There are some circumstances that can affect your eligibility such as if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your return is late, amended or under enquiry</li>
  <li>you’re a member of a partnership</li>
  <li>you had a new child</li>
  <li>you have loans covered by the loan charge</li>
  <li>you claim averaging relief</li>
  <li>you’re a military reservist</li>
  <li>you’re non-resident or chose the remittance basis</li>
  <li>state aid</li>
</ul>

<p>Find out more information on how your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme">circumstances affect your eligibility</a>.</p>

<h2>How to claim</h2>

<p>Claims for the third SEISS grant have now closed. The last date to make a claim for the third grant was 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/reporting-fraudulent-emails" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC</a> if you receive any suspicious texts, calls or emails claiming to be from HMRC as this may be a scam.</p>

<h2>How we work out the amount of the third grant</h2>

<p>This is an example of how we will work out how much grant you’ll get if your average trading profits were £42,000 over the last 3 tax years.</p>

<p>If you’re eligible, you’ll receive a grant worth of 80% paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Start with your average trading profit (£42,000).</li>
  <li>Divide by 12 = £3,500.</li>
  <li>Multiply by 3 = £10,500.</li>
  <li>Work out 80% of £10,500 = £8,400. You will only receive £7,500 due to the cap.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Further support</h2>

<p>There will be a fourth grant covering February 2021 to April 2021. Details about the fourth grant will be announced on 3 March 2021.</p>

<h2>Other help you can get</h2>

<h3>Get other financial support</h3>

<p>You may be able to claim Universal Credit, but even if the claim is not approved it will affect any tax credits you claim, and may affect other benefits. So you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/how-tax-credits-affect-other-benefits">check how tax credits and other benefits affect each other</a></li>
  <li>find out what to do <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-what-to-do-if-youre-already-getting-benefits" class="govuk-link">if you’re already getting benefits</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you make a claim for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-employment-and-universal-credit">Universal Credit</a> the grant may affect the amount you get, but will not affect Universal Credit claims for earlier periods.</p>

<p>The government is also providing the following help for the self-employed:</p>
