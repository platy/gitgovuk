<h2>If you were living in Belgium before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Belgium since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/" rel="external">advice of the Belgian Government</a> and your local authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium">Belgium travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Belgium, read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Belgium</a> and read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.belgium.be/en/family/residence_documents_for_belgium" rel="external">Belgian governmentâ€™s guidance on residency documents</a>.</p>

<p>You must inform your local municipality (commune/gemeente) if your circumstances change. For example, tell them if you move home or change your marital status, so your registration is kept up-to-date. This applies to everyone in your household.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Belgium before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you applied for the â€˜Mâ€™ card by 31 December 2021, your rights are protected by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a> pending a decision on your application. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dofi.ibz.be/en/themes/brexit" rel="external">Belgian governmentâ€™s guidance on residency rights</a>. You should continue the process to get your â€˜Mâ€™ card if you do not yet have it.</p>

<p>You should keep hold of your certificate of application â€˜annexe/bijlage 56â€™ as evidence of your rights. Seek written confirmation from your commune/gemeente if you have started the application process but not yet received your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not had a response to your â€˜Mâ€™ card application, ask your commune/gemeente for an update. If they cannot update you, you can email the Office for Foreigners (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:infodesk@ibz.fgov.be">infodesk@ibz.fgov.be</a>) or call +3224 88 80 00.</p>

<p>If your application is successful, you will receive your â€˜Mâ€™ card, valid for 5 years. If you already have permanent residency, your â€˜Mâ€™ card will show this and will be valid for 10 years.</p>

<p>You must renew your â€˜Mâ€™ card when it expires. Contact your commune/gemeente for more information.</p>

<h3>Appeal process</h3>

<p>If your application is refused, your refusal letter, known as â€˜annexe/bijlage 59â€™, will tell you how to appeal.</p>

<h3>If you have a â€˜Pâ€™ or â€˜Sâ€™ card</h3>

<p>If you were resident in Belgium with a â€˜Pâ€™ or â€˜Sâ€™ card (a special residence permit) before 1 January 2021, you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. You can choose to register with your commune/gemeente and obtain the new â€˜Mâ€™ residency card.</p>

<p>Read the Belgian governmentâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/Protocol/brexit" rel="external">guidance on special residence permit holders</a>.</p>

<h3>Late applications</h3>

<p>The deadline for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dofi.ibz.be/en/themes/brexit" rel="external">applying for the â€˜Mâ€™ card</a> was 31 December 2021. You can still apply if you have reasonable grounds for missing it, and should do so as soon as possible. Contact your commune/gemeente to ask about the process. Applications will be considered on an individual basis.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Belgium at any time in the future. Find more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>. They must travel to Belgium and then submit an â€˜Mâ€™ card application as your family member. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dofi.ibz.be/en/themes/brexit/procedures/procedures-residence-card-beneficiaries-withdrawal-agreement/you-are" rel="external">Belgian governmentâ€™s guidance for family members</a>.</p>

<p>Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Belgian authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dofi.ibz.be/en/themes/brexit/beneficiaries-withdrawal-agreement/situation-after-application-period-1-january-2022" rel="external">Belgian government guidance for 1 January 2022 onwards</a> which we expect to be updated shortly.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-belgium#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Belgium.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Belgium</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Belgium travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Belgium using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Belgium with a Belgian residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Belgium, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Belgium before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, carry your residence card (â€˜Mâ€™ card) or frontier worker permit (â€˜Nâ€™ card) issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence card, show your certificate of application (annexe/bijlage 56 for the residence card or annexe/bijlage 57 for a frontier worker permit).</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Belgium, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Belgium with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-belgium/">guidance on healthcare in Belgium</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>

<p>You must register with a health insurance fund (mutuelle/ziekenfonds) to access the healthcare system if you are resident in Belgium. If you are working, both you and your employer will make contributions to your social security and healthcare system through the mutuelle/ziekenfonds. The amount you have to pay is set by the Belgian government.</p>

<p>When you visit a doctor or pharmacist, you need to pay and then send the receipt to your mutuelle/ziekenfonds.</p>

<p>The amount youâ€™ll be refunded depends on the health services covered by your insurance.</p>
