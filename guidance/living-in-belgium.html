</ul>
</div>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>You should follow the <a href="https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">advice of the Belgian Government</a> and your local authority. You can also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium" class="govuk-link">Belgium travel advice</a> for our latest guidance.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Belgium see our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-belgium">sign up to email alerts</a> to this guidance</li>
  <li>follow the British Embassy in Brussels on <a rel="external" href="https://www.facebook.com/ukinbelgium" class="govuk-link">Facebook</a> and <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/UKinBelgium">Twitter</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Attend a citizen outreach meeting</h3>

<p>The British Embassy regularly holds events across Belgium for UK nationals. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/information-and-events-for-british-citizens-in-belgium" class="govuk-link">Attend one of our citizen outreach meetings</a> to keep up to date on working and living in Belgium.</p>

<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Belgium before 1 January 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>. You must apply for a new residence status before 31 December 2021 to secure your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<h3>Residency</h3>

<p>If you were resident in Belgium before 1 January 2021, you must apply for the new residence card (‘M’ card) by 31 December 2021. This residence card is for UK nationals and their UK or non-EU family members who have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p><a href="https://dofi.ibz.be/sites/dvzoe/EN/Application-guides/Pages/Brexit-5.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Read the Office for Foreigner’s guidance for detailed information on the application process.</a></p>

<p>Note that residency is separate to citizenship.</p>

<h3>If you have an ‘E’ or ‘E+’ card</h3>

<p>You should have received a letter from the Belgian State Secretary for Asylum and Migration about the new residence card (‘M’ card). If you did not receive the letter, and think you should have, contact your local municipality (‘commune’ in French, ‘gemeente’ in Dutch).</p>

<p>Your local municipality will get in touch with you directly to outline the application process. You must follow the steps and deadlines outlined by your municipality, as these may differ locally.</p>

<p>You will need to provide a criminal record extract. The extract can be from the UK, Belgium or another country where you lived prior to Belgium. The UK extract can be issued by either DBS or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" rel="external">ACRO</a>. A Belgian extract (‘extrait de casier judiciaire’/’uittreksel uit het strafregister’) can be obtained from your local municipality.</p>

<p>You must apply for the ‘M’ card by 31 December 2021. If your application is successful, your ‘M’ card will be valid for 5 years. If you already have permanent residency, your ‘M’ card will reference this and will be valid for 10 years.</p>

<h3>If you do not have an E or E+ card</h3>

<p>If you started the process of registering your residency at your local municipality (commune/gemeente) before 1 January 2021, but have not completed it, you will not have an ‘E’ or ‘E+’ card. Your residency application will still be assessed under both previous EU rules and the new requirements for the ‘M’ card.</p>

<p>In line with previous EU rules, you may have to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 passport-sized photos</li>
  <li>originals and copies of your passport</li>
  <li>the lease for your apartment or house</li>
  <li>documents proving you can support yourself in Belgium, such as your employment contract or proof of your pension</li>
  <li>proof of health insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to provide a criminal record extract (see above).</p>

<p>The police will verify your address by making a house call. If you’re not at home, the officer will leave a card giving you an appointment at your local police station.</p>

<p>Once your address has been verified, you’ll get a statement of registration and you can apply for an electronic residence card. This is valid for 5 years and costs around €20.</p>

<p>You must inform your local municipality (commune/gemeente) if your circumstances change. For example, tell them if you move home or change your marital status, so that registration can be kept up-to-date. This applies to everyone in your household.</p>

<p>Read the Belgian government’s <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://dofi.ibz.be/sites/dvzoe/EN/Application-guides/Pages/Brexit.aspx">guidance on residency rights</a>.</p>

<h3>Special ID card holders</h3>

<p>If you were resident in Belgium on a special ID card (‘P’ or ‘S’ card) before 1 January 2021, you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. You can choose to register with your commune/gemeente and obtain the new ‘M’ residency card at any time.</p>

<p>Read the Belgian government’s <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/Protocol/brexit">guidance on special ID holders</a>.</p>

<h3>Moving to Belgium</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/belgium/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Belgium</a> and read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.belgium.be/en/family/residence_documents_for_belgium" class="govuk-link">Belgian government’s guidance on residency documents</a>.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register with a health insurance fund (mutuelle/ziekenfonds) to access the healthcare system if you are resident in Belgium. If you are working, both you and your employer will make contributions to your social security and healthcare system through the mutuelle/ziekenfonds. The amount you have to pay is set by the Belgian government.</p>

<p>When you visit a doctor or pharmacist, you need to pay and then send the receipt to your mutuelle/ziekenfonds. The amount you’ll be refunded depends on the health services covered by your insurance</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.belgium.be/en/brexit/i_am_private_citizen/british_citizens_belgium/health_and_social_security_entitlements" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Belgian government guidance on health and social security entitlements</a>. Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-belgium/" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare in Belgium</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Belgium temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-belgium#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>An S1 form allows you to access to UK-funded healthcare in Belgium. If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Belgium before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Belgium and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-belgium#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Belgium</a> to ensure you are registered correctly for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you were living in Belgium before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Belgium</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a resident in Belgium and your healthcare is covered by the Belgian authorities, then you may be entitled to a Belgian EHIC. You will be able to use your Belgian EHIC for emergency or needs-arising care in the EU, EFTA states, Switzerland and in the UK. Apply for a Belgian EHIC through your Mutuelle or Ziekenfonds.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence card, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your card, carry your certificate of application (“annexe” 8, 56 or 57).</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence card, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Belgium. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Belgium, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Belgium.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Belgium.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Belgium, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Check each country’s travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Driving in Belgium</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Belgium, you should <a href="https://mobilit.belgium.be/en/road_traffic/driving_licence/brexit" rel="external" class="govuk-link">exchange your UK licence for a Belgian driving licence</a>.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>If you are registered as a resident in Belgium, you must <a href="https://www.belgium.be/fr/mobilite/vehicules/immatriculation" rel="external" class="govuk-link">register your vehicle with the Belgian authorities</a>. You can read the European Union’s guidance on <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/belgium/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">car registration rules and taxes</a>. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2>Working in Belgium</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Belgium before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>If you are planning to come to Belgium to work, you may need a work permit. Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.belgium.be/en/work/coming_to_work_in_belgium/work_permit" class="govuk-link">Belgian government’s guidance on work permits</a>.</p>

<p>To apply for a job you may need to apply for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx">UK police certificate</a></li>
  <li>Belgian criminal records certificate (‘extrait de casier judiciaire’/’uittreksel uit het strafregister’), which you can request at your local municipality (commune/gemeente)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Belgium and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country before 1 January 2021, you may need a permit to show that you are a frontier worker. You must also apply for the new residence card (‘M’ card).</p>

<p>If you live in the UK or another EU or EFTA country and regularly commuted to work in Belgium before 1 January 2021, you must apply for the new frontier worker permit (‘N’ card). Contact the local municipality (commune/gemeente) where you work for more information.</p>

<h3>Posted workers</h3>

<p>If you were posted to Belgium before 1 January 2021, you must apply for a new residence status to secure your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Belgian nationals, as long as you were legally resident in Belgium before 1 January 2021. You must apply for the new residence card (‘M’ card).</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-students-in-the-eu-continuing-your-studies" class="govuk-link">continuing your studies in the EU</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-belgium#studying-in-belgium" class="govuk-link">healthcare for students in Belgium</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>You may need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in Belgium. When doing this, you will be subject to the third country regulations.</p>

<p>If you need to take action to secure the recognition of your academic or professional qualification in Belgium, <a rel="external" href="https://business.belgium.be/en/managing_your_business/qualifications_professionnelles" class="govuk-link">visit the Business Belgium website</a>.</p>

<p>If your qualification was officially recognised by the relevant regulator in Belgium before 1 January 2021, make sure you understand the terms of your recognition decision by checking with that regulator.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Belgium to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Belgium have not changed.</p>

<p>Read guidance about:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Belgium.</p>

<h3>Declaration of assets</h3>

<p>All residents must declare assets outside Belgium, including bank accounts, securities, rights, insurance, annuities and property. The declaration is separate to the annual tax return, and there are severe penalties and criminal charges if you do not comply.</p>

<p>All non-residents have a legal obligation to file an annual Belgian tax return if they receive income, including a pension, from Belgium.</p>

<h3>National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">pay National Insurance in the UK or social security contributions</a> in Belgium.</p>

<h3>Banking</h3>

<p>Whether UK banks can provide services to customers living in the EEA is a matter of local law and regulation. Your bank or finance provider should contact you if they need to make any changes to your product or the way they provide it. If you have any concerns about whether you might be affected, contact your provider or seek independent financial advice.</p>
