<p>This information is about visiting Ireland. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-ireland" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance for healthcare if you’re going to live, study or work in Ireland</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re ordinarily resident in the UK, you can get necessary medical care from state healthcare services in Ireland. You can use a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or show proof of your UK residency.</p>

<p>You should also buy travel insurance before you travel to Ireland.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period">Healthcare during the transition period</h2>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals visiting or living in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or show proof of your UK residency when you visit Ireland during this time, as you did before.</p>

<p>If you’re visiting Ireland on 31 December 2020, you can continue to access medically necessary state healthcare in Ireland until the end of your visit.</p>

<p>Make sure you have travel insurance for your visit.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-healthcare">How to get healthcare</h2>
<p>Show proof that you’re ordinarily resident in the UK when you visit an <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/maps/" class="govuk-link">Irish state doctor or hospital</a> such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a valid driving licence</li>
  <li>proof of residence</li>
  <li>documentation that shows your NHS Number</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a UK passport</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to pay in full for treatment if you do not have a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or proof of residency.</p>

<h3 id="what-youre-entitled-to">What you’re entitled to</h3>
<p>If you’re ordinarily resident in the UK, you can access medically necessary state health services on the same basis as an Irish resident. You may still need to pay a fee for some services, just like an Irish resident.</p>

<p>Some emergency services are free, such as GP visits or emergency dental treatment. You’ll still have to pay for some things. For example, you’ll be charged a fee of €100 for a visit to A&E without a doctor’s referral.</p>

<p>You’ll need to pay in full for private healthcare.</p>

<h2 id="travelling-with-a-health-condition">Travelling with a health condition</h2>
<p>Buy <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance" class="govuk-link">travel insurance</a> with healthcare cover for your condition.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions" class="govuk-link">Read the Money and Pensions Advice Service guidance for buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a>.</p>

<p>If your condition means that you’ll need treatment while you’re in Ireland, you may need to pre-arrange it. For example, if you need dialysis or oxygen treatment. Speak to your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel.</p>

<h3 id="getting-prescriptions">Getting prescriptions</h3>
<p>You can use a UK prescription to get medicines from pharmacies in Ireland.</p>

<p>You will have to pay in full for any prescription medicine.</p>

<h3 id="bringing-medicine-with-you">Bringing medicine with you</h3>
<p>You need a letter to prove your medicine is prescribed to you if it contains a ‘controlled drug’. You may need to show this at the border when you’re entering or leaving the UK.</p>

<p>You may also need a licence for controlled drugs if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your trip is longer than 3 months</li>
  <li>you’re travelling with more than 3 months’ supply</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about <a href="http://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">travelling with controlled medicines</a>.</p>

<h2 id="travelling-to-have-planned-treatment">Travelling to have planned treatment</h2>

<p>If you want to have non-urgent planned treatment in Ireland, you can apply for NHS funding. For example, if you’re going abroad to give birth.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways to do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>S2 route</li>
  <li>EU directive route</li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/" class="govuk-link">Read the NHS guide to seeking medical treatment abroad</a> for more information on these funding routes.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-ireland-from-1-january-2021">Healthcare for UK nationals visiting Ireland from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>You’ll still be able to access medically necessary state healthcare for visits that begin after 1 January 2021 if you’re either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner living in the EU before the end of 2020</li>
  <li>a UK student studying in in the EU before the end of 2020</li>
  <li>a ‘frontier worker’ (someone who works in one state and lives in another) before the end of 2020, for as long as you continue to be a frontier worker in the host state</li>
  <li>an EU national living in the UK before the end of 2020</li>
</ul>
