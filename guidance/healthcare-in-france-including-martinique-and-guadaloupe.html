<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in France.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This information is about living in France. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting France</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You must have health insurance cover to live in France.</p>

<p>State healthcare in France is not free. Healthcare costs are covered by both the state and through patient contributions. These are known as co-payments.</p>

<p>You may have to pay upfront for some treatments. The French national insurance fund, Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie (CPAM), will then repay you for part of the costs later.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the French healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making French social security contributions through their employer or as a self-employed person</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with the local CPAM office</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in France</h2>
<p>You can apply to be covered by the French healthcare system (Protection Universelle Maladie or ‘<abbr title="Protection Universelle Maladie">PUMa</abbr>’) if you’ve been a resident in France for at least 3 months. If you’re employed in France, you can apply as soon as you start work. You’ll have access to state healthcare on the same basis as a French citizen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-france" class="govuk-link">Find out more about becoming resident in France</a></p>

<p>You’ll pay for <abbr title="Protection Universelle Maladie">PUMa</abbr> through social security contributions if you are employed or self-employed in France.</p>

<p>If you are not employed you may have to pay into <abbr title="Protection Universelle Maladie">PUMa</abbr> yourself. There’s more information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure/droits-demarches/etudes-emploi-retraite/sans-emploi/sans-emploi" rel="external">CPAM website</a> (in French).</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a French <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>You can apply for <abbr title="Protection Universelle Maladie">PUMa</abbr> through your local CPAM office. There’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/english-pages" class="govuk-link">information about how to register</a> online.</p>

<p>Once registered, you’ll get a temporary social security number by post after 1 to 3 months.</p>

<p>You’ll then receive a document called an ‘attestation de droits à l’assurance maladie’. This confirms your right to French state healthcare and your French social security number.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got that document, you can apply for your French state healthcare card, the ‘<a href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/remboursements/etre-bien-rembourse/carte-vitale" rel="external" class="govuk-link">carte vitale</a>’. Take it with you whenever you visit a doctor, pharmacy or specialist provider.</p>

<p>It can take 6 months or longer to get a carte vitale. If you have questions about your application, <a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure/adresses-et-contacts/un-autre-sujet" class="govuk-link">contact your local CPAM office</a>.</p>

<p>If you need healthcare before you receive your card, use your social security number. Ask your healthcare provider for a ‘<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/remboursements/etre-bien-rembourse/feuille-soins-papier">feuille de soins</a>’ and send it to your CPAM office to be refunded for any treatment you’ve paid for.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>State healthcare in France is not free. You may have to pay some of the cost of any treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you understand what you’ll be charged and how much of that you’ll get back through state healthcare cover. There’s <a href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/remboursements" rel="external" class="govuk-link">information (in French) about reimbursements online</a>.</p>

<p>You can also get top-up insurance called a ‘mutuelle’. This will cover all or part of your medical costs not covered by the state.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to France temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in France using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. This can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<p>You should register your S1 with your <a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure/adresses-et-contacts/un-autre-sujet" class="govuk-link">local CPAM</a>.</p>

<p>You may also need a UK-issued A1 certificate to show that you pay national insurance in the UK. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-application-for-form-e101-if-self-employed-in-european-economic-area-ca3837">get this from HMRC</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>, you’ll need to show the card when you go to your appointment.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in France</h2>
<p>There’s different guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="#posted-worker">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-france" class="govuk-link">French resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living France before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it at your local CPAM office.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in France on the same basis as a French citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll still have to pay part of your medical costs, just like other French residents.</p>

<p>You can also get top-up insurance called a ‘mutuelle’. This will cover all or part of your medical costs that are not covered by state repayments.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in France than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in France</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 with your local CPAM office. There’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/english-pages" rel="external">information about how to register</a> online.</p>

<p>Once registered, you’ll get a temporary social security number by post after 1 to 3 months.</p>

<p>You’ll then receive a document called an ‘attestation de droits à l’assurance maladie’. This confirms your right to French state healthcare and your French social security number.</p>

Take it with you whenever you visit a doctor, pharmacy or specialist provider.</p>

<p>It can take 6 months or longer to get a carte vitale. If you have questions about your application, <a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure/adresses-et-contacts/un-autre-sujet" class="govuk-link">contact your local CPAM office</a>.</p>

<p>If you need healthcare before you receive your card, use your social security number. Ask your healthcare provider for a ‘<a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/remboursements/etre-bien-rembourse/feuille-soins-papier" class="govuk-link">feuille de soins</a>’ and send it to your CPAM office to be refunded for any treatment you’ve paid for.</p>

<h2>Studying in France</h2>
<p>You can use an <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/ehic" rel="external"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or a <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period in France.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
