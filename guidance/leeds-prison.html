<h2>Book and plan your visit to Leeds</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Leeds you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit at least 24 hours in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-Leeds">required ID</a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit.</p>

<p>Sentenced and convicted prisoners are entitled to 3 visits every 28 days. Visits last one hour. They can also earn extra visits each month depending on their privileges.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Leeds</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

<h3>Help with the cost of your visit</h3>
<p>If you get certain benefits or have an NHS health certificate, you might be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help-with-prison-visits">get help with the costs of your visit</a>, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travel to Leeds</li>
  <li>somewhere to stay overnight</li>
  <li>meals</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to book family and friends visits</h3>

<p>Leeds is running a limited visits schedule. Visits are also happening differently than normal, observing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic">strict guidelines, which must be followed</a>.</p>

<p>You can book by telephone. We are not currently accepting online bookings.
Booking line number: 01132 032 995</p>

<p>The booking line is open Monday to Friday, 8am to 10am and midday to 2pm.</p>

<p>Email (enquiries only): <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:socialvisits.leeds@hmps.gsi.gov.uk">socialvisits.leeds@hmps.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>If you are an ex-offender and have been in prison before, you must make a formal request in writing to security before you book a visit. Include the name of the man you want to visit, your name and date of birth and previous prisoner number (if known). Also mention any license conditions still in effect. If approved, you will get a letter from the security department. Bring that letter to each visit as proof you have been cleared.</p>

<p>People who are on Home Detention Curfew (HDC) or on licence must also bring a copy of the licence with their approval letter to the visit.</p>

<h4>Visiting times:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Thursday to Sunday: 9am to 10:30am and 2pm to 3:30pm</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to book legal and professional visits</h3>

<p>Legal visits are only taking place by video link which can be booked by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:vccleeds@justice.gov.uk">vccleeds@justice.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Parking is very limited at the prison but there is plenty in the surrounding residential area.</p>

<h3>Entering Leeds</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Leeds has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Leeds. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. Pushchairs and car seats can enter the prison but will be thoroughly searched.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Leeds</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Leeds.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners (except for those on a restricted regime or in segregation) have phones in their rooms. They can only make outgoing calls so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this and can call between 7am and 10pm.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>Men can also use the phones on their unit.</p>

<p>Depending on their daily activity, they can call between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>8:15am to 8:45pm</li>
  <li>10:30am to 11:30am</li>
  <li>3:15pm to 4:30pm</li>
  <li>6pm to 7pm</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Leeds using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Leeds.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Leeds</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Leeds are given a list of approved items that can be sent to them as gifts. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Leeds</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>You can only bring in items if the prisoner has applied for and been granted permission. They also must have detailed the items.</p>

<p>They can only be brought in by person and accepted at these times:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monday: 9am to 11am, 1:30pm to 4pm</li>
  <li>Wednesday: 9am to 11am, 1:30pm to 4pm</li>

  <li>Saturday: 9:30am to 11am, 1:30pm to 4pm</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Life at Leeds</h2>
<p>Leeds is committed to providing a safe and educational environment where men can learn new skills to help them on release.</p>

<h3>Security and safeguarding</h3>
<p>Every person at Leeds has a right to feel safe. The staff are responsible for their safeguarding and welfare at all times.</p>

<p>For further information about what to do when you are worried or concerned about someone in prison <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/pages/category/need-urgent-help?Take=24" rel="external">visit the Prisoners’ Families helpline website</a>.</p>

<p>All safeguarding processes are overseen by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://leedssafeguardingadults.org.uk/" rel="external">Leeds Safeguarding Adults Board</a>.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>
<p>When someone first arrives at Leeds, they (or a member of staff) will contact their family by phone. This could be quite late in the evening, depending on the time they arrive.</p>

<p>All men are searched, then given their ID, a hot drink, a shower, a change of clothes and a hot meal.</p>

<p>They will get to speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>
<p>Each person who arrives at Leeds gets an induction that lasts about a week. They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone finds out about the rules, canteen, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Leeds has nearly 700 rooms, across 6 wings (A to F) which house over 1100 men. There are a mixture of single and shared rooms. All wings have exercise yards and gym equipment.</p>

<p>There are residential wings, a first-night centre, an incentivised substance-free living wing (ISFL) and a wing dedicated to vulnerable prisoners.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>
<p>In each 6-week period, the learning and skills department offers over 6000 class sessions, in a variety of subjects, ranging from business and self-employment to literacy and numeracy.</p>

<p>Leeds focuses on planning for each individual, so all men take a basic skills screening test when they arrive. This makes sure all men get the fundamental education they need in English and maths before they start work. This can then be matched to a realistic career plan so they can go on to get the skills and qualifications needed for work when they leave.</p>

<p>Leeds also works in partnership with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bouncebackproject.com/" rel="external">Bounceback</a> which offers City and Guilds qualifications in painting and decorating, carpentry and multi skills.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.stgilestrust.org.uk/" rel="external">St Giles</a> supports men into employment on release.</p>

<p>The Offender Management Unit (OMU) works with the men and voluntary and community services to help resettlement.</p>

<p>The ‘Fathers Inside’ programme helps fathers to develop and keep up good relationships with their children.</p>

<p>The Offender Assessment System (OASys) helps men change anti-social behaviour to reduce risk of harm and reoffending.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>
<p>A man in category D is assessed weekly to be considered for release on temporary licence (ROTL). If they meet the criteria, they go to the board for consideration and most are then prioritised for transfer to an open prison.</p>

<h3>Organisations Leeds works with</h3>
<p>The Offender Management Unit (OMU) works with the men and also with voluntary and community services to help resettlement.</p>

<p>It works with:</p>
