<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Slovenia.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-slovenia">Sign up for email alerts</a></p>
</div>

<p>This information is about living in Slovenia. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Slovenia</a>.</p>

<p>State healthcare in Slovenia is not completely free. Healthcare costs are covered by both the state and through patient contributions. These are known as co-payments.</p>

<p>If you’re a resident in Slovenia, you must have health insurance.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Slovenian healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying into the Slovenian national health insurance system (ZZZS)</li>
  <li>paying for private health insurance</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with ZZZS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Slovenia</h2>
<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-slovenia#visas-and-residency">register as a resident</a> if you’re living in Slovenia for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>All residents must pay for Slovenian national health insurance (<a href="http://www.zzzs.si/zzzs/internet/zzzseng.nsf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">ZZZS</a>). How much you pay will depend on your salary.</p>

<p>If you do not pay into the Slovenian health service, you’ll need private insurance to pay for any non-emergency healthcare.</p>

<p>Anyone can get emergency medical treatment regardless of their insurance cover.</p>

<p>Your dependants are also covered by the contributions you make.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Slovenian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>The ZZZS website has information about <a rel="external" href="https://zavezanec.zzzs.si/" class="govuk-link">registering for health insurance (in Slovene)</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re employed in Slovenia, your employer will register you with the ZZZS.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, check that you’re registered for healthcare at a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.zzzs.si/zzzs/internet/zzzseng.nsf/o/2F06FF8B47F026A3C1256E89004792A2">local ZZZS office</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re unemployed and receiving benefits you do not need to pay contributions.</p>

<p>Once you’ve registered, you’ll get a Slovenian health insurance card. Show this whenever you access state healthcare. It covers you for treatment by <a href="http://www.nkt-z.si/wps/portal/nktz/home/healthcare/providers/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziTQxdPd2N_Q08DfyCDAwc3b0NwnxcTQzcjYz1g1Pz9AuyHRUBAQKe3g!!/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">healthcare providers contracted to the ZZZS</a>.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GP visits</li>
  <li>state hospitals</li>
  <li>health centres</li>
  <li>state dental care</li>
  <li>private doctors who have a contract with the ZZZS</li>
  <li>prescription costs</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to register with a GP. They will usually be your first point of contact to access specialists and hospital treatment.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>You’ll usually have to pay between 10% and 90% of the cost of most non-emergency healthcare in Slovenia.</p>

<p>Most people in Slovenia have private voluntary health insurance to cover any co-payments you must make. This costs around 35 euros a month.</p>

<p>If you’re registered for state healthcare with ZZZS, you can get voluntary insurance. This means you will not pay for state healthcare services. Your healthcare provider will charge your insurance company directly.</p>

<p>You’ll only have to pay if you see a GP or get dental treatment at a private clinic.</p>

<p>If you don’t have voluntary insurance, you’ll need to make the co-payment yourself.</p>

<p>Some people get free healthcare and are exempt from co-payments, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children</li>
  <li>students</li>
  <li>pregnant women</li>
  <li>people with long-term or chronic conditions</li>
  <li>unemployed people or those on low incomes</li>
</ul>

<p>A&amp;E care and treatment is free, as are certain state healthcare services. <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.zzzs.si/zzzs/internet/zzzseng.nsf/o/87C028D74130DE0AC1256E89004A4C0C">Find out what’s covered by ZZZS</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll usually have to pay either 30% or 90% of the full cost of a prescription, depending on the medication. The ZZZS also sets a maximum amount payable for each medicine. Your doctor will be able to tell you how much you’ll need to pay.</p>

<p>If you have a chronic illness or long-term condition, you can get free prescriptions.</p>

<p>You’ll always have to pay in full for your healthcare when you visit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providers who do not have a contract with the ZZZS</li>
  <li>specialists without a GP’s referral</li>
  <li>private dentists</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Slovenia temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Slovenia using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Slovenia</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="#posted-worker">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-slovenia">Slovenian resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Slovenia before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it with the ZZZS.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Slovenia on the same basis as a Slovenian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Slovenia than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Slovenia</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 in person at a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.zzzs.si/zzzs/internet/zzzseng.nsf/o/2F06FF8B47F026A3C1256E89004792A2" rel="external">local ZZZS office</a>. You’ll be able to get help filling out the forms if you don’t speak Slovene.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof that you get a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>proof of identity, such as your passport</li>
</ul>

<p>Once registered, you will be issued with a Slovenian health insurance card. This will show you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Slovenian citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Slovenia</h2>
<p>You can use an <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<p>If you’re studying in Slovenia for more than 3 months, you should register for a Slovenian health insurance card.</p>

<p>You’ll need to register in person at a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.zzzs.si/zzzs/internet/zzzseng.nsf/o/2F06FF8B47F026A3C1256E89004792A2" rel="external">ZZZS office</a>. Take your passport and proof that you’re enrolled on a course in Slovenia.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
