<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Slovenia.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-slovenia" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts</a></p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This information is about living in Slovenia. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Slovenia</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>State healthcare in Slovenia is not completely free. Healthcare costs are covered by both the state and through patient contributions. These are known as co-payments.</p>

<p>If you’re a resident in Slovenia, you must have health insurance.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Slovenian healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying into the Slovenian national health insurance system (ZZZS)</li>
  <li>paying for private health insurance</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays when studying, or as a ‘posted’ (detached) worker</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued S1 form with ZZZS (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Slovenia’ below)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Slovenia</h2>

<p>If you are planning on moving to Slovenia, see the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-slovenia">Living in Slovenia</a> for more information about visa and residency requirements.</p>

<p>You must show proof of healthcare cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before you can register as a resident</li>
  <li>when you apply for a visa</li>
</ul>

<p>For details about the healthcare cover required for residency applications, contact local authorities in Slovenia or the appropriate Slovenian embassy or consulate in the UK.</p>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-slovenia" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> if you’re living in Slovenia for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>All residents must pay for Slovenian national health insurance (<a href="https://www.zzzs.si/en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">ZZZS</a>). How much you pay will depend on your salary.</p>

<p>If you do not pay into the Slovenian health service, you’ll need private insurance to pay for any non-emergency healthcare.</p>

<p>Anyone can get emergency medical treatment regardless of their insurance cover.</p>

<p>Your dependants are also covered by the contributions you make.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Slovenian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a UK S1 if you start drawing a UK State Pension (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Slovenia’ below).</p>

<h3>How to register for healthcare</h3>
<p>The ZZZS website has information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.zzzs.si/en/compulsory-health-insurance/inclusion-in-the-compulsory-health-insurance/" class="govuk-link">registering for health insurance</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re employed in Slovenia, your employer will register you with the ZZZS.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, check that you’re registered for healthcare at a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.zzzs.si/en/about-us/contacts/">local ZZZS office</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re unemployed and receiving benefits you do not need to pay contributions.</p>

<p>Once you’ve registered, you’ll get a Slovenian health insurance card. Show this whenever you access state healthcare. It covers you for treatment by <a href="http://www.nkt-z.si/wps/portal/nktz/home/healthcare/providers/!ut/p/z1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIjo8ziTQxdPd2N_Q08DfyCDAwc3b0NwnxcTQzcjYz1g1Pz9AuyHRUBAQKe3g!!/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">healthcare providers contracted to the ZZZS</a>.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GP visits</li>
  <li>state hospitals</li>
  <li>health centres</li>
  <li>state dental care</li>
  <li>private doctors who have a contract with the ZZZS</li>
  <li>prescription costs</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to register with a GP. They will usually be your first point of contact to access specialists and hospital treatment.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>You’ll usually have to pay between 10% and 90% of the cost of most non-emergency healthcare in Slovenia.</p>

<p>Most people in Slovenia have private voluntary health insurance to cover any co-payments you must make. This costs around 35 euros a month.</p>

<p>If you’re registered for state healthcare with ZZZS, you can get voluntary insurance. This means you will not pay for state healthcare services. Your healthcare provider will charge your insurance company directly.</p>

<p>You’ll only have to pay if you see a GP or get dental treatment at a private clinic.</p>

<p>If you don’t have voluntary insurance, you’ll need to make the co-payment yourself.</p>

<p>Some people get free healthcare and are exempt from co-payments, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children</li>
  <li>students</li>
  <li>pregnant women</li>
  <li>people with long-term or chronic conditions</li>
  <li>unemployed people or those on low incomes</li>
</ul>

<p>A&amp;E care and treatment is free, as are certain state healthcare services.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.zzzs.si/en/compulsory-health-insurance/the-extent-of-rights-deriving-from-compulsory-health-insurance/" class="govuk-link">Find out what’s covered by ZZZS</a></p>

<p>You’ll usually have to pay either 30% or 90% of the full cost of a prescription, depending on the medication. The ZZZS also sets a maximum amount payable for each medicine. Your doctor will be able to tell you how much you’ll need to pay.</p>

<p>If you have a chronic illness or long-term condition, you can get free prescriptions.</p>

<p>You’ll always have to pay in full for your healthcare when you visit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providers who do not have a contract with the ZZZS</li>
  <li>specialists without a GP’s referral</li>
  <li>private dentists</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Slovenia temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Slovenia using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Slovenia</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance if you have an S1 as a ‘posted worker’ (see ‘If your UK employer has sent you to Slovenia temporarily (‘posted workers’)’ above).</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a resident in Slovenia and receive a UK State Pension or an exportable benefit. See <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/planning-your-healthcare/" class="govuk-link">Planning your healthcare abroad</a> on the NHS website for more information about eligibility.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it with the ZZZS.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Slovenia on the same basis as a Slovenian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/global-health-insurance-card" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" rel="external">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Slovenia than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<p>If you’re entitled to an S1 form as a dependant of a State Pensioner, your health cover will be cancelled once you begin claiming your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You will be sent a new S1 form to your registered address from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services. You must register this form to ensure continuation of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>You are responsible for informing NHS Overseas Healthcare Services if you change your address or your circumstances change.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension or another qualifying exportable benefit, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services (see contact details above).</p>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Slovenia</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 in person at a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.zzzs.si/en/about-us/contacts/">local ZZZS office</a>. You’ll be able to get help filling in the forms if you do not speak Slovene.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof that you get a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>proof of identity, such as your passport</li>
</ul>

<p>Once registered, you will be issued with a Slovenian health insurance card. This will show you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Slovenian citizen.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If you are experiencing delays registering your S1 with local authorities and require emergency or urgent treatment, contact the Overseas Healthcare Services on 0044 191 218 1999.</p>
</div>

<h2>Studying in Slovenia</h2>
<p>You should apply for a Student <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> to get medically necessary, state-provided healthcare for the duration of your study period in Slovenia, whether this is for part or all of your course. This means that you’ll get necessary healthcare services on the same basis as a Slovenian citizen either for free or at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>If you already hold a valid Student <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> you can use this until the card expires.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/" class="govuk-link">Read more about eligibility and how to apply</a></p>

<p>If you’re studying in Slovenia for more than 3 months, you should register for a Slovenian health insurance card.</p>

<p>You’ll need to register in person at a <a href="https://www.zzzs.si/en/about-us/contacts/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">ZZZS office</a>. Take your passport and proof that you’re enrolled on a course in Slovenia.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Because the NHS is a residency-based system, under NHS rules UK nationals who move abroad on a permanent basis may lose their entitlement to free NHS healthcare.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national and move to the EU, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK unless you have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, PRC or S2 to show your healthcare costs are funded by the EU country in which you now live, or another exemption applies.</p>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK war pensioners</li>
  <li>UK government employees</li>
  <li>UK nationals living in the EU on or before 31 December 2020, once they have a registered, UK-issued S1</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about using the NHS when you no longer live in the UK (see ‘UK nationals who no longer live in the UK’ in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-eu-and-efta-citizens-visiting-the-uk">Healthcare for visitors to the UK from the EU</a>).</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
