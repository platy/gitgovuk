<p>There’s separate guidance on what <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-maintained-schools-must-publish-online">schools maintained by a local authority must publish online</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If your school or college is one of the following types, you need to check your funding agreement to find out exactly what information you must publish on your website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/academies">academies</a>, including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/free-schools">free schools</a>, studio schools and university technical colleges</li>
  <li>sixth-form colleges</li>
  <li>general further education (<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>) colleges</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also publishing requirements set out in the Equality Act 2010 and the Children and Families Act 2014, and related regulations. You must comply with these.</p>

<p>This guidance gives an overview of those requirements and the further information that the Department for Education (DfE) recommends that these schools and colleges publish on their websites. Many academy trusts are under a duty to publish much of this further information, due to clauses in their funding agreements.</p>

<h2>School or college contact details</h2>

<p>Your website should include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of your school or college</li>
  <li>postal address of your school or college</li>
  <li>telephone number of your school or college</li>
  <li>name of the member of staff who deals with queries from parents and other members of the public</li>
  <li>name of the headteacher or principal</li>
  <li>name and contact details of the chair of the governing body (if you have one)</li>
  <li>name and contact details of your special educational needs co-ordinator (<abbr title="special educational needs co-ordinator">SENCO</abbr>) unless you’re a special academy or sixth form or <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> college</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re an academy, you should publish the website, address and telephone number of your academy trust.</p>

<h2>Admission arrangements</h2>

<h3>Academies</h3>

<p>Admission arrangements for all mainstream academy schools, other than academy special schools, alternative provision or stand-alone 16 to 19 institutions, must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">School Admissions Code</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">school admission appeals code</a>.</p>

<p>Academy trusts must publish the admission arrangements for their schools on their website by 15 March each year, and keep them there for the whole of the offer year. This is the school year in which offers for places are made.</p>

<p>The admission arrangements must explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how you will consider applications for each relevant age group at your schools - this is the age group at which children are normally admitted to the school</li>
  <li>what parents should do if they want to apply for their child to attend one of your schools</li>
  <li>your arrangements for selecting the pupils who apply (if the school is a selective school)</li>
  <li>your over-subscription criteria, outlining how you offer places if there are more applicants than places available</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also set out how in-year applications will be dealt with for your schools by 31 August at the latest each year.</p>

<p>If the academy trust will manage in-year applications for your schools, you must provide a suitable application form to enable parents to apply for an in-year place at your school. You must also provide a supplementary information form where necessary.</p>

<p>If the school is to be a part of the local authority’s in-year co-ordination scheme, you must provide information on where parents can find details of the relevant scheme.</p>

<p>You must also publish a timetable for organising and hearing admission appeals for your schools by 28 February each year.</p>

<p>This must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>include a deadline for lodging appeals which allows those making an appeal at least 20 school days from the date of notification that their application was unsuccessful to prepare and lodge their written appeal</li>
  <li>include reasonable deadlines for:
    <ul>
      <li>those making an appeal to submit additional evidence</li>
      <li>admission authorities to submit their evidence</li>
      <li>the clerk to send appeal papers to the panel and parties</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ensure that those making an appeal receive at least 10 school days’ notice of their appeal hearing</li>
  <li>ensure that decision letters are sent within 5 school days of the hearing wherever possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>16 to 19 academies and colleges</h3>

<p>If you’re a 16 to 19 academy, <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> college or sixth-form college, we recommend that you publish details of your admission arrangements.</p>

<p>You should publish this information a year before the beginning of the academic year to which arrangements apply, to help parents and students make an informed choice. We recommend that the arrangements do not change during the year. You should include details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open days your college or academy is planning</li>
  <li>the process for applying for a place at your college or academy</li>
  <li>whether your college or academy gives priority to applications from pupils enrolled at particular schools</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">school admissions code</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">school admissions appeal code</a> do not apply to 16 to 19 academies, FE colleges and sixth-form colleges.</p>
</div>

<h2>School uniforms</h2>

<p>The department produces statutory guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cost-of-school-uniforms">cost of school uniforms</a>. Schools must have regard to this guidance when developing and implementing their school uniform policy. This guidance requires schools to publish their uniform policy on their website.</p>

<p>The published uniform policy should be easy to understand and, where a school has a school uniform, should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clearly state whether an item is optional or required</li>
  <li>make clear if the item will only be worn at certain times of the year (for example, if it’s summer or winter uniform)</li>
  <li>make clear whether a generic item will be accepted or if a branded item is required</li>
  <li>make clear whether an item can only be purchased from a specific retailer or if it can be purchased more widely, including from second-hand retailers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ofsted reports</h2>

<p>You must publish either a copy of your school’s most recent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">Ofsted report</a> or a link to the report on the Ofsted website.</p>

<h2>Test, exam and assessment results</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-and-college-accountability-approach-2020-to-2022/school-and-college-accountability-2021-to-2022-academic-year">Key stage 4 and 16 to 18 performance measures will be published</a> by the Secretary of State for the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>For key stage 4 and 16 to 18 results, you should update your website to include the latest measures which, once published, will be based on tests, exams and assessments from the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>Alongside your key stage 4 and 16 to 18 results, you may wish to add the following sentence:</p>

<p>“Given the uneven impact of the pandemic on school and college performance data, the government has said you should not make direct comparisons between the performance data for one school or college and another, or to data from previous years.”</p>

<h3>Key stage 2 (end of primary school) results</h3>

<p>You do not need to publish your key stage 2 results for the academic year 2021 to 2022 on your website, as the Secretary of State will not publish this data. This is because statutory assessments returned for the first time since 2019, without adaptations, after disruption caused by the pandemic.</p>

<p>You should continue to display your school’s most recent key stage 2 performance measures, as published by the Secretary of State, on your website. For most schools, these will be the performance measures published for the 2018 to 2019 academic year.</p>

<p>You should clearly mark that these performance measures are for the 2018 to 2019 academic year and are not current. For example, you could add the following sentence to your results:</p>

<p>“The government will not publish <abbr title="key stage 2">KS2</abbr> school level data for the 2021 to 2022 academic year. They have archived data from the 2018 to 2019 academic year because they recognise that the data from that year may no longer reflect current performance.”</p>

<h3>Key stage 4 (secondary school) results</h3>

<p>You should publish the following details from your school’s most recent key stage 4 performance measures, as published by the Secretary of State. For most schools, once published, these will be the performance measures for the 2021 to 2022 academic year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/progress-8-school-performance-measure">Progress 8 score</a></li>
  <li>attainment in English and maths - percentage of pupils achieving a grade 5 or above in&nbsp;<abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>&nbsp;English and maths</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/progress-8-school-performance-measure">Attainment 8&nbsp;score</a></li>
  <li>English Baccalaureate (<abbr title="English Baccalaureate">EBacc</abbr>) average point score (APS)</li>
</ul>

<p>We suggest that schools also publish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the percentage of pupils that enter the English Baccalaureate (<abbr title="English Baccalaureate">EBacc</abbr>), and</li>
  <li>the percentage of pupils staying in education or going into employment after key stage 4 (pupil destinations)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key stage 5 (16 to 18) information</h3>

<p>Schools and colleges with 16 to 18 students should publish the&nbsp;most recent 16 to 18 performance measures,&nbsp;as published by the Secretary of State. For most schools or colleges, once published, these will be the performance measures for the 2021 to 2022 academic year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attainment</li>
  <li>retention</li>
  <li>destinations</li>
</ul>

<h4>Progress performance measures</h4>

<p>For schools and colleges with 16 to 18 students, you do not need to display progress measures (level 3 value added), or an English and mathematics progress measure, on your website. These measures will not be published for the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<h2>Performance measures website</h2>

<p>You should include a link to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/school-performance-tables">school and college performance measures website</a> and your school or colleges performance measures page.</p>

<h2>School opening hours</h2>

<p>Schools should publish on their website their opening and closing times and the total time this amounts to in a typical week (for example 32.5 hours).</p>

<p>Schools should show the compulsory times they are open. This time runs from the official start of the school day (morning registration) to the official end of the compulsory school day. It includes breaks, but not optional before or after school activities.</p>

<h2>Curriculum</h2>

<p>Academies should publish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the content of the curriculum your school follows in each academic year for every subject - this includes mandatory subjects such as religious education, even if it’s taught as part of another subject or subjects or is called something else</li>
  <li>how parents or other members of the public can find out more about the curriculum your school is following</li>
  <li>how you meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-study-programmes-advice-on-planning-and-delivery">16 to 19 study programme requirements</a> (if you have a sixth form or offer education at 16 to 19)</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on what phase of education your school offers, we recommend you also publish any of the following that apply to your school:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the names of any phonics or reading schemes you are using in key stage 1</li>
  <li>a list of the courses available to pupils at key stage 4, including <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSEs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the 16 to 19 qualifications you offer</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also set out how over time you will increase the extent to which disabled pupils participate in the school’s curriculum, as part of your school’s accessibility plan. There are more details in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#send">special educational needs and disabilities section</a>.</p>

<h2>Remote education</h2>

<p>You should consider publishing information about your school’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providing-remote-education-guidance-for-schools/providing-remote-education-guidance-for-schools">remote education provision</a> on your website. An optional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providing-remote-education-information-to-parents-template">template</a> is available to support schools with this.</p>

<h2>Behaviour policy</h2>

<p>Academies should publish details of the school’s behaviour policy, including their anti-bullying strategy. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools">guidance on developing and publishing your school’s behaviour policy</a>.</p>

<p>It’s good practice for <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> colleges to also publish this information.</p>

<h2>Pupil premium and recovery premium</h2>

<p>All schools that receive pupil premium funding must publish a pupil premium strategy statement each year by 31 December.</p>

<p>In the strategy statement, you must explain how your pupil premium and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recovery-premium-funding/recovery-premium-funding">recovery premium</a> is being spent and the outcomes that are being achieved for pupils. It’s important that parents and trustees understand this, and you should write it with them in mind.</p>

<p>You must use the DfE template to produce your statement. This can be found alongside completed examples and guidance for school leaders on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium">pupil premium</a> guidance page.</p>

<p>The template has been designed to ensure that your statement reflects the requirements in the pupil premium <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium-allocations-and-conditions-of-grant-2022-to-2023">conditions of grant</a>. This includes a requirement for pupil premium and recovery premium to be spent in line with the department’s ‘menu of approaches’ from the start of the 2022 to 2023 academic year. The menu can be found in the document ‘Using pupil premium: guidance for school leaders’, on the pupil premium guidance page.</p>

<p>We recommend that you plan your pupil premium use over 3 years. If you do so, you are still required to update your statement each year to reflect your spending activity for that academic year and the impact of pupil premium in the previous academic year.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport premium for primary schools</h2>

<p>If your school receives <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pe-and-sport-premium-for-primary-schools"><abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr>&nbsp;and sport premium funding</a>, you must publish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of premium received</li>
  <li>a full breakdown of how it has been spent (or will be spent)</li>
  <li>what impact the school has seen on pupils’&nbsp;<abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> and sport participation and attainment</li>
  <li>how the improvements will be sustainable in the future</li>
</ul>

<p>You are also required to publish the percentage of pupils within your year 6 cohort who met the national curriculum requirement to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>swim competently, confidently, and proficiently over a distance of at least 25 metres</li>
  <li>use a range of strokes effectively (for example front crawl, backstroke, and breaststroke)</li>
  <li>perform safe self-rescue in different water-based situations</li>
</ul>

<p>You must publish all the information in this section by the end of the summer term, or 31 July at the latest. This is outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pe-and-sport-premium-conditions-of-grant-2021-to-2022">conditions of grant document</a>.</p>

<p>To help plan, monitor and report on the impact of your spending, partners in the physical education and school sport sector have developed a template. The template can be accessed through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.afpe.org.uk/physical-education/advice-on-sport-premium/" rel="external">Association for <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr></a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthsporttrust.org/resources/primary-pe-sport-premium" rel="external">Youth Sport Trust</a> websites.</p>

<h2>Public sector equality duty</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/equality-act-2010-advice-for-schools">The Equality Act 2010: advice for schools</a> provides information as to how your school can demonstrate compliance with the public sector equality duty. For example, including details of how your school is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminating unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited under the Equality Act 2010</li>
  <li>advancing equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not</li>
  <li>fostering good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not</li>
  <li>consulting and involving those affected by inequality in the decisions your school or college takes to promote equality and eliminate discrimination - affected people could include parents, pupils, staff and members of the local community</li>
</ul>

<p>As public bodies, academies and <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> institutions must comply with the public sector equality duty in the Equality Act 2010 and the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017. This means you must publish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of how your school complies with the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/149" rel="external">public sector equality duty</a> - you must update this every year</li>
  <li>your school’s equality objectives - you must update this at least once every 4 years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Academy schools (but not <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> colleges and 16 to 19 academies) must publish an information report on your website about the implementation of your school’s policy for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>. Schools should update the report at least annually.</p>

<p>You should update any changes occurring during the year as soon as possible. The report must comply with section 69 of the Children and Families Act 2014, meaning that it must contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ‘<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> information’ specified in schedule 1 to the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1530/contents/made" rel="external">Special Educational Needs and Disability Regulations 2014</a>. Statutory guidance on this is contained in paragraphs 6.79 to 6.82 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">special educational needs and disability code of practice: 0 to 25 years</a>;</li>
  <li>information on:
    <ul>
      <li>the arrangements for the admission of disabled pupils</li>
      <li>the steps you have taken to prevent disabled pupils from being treated less favourably than other pupils</li>
      <li>the facilities you provide to help disabled pupils to access the school</li>
      <li>the plan prepared under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/schedule/10" rel="external">paragraph 3 of schedule 10 to the Equality Act 2010</a> (accessibility plan) for:
        <ul>
          <li>increasing the extent to which disabled pupils can participate in the school’s curriculum</li>
          <li>improving the physical environment of the school for the purpose of increasing the extent to which disabled pupils are able to take advantage of education and benefits, facilities or services provided or offered by the school</li>
          <li>improving the delivery to disabled pupils of information which is readily accessible to pupils who are not disabled</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Careers programme information</h2>

<p>Academies and colleges should publish information about their careers programme. This information should relate to the delivery of careers guidance to pupils from years 7 to 13 (11 to 18-year olds) and any requirement set out in your funding agreement to deliver careers guidance. For the current academic year, you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the school or college’s careers leader’s name, email address and telephone number</li>
  <li>a summary of the careers programme, including details of how pupils, parents, teachers and employers may access information about it</li>
  <li>how the school or college measures and assesses the careers programme’s impact on pupils</li>
  <li>the date of the school or college’s next review of the information published</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the statutory guidance for schools and colleges on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/careers-guidance-provision-for-young-people-in-schools">careers guidance and access for education and training providers</a>, for more information.</p>

<p>The statutory guidance for schools also contains further information about a policy statement that academies must publish to comply with section 42B of the Education Act 1997, known as the ‘provider access legislation’. The policy statement must set out the circumstances in which providers of technical education and apprenticeships will be given access to year 8 to 13 pupils.</p>

<h2>Complaints policy</h2>

<p>We recommend that all academies and colleges publish their complaints policy online.</p>

<p>If you’re an academy, <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> or sixth-form college, we recommend that you publish your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/whistleblowing">whistleblowing</a> policy online.</p>

<p>Academy schools (but not colleges or 16 to 19 academies) must, as part of their <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> information report, publish any arrangements for handling complaints from parents of children with special educational needs about the support provided by the school.</p>

<h2>Annual reports and accounts</h2>

More details are included in paragraph 2.32 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academy-trust-handbook">Academy Trust Handbook</a>.</p>

<h2>Trustees’ information and duties</h2>

<h3>Academies</h3>

<p>Academy trusts must publish accessible and up to date details of governance arrangements. Find more on what you need to publish about your academy and its board of trustees in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academy-trust-handbook">Academy Trust Handbook</a> (paragraphs 2.49 to 2.50).</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and sixth-form colleges</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the activities or cases where your school will charge pupils’ parents</li>
