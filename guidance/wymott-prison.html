<h2>Book and plan your visit to Wymott</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Wymott</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Wymott.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Wymott using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Wymott.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Wymott</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Wymott are given a list of approved items that can be sent to them as gifts. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Wymott</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>To send a book to a prisoner at HMP Wymott, the prisoner will submit an application form to the Operations team, this will then be approved and the prisoner will be informed. The prisoner will then inform their loved ones that the book can be sent in.</p>

<p>By waiting for the reply this will ensure that the staff at the gate have prior knowledge of any parcels being sent resulting in them being accepted.</p>

<p>Please note staff on the gate need to have prior knowledge of items being sent.</p>

<p>Prisoners can order books directly from the approved suppliers as outlined in Annex F.</p>
