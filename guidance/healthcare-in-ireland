<p>This information is about living in Ireland. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-ireland" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Ireland</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re a UK national, you may be entitled to state healthcare in Ireland on the same basis as an Irish citizen.</p>

<p>You may still need to pay a fee for some services. For example, there are charges for overnight hospital stays or A&E visits.</p>

<p>At the moment, UK nationals can access the healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with a medical card</li>
  <li>with a GP visit card</li>
  <li>buying private health insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>You may qualify for an Irish medical card because you live in Ireland and get funding from the UK, for example if you’re a UK State Pensioner, or because of how much you earn.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period">Healthcare during the transition period</h2>
<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals visiting or living in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Ireland or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Ireland as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency. This guidance explains what you need to do in Ireland depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-if-you-live-and-work-in-ireland">Healthcare if you live and work in Ireland</h2>
<p>You can get some state health services for free if you’re ‘ordinarily resident’ in Ireland. This means that you have lived or you intend to live in Ireland for at least a year. The amount you pay depends on how much you earn. You can apply for either a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>medical card (known as Category 1)</li>
  <li>GP visit card (known as Category 2)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not eligible for either of these, you’ll need to register as a private patient. This means you’ll pay the full cost of treatment.</p>

<p>You may need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.ie/en/service/12e6de-get-a-personal-public-service-pps-number/" class="govuk-link">get a Public Personal Service (PPS) number</a> before you can apply.</p>

<h3 id="medical-card">Medical card</h3>
<p>You can get some health services for free with a medical card. This is ‘means-tested’, which means it is based on your income.</p>

<p>You’ll also have to show evidence that you’re entitled to healthcare in Ireland. For example, proof that you own or rent a property.</p>

<p>With a medical card you’ll get the following services for free:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GP services</li>
  <li>state hospital services</li>
  <li>dental, optical and aural services</li>
  <li>maternity and infant care services</li>
  <li>community care and personal social services, such as public health nursing, home help and physiotherapy</li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/medical-card-application-process/what-a-medical-card-covers.html" class="govuk-link">Apply for a medical card</a></p>

<h3 id="if-you-dont-have-a-medical-card">If you don’t have a medical card</h3>
<p>You can apply for a GP visit card which will give you access to GP services for free. It does not cover other costs, such as overnight hospital stays or prescriptions.</p>

<p>You can apply for a GP visit card if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are ordinarily resident in Ireland</li>
  <li>cannot get a medical card</li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www2.hse.ie/services/gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards.html" class="govuk-link">Apply for a GP visit card.</a></p>

<h3 id="registering-with-a-gp">Registering with a GP</h3>
<p>If you have a medical card or GP visit card, you need to register with a <a rel="external" href="https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/gps-who-accept-medical-cards.html" class="govuk-link">doctor who accepts these cards</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not have either of these, you’ll have to register as a private patient. Private patients can register with any doctor, but you’ll be charged for GP services. A GP visit can cost €50.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/lholist.html" class="govuk-link">find local health services, including a GP, on the Health Service Executive (HSE) website</a>. You can also contact them by phone.</p>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Ireland or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Ireland as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>This means you may also be entitled to free state healthcare in Ireland if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="posted-worker">If your UK employer has sent you to Ireland temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad/posted-workers" class="govuk-link">posted worker</a> is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK but temporarily sent to another EEA country.</p>

<p>As a posted worker, you may be able to get healthcare paid for by the UK.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-youre-a-posted-worker">Healthcare during the transition period if you’re a posted worker</h3>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<h2 id="UK-funded">UK-funded healthcare in Ireland</h2>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Ireland and receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/medical-card-application-process/how-to-apply-for-a-medical-card.html" class="govuk-link">apply for a medical card</a> and provide proof that you’re eligible for UK-funded healthcare. This can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of your UK state benefit, for example your State Pension</li>
  <li>your driving licence</li>
  <li>your proof of residence</li>
  <li>your NHS Number</li>

<p>There is different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you’re a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020 if you receive free UK-funded healthcare in Ireland because you’re either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone with an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>someone with another ‘exportable benefit’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re living in Ireland or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Ireland as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>This means that you’ll get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continued access to free UK-funded healthcare in Ireland</li>
  <li>a UK-issued EHIC for travelling to other EU countries</li>
  <li>planned treatments in other EU countries via the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">S2 route</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="moving-back-to-the-uk">Moving back to the UK</h2>
<p>If you return to the UK permanently you will be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.

<h2 id="studying-in-ireland">Studying in Ireland</h2>

<ul>
  <li>driving licence</li>
  <li>proof of residence</li>
  <li>NHS Number</li>
  <li>UK-issued EHIC</li>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland until the end of 2020.</p>

<p>If you started studying in Ireland before the end of 2020, you’ll be entitled to healthcare on the same basis as an Irish citizen for the rest of the time you study there.</p>
