<h2>Why mapping updates are needed</h2>
<p>The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) needs to make sure that all land data on its systems is up to date. We do this by checking the digital maps and updating them if necessary.</p>

<h2>Information we use to check if an update is needed</h2>
<p>We check and update digital land maps using information from the latest available data sources. These include site visits (inspections) and land imagery such as aerial photography and Ordnance Survey map updates as well as information received from customers. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-we-map">What we map</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>How we notify you that we’ve updated a land parcel</h2>
<p>It’s important that you check your digital maps online because we regularly review and update our mapping information. If we update your land parcels, you will receive notifications in the ‘Messages’ tab in the Rural Payments service identifying which land parcels have been updated.</p>

<p>If you request a change to your digital maps, either by calling us or by sending an RLE1 form and sketch map to us, we will write to you. We will either confirm that we’ve made the changes you requested or we will explain why they cannot be made.</p>

<h2>When were digital land maps checked and updated?</h2>
<p>We carry out an annual review where we check, update and publish changes to digital land maps. These updates are usually made between December and February so that they are published before most customers start to apply for agri-environment schemes and/or the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).</p>

<p>If you request a change to your digital maps after the annual map updates have been completed, we need to check the information you give us. We will also check the latest information we hold to decide if your digital map needs to be updated further. We do this to make sure your digital maps are as up-to-date and accurate as possible.</p>

<h2>What you need to do</h2>
<p>It’s important that if you receive a notification through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a>, you check your digital land maps and land parcel details. It’s your responsibility to check your digital maps throughout the year and tell us if you do not agree with a change that we’ve made.</p>

<h2>Changes we’ve made</h2>

<h3>What we map</h3>
<p>We use digital maps to record physical land parcel boundaries and features for land parcels which will be included in applications and/or claims for some rural payments schemes. Find the list of these schemes and information on non-agricultural areas and features in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">RLE1 guidance</a>.</p>

<p>We define a land parcel as an area of land that is 0.0100 hectares or larger, and has physical boundaries.</p>

<p>Examples of physical boundaries are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hedges, walls, rivers, drains, ditches, roads</li>
  <li>obvious changes such as woodland next to grass</li>
  <li>watercourses if wider than 4 metres can sometimes be used as a boundary</li>
  <li>boundary stones and marker posts</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples that we do not accept as boundaries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>natural paths</li>
  <li>
    <p>temporary boundaries such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>temporary electric fences</li>
      <li>plough lines</li>
      <li>buffer areas between crops</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Split land parcels</h3>
<p>If a land parcel lies across a Less Favoured Area (LFA) boundary, we split the parcel in the digital map and record it as 2 separate parcels. The LFA boundaries are usually based on actual physical boundaries that are shown on Ordnance Survey maps. There are some exceptions to this.</p>

<h3>Merged land parcels</h3>
<p>We merge land parcels in the digital map when the permanent boundary is removed. 
We do not merge land parcels in the digital maps when the parcels are registered to different customers. In these cases the existing parcel boundaries in the digital map will not be changed.</p>

<h3>Land cover</h3>
<p>We record land cover in the digital maps but not land use. Land cover is not the same as land use. Land cover is a group of common land uses. There is one land use which has the same name as the land cover group – permanent grassland.</p>

<p>The table below shows the 4 land cover groups and some examples of the land uses in each group:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Land cover</th>
      <th scope="col">Land use</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Arable land</td>
      <td>Winter wheat - Spring barley - Temporary grassland</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Permanent grassland</td>
      <td>Permanent grassland</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Permanent crops</td>
      <td>Nursery crops - Short rotation coppice - Lavender</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Non-agricultural area</td>
      <td>Farm building - Structure - Woodland - Non-agricultural BPS eligible area (RD01)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Read the ‘Non-agricultural land under certain agri-environment or woodland scheme agreements’ section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-payments-land-use-codes-2022">Rural payments: land use codes 2022</a> for more information about non-agricultural BPS eligible areas.</p>

<h2>Order of the changes</h2>
<p>We only use information that is no more than one year old to carry out mapping updates. We review information from inspections and RLE1 forms as well as the latest land imagery. We decide if a digital map needs to be updated based on the latest information we hold.</p>

<h2>Where you can see the updates</h2>
<p>When you receive a mapping update notification through the Rural Payments service you need to check your digital maps so that you know what changes we’ve made. Using the Rural Payments service, you can see <a class="govuk-link" href="#digital-maps">digital maps</a> of all the land parcels registered to your holding.</p>

<h2>What you can expect to see</h2>
<p>Some of the updates may seem small and we appreciate that you may find this inconvenient. However, updates such as boundary changes, area changes or land cover changes can be important and can affect your agreements and/or payments.</p>

<p>In some cases, we may have to temporarily remove a feature to make the update. In these cases, a feature may disappear from the ‘View land’ screen temporarily, but it reappears when the update is made.</p>

<p>For more information about scheme rules or how the changes might affect agri-environment schemes or Forestry Commission (FC) legacy schemes read the relevant guidance on the following pages on GOV.UK:</p>

</ul>

<h2>How to check your digital land maps</h2>
<p>You can see digital maps of all the land parcels registered to your holding using the Rural Payments service</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk</a>.</li>
  <li>From the ‘Business overview’ screen, click ‘Land’ then ‘View land’.</li>
  <li>To view individual land parcel details select the land parcel you need. The ‘Parcel details’ screen shows you a digital map and details of the land parcel. There is also a ‘Photo’ option as well as the ‘Map’ option.</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all your land parcels are shown as linked to your SBI</li>
  <li>the permanent boundaries are shown correctly</li>
  <li>the land covers are shown correctly</li>
  <li>land has not been linked to your SBI by mistake</li>
</ul>

<p>Where we’ve made a change and you believe the map or any of the details are incorrect you can <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">call us</a>.</p>

<p>If we agree this is an error in the mapping work we will change it. If the mapping work is correct but you do not agree with the work we’ve done, you will need to follow the instructions <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-to-do">What to do if you do not agree with the updates</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe the map or the details are incorrect because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ve made changes to the land that are not shown in your digital maps</li>
  <li>you disagree with a change we’ve made</li>
</ul>

<p>you need to request a change to your digital maps read the information below.</p>

<p>If you are not sure why the change has been made, you can call us.</p>

<h3>How to check and change your hedge information</h3>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">Rural land and entitlements (RLE1) guidance</a> explains how to check the information that we hold about hedges on your land and what to do if you need to make changes.</p>

<h2>What to do if you do not agree with the updates</h2>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Requests for changes to your digital maps and land parcel details could affect payments you’ve already received as well as future payments. Only tell us about changes if you are sure they need to be made.</p>
</div>

<h3>RLE1 form</h3>
<p>You will need to use an RLE1 form to request most of the changes explained below. You can now download the RLE1 form, complete it electronically and return it to us as a PDF email attachment. If you are unable to do this, you can still print the RLE1 form, fill it in by hand and post it to us. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">RLE1 form and guidance</a> for more information about how to download and complete the RLE1 form electronically.</p>

<h3>Land parcels incorrectly linked to your holding</h3>
<p>You may have land that has been linked to your SBI by mistake. You can remove it from your holding (record) in the Rural Payments service using ‘remove’. The Rural Payments service must show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your holding type as ‘owner’, and</li>
  <li>100% of the land parcel as owned.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the Rural Payments service shows your holding type as ‘tenant’ or less than 100% of the land parcel as owned, and this information is incorrect, you need to download and fill in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-land-tenure-form">Change land tenure form</a> to correct the information. When the information is correct, you will be able to use the Rural Payments service to remove land from your holding (record).</p>

<p>If the Rural Payments service shows your holding type as ‘tenant’ or less than 100% of the land parcel as owned and this information is correct, you will need to call us and ask us to remove this land from your holding (record).</p>

<p>If you remove land from your holding record it will completely remove the land parcel from your record. This means you will not be able to claim for payment on that land parcel for either BPS or agri-environment and woodland schemes. So if you still control (for BPS it’s at your disposal and for other Rural Payment schemes it’s under your management control) the land parcel for one of these schemes, do not remove the land from your record.</p>

<h3>Land cover</h3>
<p>There are 2 ways you can tell us about changes to your land cover.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where there is only one land cover change and it covers the whole of the land parcel, you can call us.</li>
  <li>Where there is more than one land cover for a land parcel, you must fill in an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">RLE1 form</a> and send it to us with a sketch map clearly marked with the land covers and areas. If the land cover is non-agricultural, where possible write the land use code from Annex 1 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">RLE1 guidance</a> as this will help us record it correctly. You must also write ‘Mapping change query’ and your SBI on your RLE1 form and sketch map. If you fill in your RLE1 form electronically, you should state in your email that this is a mapping change query.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you want to tell us about several land parcels, each with only one land cover, it’s better to fill in an RLE1 form than to call us.</p>

<h3>Changes other than land incorrectly linked to your holding or land cover</h3>
<p>To tell us you do not agree with a change we’ve made you must fill in an RLE1 form and send it to us with relevant sketch maps. You can use the Rural Payments service to print maps of your land parcels. If you have a Farm Environment Record (FER) Map from Natural England, you can use a copy of this map. You must clearly write the RPA land parcel reference numbers on your FER Map as we cannot use the printed land parcel numbers. 
Information on how to mark changes on sketch maps and how to fill in an RLE1 form is given in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">RLE1 guidance</a>.</p>

<p>You must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>write on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">RLE1 form</a> and the sketch map ‘Mapping change query’  and your SBI then mark the changes you would like to make – read <a class="govuk-link" href="#do-I-need">Do I need to send any evidence with my RLE1 form and sketch maps?</a> for anything else that must be written on the sketch maps. If you fill in your RLE1 form electronically, you should state in your email that this is a mapping change query</li>
  <li>mark on the RLE1 form and sketch map what scheme this update relates to (include which scheme year), such as the Basic Payment Scheme 2022, a Countryside Stewardship 2023 application, an Environmental Stewardship 2022 claim. If you fill in your RLE1 form electronically, you should state in your email which scheme this update relates to</li>
  <li>add the land parcel you are querying on the RLE1 form and the ‘effective date of change’ - for BPS this is when the change was made on the ground, for CS or ES agreements read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-on-agri-environment-agreements-cs-and-es-and-bps">Guidance on agri-environment agreements (CS and ES) and BPS</a>. If you believe there has never been a change to the land parcel please use 31 December 2021 as the effective date.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding or changing hedges</h3>
<p>If you disagree with a length of hedge or hedge feature shown in your digital maps (or it’s not shown) you only need to send a completed RLE1 form and sketch map to us if you’re using hedges for any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applying to join the CS scheme and including BE3 (Management of hedgerows), BN5 (Hedgerow laying) or BN6 (Hedgerow coppicing)</li>
  <li>submitting a claim for BE3 (Management of hedgerows) against an existing CS agreement</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Hedges</h3>
<p>The RLE1 form does not form part of your BPS or CS application or your CS or ES claim. Therefore, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disagree with the information shown in your digital maps, and</li>
  <li>you believe it affects your BPS or CS application, or your CS or ES claim that you’ve submitted or intend to submit</li>
</ul>

<p>then you need to send us your RLE1 form and sketch maps as soon as possible, if you have not already done so.</p>
</div>

<h3>Do I need to send any evidence with my RLE1 form and sketch maps?</h3>
<p>You do not need to send any specific evidence with your RLE1 form and sketch maps. However, you need to be absolutely sure that the changes you request are necessary and correct. We use the latest developments in aerial photography so we may need further evidence from you and/or to check the land parcel before we accept the request for change.</p>

<p>If you believe that your request for changes is necessary then you need to send us your RLE1 form with your sketch maps.</p>

<p>To change a boundary, fill in the RLE1 form and send it with your sketch map clearly marked to show the boundary and write on what type of permanent boundary it is.</p>

<p>To add a non-agricultural area or feature, fill in the RLE1 form and send it with your sketch map clearly marked to show the non-agricultural area or feature. Write clearly on your sketch map what type of area or feature you want to add. Where possible, write the land use code from Annex 1 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">RLE1 guidance</a> (this will help us record the area or feature correctly).</p>

<p>To remove a non-agricultural area or feature, fill in the RLE1 form and send it with your sketch map. The sketch map should clearly show the non-agricultural area or feature with a cross marked through it. Write clearly on the map that you want to remove the area or feature.</p>

<p>To reverse where a land parcel has been split, fill in the RLE1 form and send it with your sketch map. Where you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have removed the permanent dividing boundary - clearly mark on your sketch map that the permanent boundary has been removed and write on your sketch map the date you removed it</li>
  <li>have removed a temporary dividing boundary – clearly mark on your sketch map  that the temporary boundary has been removed and write on your sketch map the start and end dates of the division</li>
  <li>do not agree with the boundary that has been mapped – clearly mark on your sketch map where the boundary actually is and explain why you do not agree with the new boundary on your map</li>
</ul>

<p>To reverse where a land parcel has been merged, fill in the RLE1 form and send it with your sketch map. Clearly mark on your sketch map the correct boundary and clearly write what type of boundary it is, such as marker posts or boundary stones.</p>

<p>There is not a deadline for sending your RLE1 form and sketch maps to tell us that you do not agree with a mapping change. We review every ‘Mapping change query’ RLE1 form that is received, however our focus is on making payments. This means depending on when you send your RLE1 form, it may take time to review your request.</p>

<p>Whether you’ve requested a change to your digital maps by calling us or by sending an RLE1 form and sketch maps to us, we will write to you. We will either confirm that we’ve made the changes you requested or we will explain why they cannot be made.</p>
