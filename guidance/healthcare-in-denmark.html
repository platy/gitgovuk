<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Denmark.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-denmark" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This information is about living in Denmark. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance about visiting Denmark.</a></p>

<p>Most state healthcare is free in Denmark if you’re a resident and have a state health insurance card (‘yellow health card’).</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Danish healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registering as a resident and getting a yellow health card</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">S1 form</a> with the Danish state healthcare system and getting a yellow health card</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Denmark</h2>
<p>You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-denmark#visas-and-residency" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> if you expect to live in Denmark for 3 months or more.</p>

<p>Everyone who’s a resident can also register for Danish state healthcare.</p>

<p>This is the same if you’re employed, self-employed or not working.</p>

<p>Your dependants need to register independently for healthcare. Children do not need to register independently until they’re 15 years old if a parent is registered, but they do need to have their own yellow health card.</p>

<p>Once you’re a resident, you may be entitled to a Danish <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>First, <a rel="external" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply" class="govuk-link">apply for a Residence Document</a>.</p>

<p>When you have your Residence Document you need to <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/theme/when-you-arrive" class="govuk-link">register at the Civil Registry of Denmark (CPR)</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll need proof of your address in Denmark and proof that you are staying for at least 3 months.</p>

<p>You choose your GP during your application to the CPR. When your CPR application is accepted, you’ll be sent a yellow health card.</p>

<p>The card will show the name and address of your doctor.</p>

<p>Always carry your yellow health card with you. Show it when you have a GP appointment.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>Most medical care is free, including GP appointments, hospital stays, mental health and long-term care.</p>

<p>You’ll still have to pay for some medical services. For example, dental check-ups cost around 200 Danish kroner.</p>

<p>Prescriptions are not free, but you’ll pay a maximum limit each year. <a rel="external" href="https://laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk/en/reimbursement/calculate-reimbursement/reimbursement-thresholds/" class="govuk-link">Find out how much you’ll pay towards prescribed medicines.</a></p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Denmark temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Denmark using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>.They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Denmark</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-denmark" class="govuk-link">Danish resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Denmark before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Danish system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Denmark on the same basis as a Danish citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Denmark than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>You must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Denmark</h3>

<p>Once you’re registered as a resident in Denmark, you’ll be issued with your yellow health card. This will mean you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Danish citizen.</p>

<p>You also need to register your S1 form with <a rel="external" href="https://www.borger.dk/Om-borger-dk/udbetaling-danmark" class="govuk-link">Udbetaling Danmark</a> (website in Danish).</p>

<h2>Studying in Denmark</h2>
<p>You can use an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<p>If you’re going to study in Denmark for 3 months or more, you’ll need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB/You-want-to-apply" class="govuk-link">register for residence as a student</a>.</p>

<p>When you have your Residence Document, you need to register at the <a rel="external" href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/theme/when-you-arrive" class="govuk-link">CPR</a> to get a yellow health insurance card.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
