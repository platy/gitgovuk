<h2>Travelling abroad during stay in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> restrictions</h2>

<p>Whilst the stay in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> restrictions are in place, you are only allowed to leave the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from England if you have a <a href="#permitted-reasons-for-international-travel" class="govuk-link">reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<p>This applies to holders of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and non-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passports.</p>

<p>It is illegal to travel abroad without a reasonable excuse. Travel abroad for holidays is not permitted.</p>

<h2>Rules and exemptions</h2>

<p>You must complete this form to declare the reason that you need to travel abroad, if you are travelling outside the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from England.</p>

<p>Different rules apply for international travel if you are departing from <a rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-travel-and-transport/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Scotland</a> or <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/foreign-travel-and-returning-home">Wales</a>.</p>

<p>It is illegal to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leave the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from England without a reasonable excuse</li>
  <li>be at an embarkation point where you can travel outside of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> (including airports, ferry terminals and international rail hubs) for the purpose of travelling out of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> without a reasonable excuse</li>
</ul>

<p>You could be fined for leaving, or trying to leave, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> without a reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>You may be required to show this declaration form at your port of departure, or on your way to your port of departure. You may carry evidence to support your reason for travel.</p>

<p>You do not need to complete the form yourself if you are under the age of 18 or if you lack capacity to complete the form. If a responsible adult is travelling with you, they must complete a separate copy of the form on your behalf.</p>

<p>Some people are exempt from completing the declaration form because of the job they do. Find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules">which jobs are exempt and the conditions that apply</a>.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Either print a copy of the form and carry it with you when you travel, or download it to your device. If you download it, make sure you can find it on your device so you can show it at your port of departure.</p>
</div>
