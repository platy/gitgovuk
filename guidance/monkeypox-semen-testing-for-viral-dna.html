<p>There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5652425/" rel="external">body of evidence</a> documenting the detection of <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> and <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> viruses in semen after acute infection. Monkeypox <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.22.2200421" rel="external"><abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> has been detected in semen up to day 11</a> after acute infection in men in Italy, although longitudinal sampling after this point was not carried out.</p>

<p>It remains unclear whether this is from seminal carriage as the testes are immunologically-protected sites (as with other viral infections such as Ebola virus disease), or from resolving meatal or urethral lesions that disappear as the skin lesions resolve.</p>

<p>However, in view of this, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-people-with-monkeypox-infection-who-are-isolating-at-home#resuming-sexual-activity">current <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> advice</a> takes a cautious approach and recommends that men who have been confirmed as a case of monkeypox should use condoms during sex for 12 weeks after complete recovery from monkeypox infection. This is in line with advice from the World Health Organization (<abbr title="world health organization">WHO</abbr>).</p>

<p>It should be recognised that there is currently no evidence to support this or any alternative advice.</p>

<p>Following the initial 12 weeks and up to 6 months after recovery from infection, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> therefore recommends performing a monkeypox <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> on semen samples (and where necessary, oropharyngeal and/or rectal swabs) if the patient:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is undergoing fertility treatment or planning pregnancy</li>
  <li>is undergoing planned semen storage (for example prior to chemotherapy)</li>
  <li>has an immunocompromised sexual partner (including a pregnant partner)</li>
  <li>is concerned about transmission to sexual partner or partners for any other reason and requests a test from their clinician</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing can also be offered on patient request following discussion with the local infection/genitourinary team and then with the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (<abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>).</p>

<p>A single negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> after 12 weeks post recovery is considered adequate, with recognition that this is based on expert opinion in the absence of a clear evidence base. It should also be noted that a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> does not necessarily indicate that the patient is potentially infectious, only that fragements of <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> have been detected.</p>

<p>However, since viral culture is not feasible for clearance testing, if the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is positive it is prudent to consider the patient potentially infectious: repeat samples should be submitted every 2 weeks thereafter, and the patient should continue to use condoms until a negative test result is obtained. Any samples sent without a minimum serial interval of 2 weeks will not be processed without prior discussion with <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any testing that is requested prior to 12 weeks post recovery must first be discussed and agreed with <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> prior to sending. Samples received without discussion will not be processed. For semen tested prior to 12 weeks post-recovery, 2 samples collected at least 48 hours apart should be tested, and both need to be negative to be deemed clear.</p>

<p>Sample collection must take place in a facility capable of arranging transport of a Category B sample. These are usually hospitals where cases of monkeypox are cared for and not genitourinary medicine (<abbr title="genitourinary medicine clinic">GUM</abbr>) clinics. Samples should be submitted in a universal sterile container and sent to:</p>

<p>High Containment Microbiology<br>
FAO Marian Killip / Matthew Jones<br>
<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Colindale<br>
61 Colindale Avenue<br>
London<br>
NW9 5EQ</p>

<p>Samples must be packaged and sent as a Category B infectious substance. Please ensure that samples are properly packaged and sealed. Leaking samples will not be processed. Samples will only be tested during working hours Monday to Friday.</p>

<p>Appropriate counselling from clinicians should include that this is an unvalidated diagnostic test.</p>

<p>It is expected that evidence will emerge for duration of monkeypox <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> detection in semen which will allow this guide to be updated, and earlier testing may be offered if the evidence supports this.</p>
