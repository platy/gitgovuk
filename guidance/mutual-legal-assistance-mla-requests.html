<p>Mutual legal assistance (<abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr>) is a method of cooperation between states for obtaining assistance in the investigation or prosecution of criminal offences. <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> is generally used for obtaining material that cannot be obtained on a police cooperation basis, particularly enquiries that require coercive means.</p>

<p>Requests are made by a formal international Letter of Request (<abbr title="Letter of Request">LOR</abbr>). In civil law jurisdictions these are also referred to as ‘Commission Rogatoire’. This assistance is usually requested by courts or prosecutors and is also referred to as ‘judicial cooperation’.</p>

<h2>Requesting <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> from the UK</h2>

<p>The UK provides a wide range of assistance.</p>

<p>The Home Office has produced detailed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mla-guidelines-for-foreign-authorities-2012"><abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> guidelines</a>, which are translated into French, Portuguese, Polish, Spanish and Turkish, for foreign authorities who wish to make a <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> request to the UK.</p>

<h3>Where to send your requests</h3>

<p>In the UK central authorities coordinate <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> requests.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> requests in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</h4>

<p>The UK Central Authority (UKCA) coordinates <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> requests in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, except for tax and fiscal customs criminal matters which are coordinated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). Information on making <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> requests relating to tax and fiscal customs matters is set out below.</p>

<p>The UKCA encourages requests by email, via secure channels of communication, to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:UKCA-ILOR@homeoffice.gov.uk">UKCA-ILOR@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>For requests relating to road traffic offences only, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:UKCA-RoadTrafficOffences@homeoffice.gov.uk">UKCA-RoadTrafficOffences@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>For requests relating to asset forfeiture and confiscation only, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:UKCA-AFC@homeoffice.gov.uk">UKCA-AFC@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>For requests relating to atrocity or war crimes only, contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:UKCA-AtrocityCrimes@homeoffice.gov.uk">UKCA-AtrocityCrimes@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The UKCA can provide a secure Egress link to enable transmission of  electronic documents to the UKCA which cannot be emailed. Please see our <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1054877/Egress_Instruction_Guide.pdf">guide to using Egress</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">285 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">3 pages</span>)</span>.</p>

<p>Where sending requests by email or through a secure Egress link is not possible, and if physical transmission is necessary, requests can be sent to the following postal address, ensuring these are clearly marked as Asset Forfeiture and Confiscation, Road Traffic Offences, War Crimes or <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr>, as applicable:</p>

<h3>Restraint and confiscation</h3>

<p>Requests for assistance in relation to restraint and confiscation should be made under the provisions of Title XI of Part 3 of the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement using the forms at Annex LAW-8.</p>

<p>Requests for cooperation under this part of the Agreement should be sent to the following central authorities:</p>

<h4>For England, Wales and Northern Ireland</h4>

<p>UK Central Authority
Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:UKCA-AFC@homeoffice.gov.uk">UKCA-AFC@homeoffice.gov.uk</a></p>

<h4>For tax matters and fiscal customs matters in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland</h4>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs 
Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:mla@hmrc.gov.uk">mla@hmrc.gov.uk</a></p>

<h4>For Scotland</h4>

<p>International Cooperation Unit, Crown Office
Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:coicu@copfs.gov.uk">coicu@copfs.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Service of process/procedural documents</h2>

<h4>Direct transmission of procedural documents</h4>
<p>Procedural documents may be sent directly by the requesting authority to the persons in the UK to whom they are addressed. Procedural documents should always be posted, unless this is not legally possible under the domestic law of the requesting authority.</p>

<h4>Requests for service of process/procedural documents</h4>

<p>A request may be made to the UK Central Authority or the Crown Office for the service of procedural documents (for example, a summons or judgment) issued by a court or authority in that state in relation to criminal proceedings.</p>

<p>HMRC is not a central authority for the purposes of the service of documents.</p>

<p>To enable service to take place please ensure the return date for summonses is at least 6 weeks from the date of receipt in the UK Central Authority to enable service to take place, otherwise the papers will be returned to the requesting state.</p>

<h2>Transfer of Proceedings</h2>
<p>The UK is not a signatory to the European Convention on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters and has a reservation under Article 21 of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.</p>

<p>Requests for transfer of proceedings will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mla-guidelines-for-foreign-authorities-2012"><abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>Requests for the exchange of criminal records</h2>

<p>EU Member States are able to exchange criminal record information directly with the United Kingdom via the UK’s Criminal Record Information System (UK-CRIS).</p>

<p>Title IX in Part 3 of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for the exchange of criminal records data between the UK and individual EU Member States through a shared infrastructure, supplementing Articles 13 and 22(2) of the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and its Additional Protocols.</p>

<p>The arrangements include streamlined and time-limited processes for exchanging criminal records information and specify that information can be exchanged for crime prevention and safeguarding purposes. Shared technical infrastructure is also in place meaning requests can still be made by EU Member States via ECRIS.</p>

<p>The UK has declared that the central authority to which requests for conviction information should be made is the ACRO Criminal Records Office (ACRO) – the UK Central Authority for the Exchange of Criminal Records. As such, European Union Member States should send requests for criminal records to ACRO as they did under the previous agreement.</p>

<h2>Civil cases</h2>

<p>Requests for mutual legal assistance to the UK relating to international civil and family law matters are dealt with separately.  Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mla-guidelines-for-foreign-authorities-2012"><abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>Requests for civil asset recovery</h2>

<p>Requests for the restraint or recovery of assets on a non-conviction (civil) basis (for example where it has not been possible to secure a conviction) can be made through <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> channels. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and related legislation provides a suite of investigative powers to enable agencies in the UK to secure evidence for the purposes of civil asset recovery.</p>

<p>This legislation also permits the UK to assist overseas authorities who request formal assistance for non-conviction based restraint and recovery. Requests for such assistance should be sent to the relevant central authority.</p>

<h2>Obtaining <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> from overseas</h2>

<p><abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> requests from the UK for evidence must be issued by a court or a designated prosecuting authority. A court may issue requests on behalf of the defence once proceedings have been instituted.</p>

<p>Courts and designated prosecuting authorities in the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Magistrates’ Courts, the Crown Courts and the High Court</li>
  <li>Attorney General for England and Wales</li>
  <li>Director of Public Prosecutions and any Crown Prosecutor</li>
  <li>Director and any designated member of the Serious Fraud Office</li>
  <li>Environment Agency</li>
  <li>Secretary of State for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills in respect of his function of investigating and prosecuting offences</li>
  <li>Secretary of State for Health</li>
  <li>Secretary of State for Transport</li>
  <li>Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</li>
  <li>District Courts and Sheriff Courts and the High Court of Justiciary</li>
  <li>Lord Advocate of Scotland</li>
  <li>Procurator Fiscal</li>
  <li>Attorney General for Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Financial Services Authority</li>
  <li>ACRO Criminal Records Office (ACRO)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Direct/indirect transmission</h3>

<p>The designated authorities listed above are able to send <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> requests to the relevant judicial authority in countries that have implemented the relevant sections (Article 15) of the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance, without the request going through a central authority in the UK. However, direct transmission from the UK is not possible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>requests for the transfer of a prisoner to appear in court or assist an investigation</li>
  <li>requests for bank account monitoring or customer information</li>
  <li>states where domestic legislation does not allow for it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case-handling arrangements in the UK Central Authority</h2>

<p>If accepted, a new request will be allocated to a caseworker who will write to the requesting authority to acknowledge receipt and introduce themselves as the point of contact on the case.</p>

<p>The caseworker will provide the UKCA reference number. This is specific to the individual case and should be quoted in all correspondence. Please direct all queries to the allocated caseworker in the first instance.</p>

<p>If the UKCA reference number is not known, please ensure sufficient details are provided to enable identification of the request. Please include the name of the subject of the request, the issuing authorities reference number and where applicable the operation name.</p>

<p>Please note that in the absence of a secure email link, the UKCA is unable to discuss personally identifiable details of a request by email.</p>

<h3>Returns and referrals</h3>

<p>If the UKCA considers that the letter of request does not contain enough information, it will either be returned to the requesting authority with the issues identified or a request for further information will be sent. When responding please ensure the identified issues raised by the UKCA have been addressed, and the UKCA reference number is provided.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, requests which should have been directed to HMRC or Crown Office and not the UKCA will be forwarded to them on behalf of the requesting authority.</p>

<p>Please note that failure to provide the fullest information possible in the letter of request may result in delays or in a request not being executed in whole or in part. Further details on where to send a <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> request and the required information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mla-guidelines-for-foreign-authorities-2012"><abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>The UKCA advises executing authorities to use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1064104/MLA_Closing_Report_Template_2022-v2.docx" rel="external"><abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> Evidential Closing Report</a>. When completed, this report will be sent to the relevant requesting authority together with the evidence gathered.</p>

<h4>De minimis requests</h4>

<p>The UK may refuse <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> requests considered de minimis. Information on the UK’s de minimis policy can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mla-guidelines-for-foreign-authorities-2012"><abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> guidelines</a>.</p>

<h3>Number of <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> requests received</h3>

<p>In the 2021 calendar year the UKCA received 6,365 incoming requests for <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> (13 of these requests were made through using the European Investigation Order) and 1,721 requests for service of process.</p>

<p>Please note that all figures are from local management information and have not been quality assured to the level of published National Statistics. As such they should be treated as provisional and therefore subject to change.</p>

<h2>Sending requests to the crown dependencies</h2>

<p>The Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories each have their own legal systems, independent of the UK. <abbr title="Mutual legal assistance">MLA</abbr> requests for the Crown Dependencies or the British Overseas Territories must be sent to the relevant Attorney General or equivalent. Do not send requests for the Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories to the Home Office.</p>
