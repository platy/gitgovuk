<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms for outgoing calls only so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Prisoner voicemail</h3>

<p>This service is used to exchange voicemails in a fast and easy way with your families, friends and loved ones. To use this service, please sign up on via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail website</a>.</p>
