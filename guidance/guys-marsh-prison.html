<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Guys Marsh</h2>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms for outgoing calls only so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Prisoner voicemail</h3>

<p>This service is used to exchange voicemails in a fast and easy way with your families, friends and loved ones. To use this service, please sign up on via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail website</a>.</p>
