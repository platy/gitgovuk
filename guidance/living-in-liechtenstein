<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/liechtenstein/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Liechtenstein</a>.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a> for further information.</p>

<h3 id="residency-and-visas-after-eu-exit">Residency and visas after EU Exit</h3>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this page as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Liechtenstein</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<p>You can look at our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/liechtenstein/">travel advice for Liechtenstein</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the Schengen area, including Liechtenstein</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in Liechtenstein and EU countries, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU Member State or Liechtenstein, you will be able to transit through the Schengen area to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You need to make sure you are correctly registered for healthcare as a resident in Liechtenstein. You can read the NHS guidance on who is able to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-liechtenstein/">access healthcare in Liechtenstein and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Liechtenstein, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Liechtenstein.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice</a> pages and advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">foreign travel insurance</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you live in Liechtenstein and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>The NHS has more information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-liechtenstein/">healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Liechtenstein</a>.</p>

<p>You can read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">the NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can find a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/switzerland-and-liechtenstein-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">list of medical facilities and practitioners</a> in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Liechtenstein.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK has now reached an agreement with the EEA EFTA states on citizens’ rights if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. This protects the rights of UK nationals living in the EEA EFTA states and EEA EFTA nationals living in the UK and will enable them to continue living their lives broadly as they do now.</p>

<p>Social security coordination is covered by our citizens’ rights agreements for those residing in Liechtenstein. Current healthcare arrangements will continue to apply in full to UK nationals who are resident in Liechtenstein before the UK leaves the EU, for as long as they reside in Liechtenstein. This includes students and S1 holders, but not those using an EHIC card as they are for temporary travel.</p>

<p>The UK is working to ensure UK issued EHIC cards will continue to be accepted in EEA EFTA states. However, this would not currently be the case in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. It is important that persons travelling always purchase comprehensive healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>You should read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-liechtenstein/">NHS guidance on healthcare for UK nationals in Liechtenstein and how it may change after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-liechtenstein">Working in Liechtenstein</h2>

<p>You should read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>, including Liechtenstein.</p>

<p>If you live abroad and require a police certificate from the UK, you can apply for one through the <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">ACRO Criminal Record Office</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-liechtenstein-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Liechtenstein after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/liechtenstein-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Liechtenstein to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a></li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/liechtenstein">paying income tax in Liechtenstein</a> by the European Union</li>
</ul>

<p>We strongly recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Liechtenstein. You can find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/switzerland-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyers in Liechtenstein</a>.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in Liechtenstein.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial service after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Liechtenstein. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Liechtenstein you can claim:</p>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK state pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">‘life certificate’ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay State Pension to those eligible after the UK leaving the EU. Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario here</a>.</p>

<p>The UK government will uprate your UK state pension for the fiscal year 2019/2020 in any scenario.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
