<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> national in Poland see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/poland/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

</ul>

<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Poland before 1 January 2021, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should check that you are correctly registered and should get a new residence document to evidence your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Poland before 1 January 2021, you should obtain a new residence document from your local Voivodeship Office. This document will evidence your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://udsc.gov.pl/kontakt-2/instytucje-wspolpracujace/instytucje-rzadowe/">check the locations of local Voivodeship Offices in Poland</a>.</p>

<p>Read the information and infographic about the process for obtaining the new residency documents on the <a href="https://udsc.gov.pl/en/brexit-stay-of-british-citizens-after-the-transition-period/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Polish governmentâ€™s guidance for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals</a>.</p>

<p>You should also read the <a rel="external" href="https://udsc.gov.pl/en/rules-of-stay-of-british-citizens-in-poland-after-brexit/" class="govuk-link">Polish Governmentâ€™s residency guidance for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals</a> and their <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://udsc.gov.pl/en/cudzoziemcy/brexit/faq/">frequently asked questions</a>.</p>

<p>If the authorities think you may be a Polish national, for example if you have Polish parents, grandparents or great grandparents, they might research your family history. Your application may take longer than usual to process.</p>

<h4>Additional support</h4>

<p>If you need additional support to complete your residency application, read the guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-support-fund-uknsf-applying-for-residency-in-eu-or-efta-countries" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Nationals Support Fund</a>.</p>

<h3>Moving to Poland</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/poland/entry-requirements">Check the entry requirements for Poland</a> and read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://udsc.gov.pl/en/cudzoziemcy/brexit/uk-nationals-coming-to-poland-from-1-january-2021/" rel="external">Polish governmentâ€™s guidance on moving to Poland</a>, including how to get a visa.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Poland. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>Read the Polish Border Guards <a href="https://www.strazgraniczna.pl/pl/aktualnosci/8885,Wielka-Brytania-poza-UE.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on what documents you should carry when travelling back to Poland to prove you are a resident</a> (in Polish).</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Poland, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Poland.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a>  before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Poland.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You will be able to travel to other <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Driving in Poland</h2>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licences are valid in Poland for the first 6 months of residence only. After 6 months, you must exchange your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licence for a Polish one. You do not need to retake a driving or theory test.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://powroty.gov.pl/prawo-jazdy-5285" class="govuk-link">Polish governmentâ€™s guidance on exchanging a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> driving licence for a Polish licence</a> (in Polish).</p>

<p>To exchange your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licence, the Polish authorities may ask you to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a sworn translation of your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> driving licence (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/poland-list-of-translators-and-interpreters/poland-list-of-translators">our list of translators</a> in Poland)</li>
  <li>proof of address in Poland</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on driving in Poland, read the information on:</p>

<p>When driving, you should always have your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>driving licence</li>
  <li>ID</li>
  <li>car registration papers</li>
  <li>insurance papers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Driving in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> with a Polish licence</h3>

<p>You can use your Polish licence in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for short visits, or exchange it for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licence without taking a test.</p>

<h3>Bringing a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-registered vehicle to Poland</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>You should read the European Unionâ€™s guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/taxes/index_en.htm" rel="external">car registration and taxes in Poland</a>. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so, you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must be registered for healthcare as a resident in Poland, and if necessary, with healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the Polish Ministry of Health <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.pl/web/zdrowie/informacja-nt-konsekwencji-uporzadkowanego-brexitu">guidance about the transition period and your healthcare rights in Poland</a>  (in Polish)</li>
  <li>read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-poland" class="govuk-link">our guidance on healthcare in Poland</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances</li>
</ul>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> if you live in Poland and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are receiving a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pension</li>
  <li>are receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>are a frontier worker who lives in Poland and commutes to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have been sent to Poland temporarily by your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> employer</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-poland#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on using an S1 form in Poland</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) and Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Poland, you must not use your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC for healthcare in Poland, unless you are a student or a detached (posted) worker. Current EHICs will remain valid until the expiry date on the card.</p>

<p>If you are living in Poland you may be eligible for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> student in Poland</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p>The card you receive will depend on when you moved to Poland.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start">Apply now for a new <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC</a>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or GHIC  is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h3>Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>Youâ€¯mayâ€¯need to get your professional qualification recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated inâ€¯Poland.â€¯When doing this, you will be subject to the third country regulations.</p>

<p>Read the Department for International Tradeâ€™s guidance on how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/poland-providing-services-after-eu-exit#recognition-of-professional-qualifications">get your qualification recognised in Poland</a> and sign up for their updates.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>
