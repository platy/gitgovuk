<h2>Reporting events and making payments on charges arising from your event report</h2>

<p>If a reportable event occurs within a tax year, you must submit your event report by 31 January following the end of the tax year when the event occurred. If a scheme has been wound up you must submit the event report within 3 months of the date the scheme wound up or by the 31 January deadline, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>If the event that you’ve reported is an unauthorised payment, HMRC will also raise an assessment for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pension-schemes-and-unauthorised-payments#paying-the-scheme-sanction-charge">scheme sanction charge</a>. The amount of the scheme sanction charge depends on whether the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pension-schemes-and-unauthorised-payments">unauthorised payments charge</a> has been paid either by the member or by the scheme administrator if the member has agreed to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pension-schemes-and-unauthorised-payments#paying-tax-due-on-unauthorised-member-payments">mandating procedure</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll have 30 days from the date we issue the assessment notice, to pay the scheme sanction charge, if you have not already done so. Late payment penalties become payable if the tax still has not been paid 30 days after the due date.</p>

<p>Interest will be charged if the scheme sanction charge is not paid by 31 January following the tax year in which the charge arose.</p>

<p>To avoid or minimise interest being charged scheme administrators can make payments on account.</p>

<p>If the member has completed and signed the mandate, you’ll also be required to pay the unauthorised payments charge on their behalf.</p>

<p>If you need to give your bank HMRC’s banking address it is:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Barclays Bank plc
<br>1 Churchill Place
<br>London
<br>United Kingdom
<br>E14 5HP
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>If you’re the manager of an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/overseas-pension-schemes">overseas pension scheme</a> you should contact HMRC before paying the overseas transfers charge.</p>

<h3>The Government Banking Service</h3>

<p>Employers such as government departments and health authorities who have a Government Banking Service account can pay using the Government Banking Service online service.</p>

<p>If you enter HMRC’s Government Banking Service account details incorrectly there may be a delay updating your record, or your payment may not reach HMRC.</p>

<p>As long as you make a payment by the Government Banking Service deadline it will reach HMRC on the same day.</p>

<h3>Online debit or corporate credit card</h3>

<p>You can pay by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.tax.service.gov.uk/pay-online/other-taxes" rel="external">debit or corporate credit card</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a non-refundable fee if you pay by corporate credit or corporate debit card.</p>

<p>There’s no fee if you pay by personal debit card.</p>

<p>You cannot pay by personal credit card.</p>

<p>If you’re unable to make full payment by credit or debit card you’ll have to pay a different way.</p>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="#find-ref">what reference to use if you’re making a payment</a>.</p>

<p>Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.</p>

<p>HMRC will accept your payment on the date you make it and not the date it reaches HMRC’s account, including on bank holidays and weekends.</p>

<h3>Making a card payment — getting your details correct</h3>

<p>We have recently made some changes as part of HMRC’s commitment to making sure the security of online payments. You need to make sure the details you are entering are correct and match those held by your bank or card provider, for example, the billing address should be the one to which your card is currently registered.</p>

<h3>At your bank or building society</h3>

<p>You’ll need to order a payslip from HMRC to pay this way. It can take up to 10 days to arrive. Use another method if you need to pay before then.</p>

<p>You can order a payslip by writing to HMRC.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Pension Schemes Services
<br>HM Revenue and Customs
<br>BX9 1GH 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Use the payslips to pay at your own bank or building society. You can pay by cash or cheque made payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’ and write your reference number on the back of the cheque. You can find more information about what reference to use if you’re making a payment in this guide.</p>

<p>Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.</p>

<p>HMRC will accept your payment on the date you make it and not the date it reaches HMRC’s account, if you pay between Monday and Friday.</p>

<h3>By cheque through the post</h3>

<p>You’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="#payslips">order a payslip</a> from HMRC to pay this way. It can take up to 10 working days for them to arrive. Use another method if you need to pay before then.</p>

<p>Make your cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’.</p>

<p>Write your reference number on the back of the cheque. You can find more information about what reference to use if you’re making a payment in this guide.</p>

<p>Do not fold the payslip or cheque and do not fasten them together.</p>

<p>You should allow 3 working days for your payment to reach HMRC. Send your cheque to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

HM Revenue and Customs
<br>Direct
<br>BX5 5BD
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You do not need to include a street name, city name or PO box with this address.</p>

<p>If you’re sending your payment by post, you can include a letter to ask for a receipt from HMRC.</p>

<h2>What reference to use if you’re making a payment</h2>

<h3>Accounting for Tax</h3>

<p>If you submit your Accounting for Tax return through the Pension Schemes Online service, your 14-character charge reference will be on your online receipt. You should use this when making Accounting for Tax payments.</p>

<p>If you submit your Accounting for Tax return through the Managing Pension Schemes service, you can find your charge reference and other financial information in the ‘payments and charges’ screen for each return you have submitted.</p>

<h3>Event report</h3>

<p>If you need to make a payment following the submission of an event report email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pensions.businessdelivery@hmrc.gov.uk">pensions.businessdelivery@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll tell you how you can pay the charges.</p>

<h3>Payments on account</h3>

<p>You should use a charge reference when making a payment so we can make sure the payment is properly allocated.</p>

<h3>Incorrect references</h3>

<p>Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.</p>
