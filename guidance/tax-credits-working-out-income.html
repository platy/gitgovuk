<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When you claim tax credits, you’ll need to give details of your total income. You’ll also need to work out your income when you renew your tax credits each year.</p>

<p>Usually, what you’re entitled to is based on your income for the last tax year (6 April one year to 5 April the next).</p>

<p>Your income includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wages as an employee, including any ‘employer benefits’ you might have had</li>
  <li>other income, like interest on savings or pensions</li>
  <li>money from state benefits unless they’re <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/taxable-income/taxfree-state-benefits">‘tax free’ benefits</a>
</li>
  <li>money from employment including if you cannot work your normal hours but you’re still getting paid (‘on furlough’)</li>
  <li>your profits and earnings if you’re self-employed</li>
  <li>some <a class="govuk-link" href="#coronavirus-payments">payments relating to coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> that you may have received</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not include income from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/test-and-trace-support-payment">Test and Trace Support Payment</a> you got because you needed to self-isolate due to coronavirus</li>
  <li>the one-off £500 payment for working households receiving tax credits</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide tells you how to work out your wages, self-employment income and other income.</p>

<h2>Income from employment</h2>

<p>There are 3 steps to working out your total income.</p>

<h3>Step 1: work out your gross pay</h3>

<p>This is your total wages from all jobs you had in the last tax year, before any tax and National Insurance deductions. If you have had certain employee benefits you’ll need to add these in, as well as any tips or strike pay.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your employer should have given you a record of your gross pay on a P60 or P45 if you left before the end of the tax year. If you do not have a P60 or P45, check your final payslip, which should show your total pay to date.</p>
</div>

<p>Add up any of the following that apply to you, to get your total gross pay.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Add up these amounts</th>
      <th scope="col">Notes</th>

<p>You can use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exchange-rates-for-customs-and-vat">HMRC exchange rate tables</a> to work out earnings from outside the UK.</p>

<h3>Step 2: what to take off your gross pay</h3>

<p>You can use this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-credits-income-working-sheet-tc825">working sheet</a> to work out your pension contributions or Gift Aid.</p>

<h3>Step 3: what you have left</h3>

<p>Take the step 2 total from the step 1 total to get your total income.</p>

<p>This figure is your ‘earnings as an employee from all jobs’.</p>

<h2>Employer benefits</h2>

<p>When you work out your gross pay as an employee, you need to include the taxable value of certain benefits you received from your employer.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your employer will give you a P11D form which will tell you the taxable value of any benefits you received.</p>
</div>

<p>Form P9D and the £8,500 earnings limit were abolished from 6 April 2016. Form P9D only relates to tax year 2015 to 2016 and earlier.</p>

<p>Add up any of the following that apply to you, to work out what to include in your gross pay.</p>

      <th scope="col">Add up these amounts</th>
      <th scope="col">Where to find the amount on your P11D</th>

<h2>Income from self-employment</h2>

<p>There are 3 steps to working out your income from self-employment.</p>

<h3>Step 1: work out your profit</h3>

<p>Your profit is what you gave on your Self Assessment tax return for the last tax year. If you had more than one business, add up all of the separate business profits.</p>

<p>If you have not filled in your tax return, you’ll need to estimate your profit.</p>

<h3>What else to include</h3>

<p>Make sure your profit includes other income or profits your business received, for example rental income from a flat above a shop. Do not include this as ‘other income’ too.</p>

<p>Include any profit from working outside the UK, in British pounds. To work this out, use the average exchange rate for the last tax year. This will be the average exchange rate for the year to 31 March. Use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exchange-rates-for-customs-and-vat">HMRC exchange rate tables</a>.</p>

<p>You can get help with working out your profit by contacing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-helpline">Self Assessment helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>Step 2: what to take off your profit</h3>

<p>To work out what to take off your profit, add up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the gross amount of any personal pension payments</li>
  <li>any trading losses from the same business you brought forward from a previous year</li>
  <li>the gross amount of any donations to charity using Gift Aid</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-credits-income-working-sheet-tc825">working sheet</a> you can use to work out your pension contributions, Gift Aid or trading losses.</p>

<h3>Step 3: what you have left</h3>

<p>Take the step 2 total from the step 1 total, to get your income from self-employment.</p>

<p>If you made a loss, your ‘income from self-employment’ for tax credit purposes is 0.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You may offset any losses that you have made in this year only, against any other household income for this year.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you’ve just started out and your business had no income in the last tax year, leave ‘income from self-employment’ blank.</p>
</div>

<h2>Coronavirus payments</h2>

<p>For example, if your whole pension is worth £60,000, you can take up to £15,000 as a tax-free lump sum.</p>

<p>You do not need to include the tax-free £15,000 as income for tax credits.</p>

<h3>Income from trusts, settlements and estates</h3>

<p>You can get the figure from form R185 that the trustees or administrators will have given you. Include the amount before any tax was taken off (add together the ‘net’ amounts and ‘tax paid’ or ‘tax credit’ amounts).</p>

<h3>Foreign income</h3>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>income from investments and property overseas</li>
  <li>social security payments from abroad</li>
  <li>foreign pensions</li>
</ul>

<p>Include the gross amount, before any tax, whether or not it came into the UK.</p>

<p>You should include any foreign income in British pounds. You can take off any banking charge or commission paid when converting foreign currency.</p>

<p>To convert foreign income into British pounds, use the average exchange rate for the last tax year. This will be the average exchange rate for the year to 31 March. You can use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exchange-rates-for-customs-and-vat">HMRC exchange rate tables</a>.</p>

<h3>Notional income</h3>

<p>Notional income is income that you’re treated as having which you may not in fact have.</p>

<h3>Income to include in full</h3>

<p>You should include the following income amounts in full (do not deduct £300):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adult Dependants’ Grant paid to students with a partner or a dependent adult</li>
  <li>dependants’ grants for students in Scotland</li>
  <li>taxable miscellaneous income, for example copyright royalties paid to you for a book when you’re not a professional author</li>
</ul>

<h3>What not to include</h3>

<p>Do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintenance payments received from a former partner</li>
  <li>tax credits payments</li>
  <li>student loans</li>
  <li>student grants, except the Adult Dependants’ Grant or any dependants’ grant in Scotland</li>
  <li>income your children have had, unless it’s taxable in your or your partner’s name</li>
  <li>any payments received through a disguised remuneration or loan charge scheme</li>
</ul>

<h3>Working out your total other income</h3>

<p>To get the final figure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add up all the amounts to include over £300 — add up the full amounts, then take £300 away</li>
  <li>then add in all the amounts to include in full</li>
</ul>

<p>If you end up with a minus figure, your ‘other income’ for tax credit purposes is 0.</p>
