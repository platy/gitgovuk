<p>In exceptional circumstances, where you are unable to this, please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Excise Helpline</a> for advice.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Ships</h4>

<p>If you’re drawing back the excise duty paid on heated heavy oils, you need to make your claim in standard litres. A standard litre is a litre of oil at a temperature of 15°C and a pressure of 1013.25 millibars.</p>

<p>You may need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculate the volume from weight</li>
  <li>convert litres to standard litres</li>
</ul>

<p>To work out the density and temperature, use a method recommended by the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Institute of Petroleum</li>
  <li>Standardisation of Tar Products Tests Committee</li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot accept claims based on notional factors. We recommend using tables from the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>American Society for Testing Materials</li>
  <li>Institute of Petroleum</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.1.2 Aircraft</h4>

<p>If you’re making a claim for light oil, you should submit your claim on the same basis that the duty was charged.</p>

<h3>2.2 Reason for rejecting a claim</h3>

<p>A claim will not be processed, and will be returned to you if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have not converted to litres</li>
  <li>it does not have an original signature</li>
  <li>we received it outside the time limits (see paragraph 2.3)</li>
  <li>the claim is incomplete</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember when you claim excise duty drawback, you cannot claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before you pay the duty</li>
  <li>more duty than you originally paid</li>
  <li>if you’re claiming duty relief under any other scheme</li>
  <li>for any part of a journey within the UK before you leave for a destination outside it</li>
  <li>on any flight where the aircraft does not land abroad</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3 Time limits for making claims</h3>

<p>If an event triggers a drawback claim (such as export or destruction) you must claim within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 years of the date you originally paid that duty</li>
  <li>2 years of the date of the event giving rise to the claim</li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot pay claims submitted outside these time limits.</p>

<h3>2.4 If you export duty paid oils as stores</h3>

<p>You do not need to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> that you intend to do this. A ‘Notice to pack’ is not required. We may inspect, sample, and test oil.</p>

<h2>3. Evidence for claiming drawback</h2>

<h3>3.1 Information your supplier should provide</h3>

<p>For each consignment you receive, your supplier should provide you with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accurate statements of the proportion of duty paid oil</li>
  <li>the rate of duty they paid</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 If you manufacture or deal in oil</h3>

<p>For each consignment that you send out, you should supply your customers with accurate statements of the proportion of duty paid oil, and the rate of duty that was paid.</p>

<p>If you’re claiming drawback, you must keep detailed records of the receipt and use of mineral oil. Your records must show the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name and address of the person who sold the oil to you</li>
  <li>description of the oil</li>
  <li>quantities used</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Provide evidence of loading or shipment</h3>

<p>If you are using oils as stores you will need the following evidence.</p>

<p>You need an order which must show that the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ship, or aircraft, is entitled to duty free stores for the journey in question</li>
  <li>owner, master, commander, or duly authorised agent of that craft placed the order</li>
</ul>

<p>You need a receipt which must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be signed by a responsible officer</li>
  <li>be validated by the ship’s stamp or other agreed form of authentication</li>
  <li>carry a statement confirming you’re entitled to duty free stores (normally a pre-printed statement on the delivery note)</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need invoices and delivery notes.</p>

<p>Use these as supporting evidence (where possible) if you’re submitting individual claims on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-claim-for-drawback-of-duty-paid-on-oils-used-as-fuel-on-foreign-going-aircraft-ho60">form HO60</a>. We’ll only return them to you if you request it.</p>

<h3>3.4 If the duty rates changes</h3>

<p>This will normally happen at Budget time, and you can then choose one of two options:</p>

<p>(a) Keep separate physical stocks and records, clearly showing which duty rate was paid upon which stocks. Your claims must clearly state which rate is being used.</p>

<p>(b) Maintain a ‘stock exhaustion account’. This should show the volume of oil held at Budget time. You should submit drawback claims at the pre-Budget rate until that oil stock has been exhausted. Your claims should clearly show the duty rate used.</p>

<p>If the excise duty rate reduces, you must claim at the lower rate of excise duty, after the date the lower rate comes into force.</p>

<h3>3.5 Records you should keep</h3>

<p>As a revenue trader, you must follow the Revenue Trader (Accounts and Record) Regulations 1992. More information is in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records">Excise Notice 206: revenue trader’s records</a>). As a drawback trader, you must be able to show that the oils:</p>

<ul>
  <li>had excise duty applied at the rate claimed</li>
  <li>have been loaded as stores</li>
  <li>will not be subject to a claim for relief of excise duty under any other scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>You must keep your records for at least 6 years. If this causes you problems, speak to an <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> officer. You may keep your records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on microfilm or microfiche, so long as they are legible, and you provide the necessary facilities to read the records</li>
  <li>on a computer</li>
</ul>

<p>Our auditing officers will need access to the appropriate technical documentation at the time of their visit.</p>
