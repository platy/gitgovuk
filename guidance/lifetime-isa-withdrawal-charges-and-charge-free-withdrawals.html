<h2>When investors can withdraw funds</h2>

<p>Investors can access their Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> funds at any time subject to the accounts terms and conditions set by their <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility as a Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager to calculate and deduct the correct withdrawal charge from funds withdrawn from a Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr>. You can ask HMRC for advice about withdrawal charges when funds are withdrawn from an account.</p>

<p>An investor should be able to withdraw their Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> savings and investments within 30 days of an instruction to their <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager. These rules do not apply to withdrawals for a first time residential purchase.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-manage-an-isa-investment-fund#withdrawals-from-an-isa">managing withdrawals from an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>When you can make a charge-free withdrawal</h2>

<p>Withdrawals that are not subject to a withdrawal charge include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for first time residential purchases</li>
  <li>when an investor has reached the age of 60 — any subsequent growth or interest earned by their Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> will continue to be tax free</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-a-lifetime-isa-when-an-investor-dies-or-is-terminally-ill">death or terminal illness of the investor</a>
</li>
  <li>payments removed from an invalid account</li>
  <li>management fees charged by, and paid directly to an <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager in line with its terms and conditions</li>
  <li>when a Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager is declared in default by either the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)</li>
  <li>an act, omission or circumstance not caused by an investor</li>
  <li>recoupment and repayment of an incorrect government bonus to HMRC</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you need to make a withdrawal charge</h2>

<p>Any amount withdrawn from a Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> that is not the result of a life event is subject to a 25% withdrawal charge. You should deduct this from the funds withdrawn by the investor.</p>

<p>In limited circumstances it is not possible to apply the withdrawal charge before the withdrawal has taken place. For example, if the amount withdrawn was for a house purchase that later failed but the funds were not returned to the Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> withdrawal charge must be applied retrospectively. In these circumstances, if the withdrawal amount is £4,000, the withdrawal charge is one third of the total amount withdrawn. The withdrawal charge due will be £1,333.33. This is 25% of £5,333.33, which would allow for the net withdrawal of £4,000.</p>

<h2>After making a withdrawal</h2>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify HMRC of a withdrawal from a Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr>, and any withdrawal charges that are due to HMRC, on the same monthly claim</li>
  <li>pay the withdrawal charge into a non-<abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> account, such as a control account, held by the Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager until it’s collected by HMRC</li>
  <li>make payment of withdrawal charges to HMRC no later than 28 days after the end of the claim period in which the chargeable withdrawal occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>A claim period runs from the sixth day of a month to the fifth day of the next calendar month.</p>

<p>When an investor makes a withdrawal but a charge was not applied, and it should have been, HMRC must receive an amount equal to the withdrawal charge.</p>

<p>When a withdrawal charge is due both the investor and you are jointly and severally liable for the charge due.</p>

<p>You are liable when they hold enough funds in an investor’s account to cover the payment of the withdrawal charge due.</p>

<p>You can legally remove these funds from their investor’s account.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-reporting-for-lifetime-isas#hmrcs-processing-of-bonus-claims-and-withdrawal-charges">HMRC’s processing of withdrawal charges</a>.</p>

<h2>When an investor appeals a withdrawal charge</h2>

<p>An investor can make a written request to you for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a statement giving details of the gross amount of the withdrawal</li>
  <li>the amount of charge deducted</li>
  <li>the net amount actually paid</li>
</ul>

<p>You must provide this statement within 30 days from the day after receiving the written request from the investor.</p>

<p>Where an investor considers that a withdrawal charge has been wrongly made, they can apply to HMRC for a refund within 4 years. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>after investors notify you that they have a terminal illness</li>
  <li>the transfer of funds between Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Accounts">ISAs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>where funds are not returned to a Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> after the failure of a first time residential purchase</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to support the investor’s application. HMRC will notify the investor directly of its decision.</p>

<p>If an investor’s application is successful, HMRC may instruct the Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> manager to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reverse a withdrawal charge that they’ve applied</li>
  <li>amend their Lifetime <abbr title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</abbr> claim for the month</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot reverse a withdrawal charge that was wrongly made without an instruction from HMRC.</p>

<p>HMRC can collect charges that remain due but unpaid at the end of the period described above in the same way as tax charged on a formal tax assessment.</p>
