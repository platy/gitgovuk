<h2 id="rules-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Rules after the UK leaves the EU</h2>

<p>Use this guidance to understand what will and will not change if you’re exporting from the UK to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EU member states</li>
  <li>non-EU member states (third countries)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exports-to-the-eu-from-the-uk">Exports to the EU from the UK</h2>

<h3 id="animals-products-of-animal-origin-fish-shellfish-crustaceans-germplasm-or-fishery-products">Animals, products of animal origin, fish, shellfish, crustaceans, germplasm or fishery products</h3>

<p>To transport animals, products of animal origin (<abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>), fish, shellfish, crustaceans, germplasm or fishery products from the UK to the EU in the event of no deal, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <a href="#ehc">export health certificate</a> (<abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr>), which you need to apply for in advance</li>
  <li>to understand the purpose and requirements of an <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> and any accompanying documentation</li>
  <li>to have your <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> signed by an authorised signatory following an inspection of your consignment</li>
  <li>to ensure the trade route for your goods allows for your consignment to be checked at a <a href="#bips">border inspection post (<abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr>)</a> at the first EU country you enter for export</li>
  <li>to make sure your EU-based import agent has notified the <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr> that your consignment is arriving at least 24 hours in advance</li>
  <li>to comply with wider <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/partnership-pack-preparing-for-a-no-deal-eu-exit"><abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> guidance</a> on customs requirements for exporting to the EU</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="animal-by-products-not-for-human-consumption">Animal by-products not for human consumption</h3>

<p>To export animal by-products not for human consumption, depending on the type, you will need one of the following in advance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <a href="#ehc"><abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>a model declaration form for certain products - download and complete <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates/export-intermediate-products-to-be-used-for-the-manufacture-of-medicinal-and-cosmetic-products-intended-for-dispatch-to-or-for-transit-through-the-european-union-certificate-8341">certificate 8341 for products used for medicines and cosmetics</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates/export-untreated-wool-and-hair-to-the-european-union-certificate-8343">certificate 8343 for untreated wool and hair</a>
</li>
  <li>official documentation, which you must get from the competent authority of the EU member state where your consignment is going</li>
</ul>

<p>All animal by-products must go through a <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr>. Your EU-based import agent must notify the <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr> in advance that the consignment is arriving.</p>

<p>Check if your animal by-product’s Combined Nomenclature (CN) code is <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32007D0275">listed as required to undergo vet checks</a> at a <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr>. If your animal by-product does not require vet checks at a <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr>, make sure that your EU-based import agent has found out the correct notification procedure from the competent authority of the EU member state that your consignment is going to.</p>

<h2 id="ehc">
<abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> applications</h2>

<p>To start the <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> or declaration application process use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates"><abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> form finder</a> on GOV.UK or contact your local authority. Most <abbr title="Export health certificates">EHCs</abbr> also have guidance documents telling you how to fill out the certificate.</p>

<p>To make your application, you’ll need to follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Find the <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> and other relevant documentation on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates"><abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> form finder</a>. If you’re exporting from Northern Ireland, contact your local <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact">Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs</a> (<abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr>) office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nominate an authorised signatory to inspect your product. There are various ways you can find one:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-a-professional-to-certify-export-health-certificates">list of professionals who can sign <abbr title="Export health certificates">EHCs</abbr></a> on GOV.UK</li>
      <li>ask at your local vet</li>
      <li>email <a href="mailto:csconehealthovteam@apha.gov.uk">csconehealthovteam@apha.gov.uk</a> (if you’re in Northern Ireland contact <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact"><abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr></a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fill in the <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> and supporting forms and email them to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) address provided in the forms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will send your <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> to your nominated authorised signatory within 7 working days or within 1 working day if you plan to export in the next 7 working days. Exporters of perishable fishery products should contact their authorised signatory to discuss specific needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authorised signatory will check the product meets the health requirements of the destination country, and complete and sign the <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr>. The completed <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> will go with the product, and the authorised signatory will send a copy to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There’s no fee for the certificate but you may be charged by your vet or authorised signatory for their time.</p>

<p>If you cannot find the <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> you need, contact <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening"><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> (or <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact"><abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr></a> in Northern Ireland).</p>

<h3 id="exports-to-non-eu-countries-third-countries-from-the-uk">Exports to non-EU countries (third countries) from the UK</h3>

<p>It is anticipated that there’ll be no change to current export rules and processes for countries outside the EU.</p>

<p>However, exporters should check they are using the latest version of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates"><abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr></a> for each particular destination. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-live-animals-special-rules">existing guidance on exporting live animals</a>.</p>

<p>Consignments destined for non-EU countries that transit the EU will either need an EU Transit Certificate if available or will need to be accompanied by an <abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> for the destination that will be the EU <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr> of exit. EU Transit Certificates can be found on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates"><abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr> finder</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bips">Border and customs offices</h2>

<p>Goods will only be able to enter the EU through a <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr> designated for the specific consignment.</p>

<p>At the moment there is no <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr> in Calais. <abbr title="Border inspection posts">BIPs</abbr> are under construction with the intention of the French authorities to be operational by the end of March.  You should check <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/vet-border-control/bip_en">the list of existing <abbr title="Border inspection posts">BIPs</abbr> in the EU</a> and consider how to redirect your trade route if necessary.</p>

<p>You should contact your import agent in the EU to ensure that they notify the <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr> through the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (<abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>) of the arrival of their consignment. An EU <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr> requires notice 24 hours in advance.</p>

<h3 id="uk-application-for-third-country-status-and-listing-for-live-animals-germplasm-poao-and-animal-by-product-exports">UK application for third country status and listing for live animals, germplasm, <abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr> and animal by-product exports</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission will vote again on whether to list the UK as a ‘third country’ and allow exports of animals and animal products to continue from the UK.</p>

<p>Because the EU has previously accepted the UK as a listed third country, we expect the UK will continue to meet the requirements for ‘third country’ status.</p>

<h3 id="eu-listing-for-exporters-and-suppliers">EU listing for exporters and suppliers</h3>

<p>If you’re a UK establishment that does either of the following, you’ll need to be listed with the EU:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exports <abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>, some live animals (for example zoo animals), germplasm and animal by-products direct to the EU</li>
  <li>supplies other UK establishments that export these goods to the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>The European Commission has confirmed that the current list of UK animal by-product-registered or approved premises will be accepted. These premises will continue to be listed with the EU for the purpose of exporting animal by-products to the EU. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) is preparing to confirm the list of these establishments with the EU.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> is preparing to submit a list of establishments that want to export commodities other than animal by-products to the EU. Establishments can provide information and ask to be listed by emailing <a href="mailto:eulistings@food.gov.uk">eulistings@food.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="documents-for-transporters">Documents for transporters</h2>

<p>Documents issued by the UK will only be valid in the UK and not in EU countries.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prepare-to-drive-in-the-eu-after-brexit-lorry-and-goods-vehicle-drivers">Department for Transport guidance</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you’re a UK transporter, transporting live animals in the EU, you’ll need to appoint a representative within an EU country. You’ll need to apply to the relevant government department to get a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transporter authorisation</li>
  <li>certificate of competence</li>
  <li>vehicle approval certificate</li>
  <li>journey log (where necessary)</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to apply for a journey log from the first EU country you enter for export and <a href="#bips">show this at a <abbr title="Border inspection post">BIP</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2 id="other-requirements">Other export requirements</h2>

<p>Before exporting, businesses must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register for an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eori">Economic Operator Register and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Register and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number</a>
</li>
  <li>be aware of potential <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/777373/Partnership_pack_Feb_2019.pdf">EU trade tariff changes</a>
</li>
  <li>check to see if you need a licence to export outside the UK</li>
  <li>find out the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports">commodity code for your goods</a>
</li>
  <li>choose the correct <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-customs-procedure-codes/customs-procedure-codes-box-37">customs procedure code</a> (CPC) for your goods</li>
  <li>get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-and-importing-fish-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">catch certificate</a> to show your fish, shellfish, crustaceans or fishery products were caught legally</li>
  <li>check the wider <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/partnership-pack-preparing-for-a-no-deal-eu-exit"><abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> guidance for exporters</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trade-agreements">Trade agreements</h2>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be no implementation period. In this scenario, the government will seek to bring into force UK-third country agreements from exit day, or as soon as possible afterwards.</p>

<p>These new agreements will replicate existing EU agreements as far as possible. Where replacement trade agreements are not agreed, trade would take place on <a rel="external" href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm">World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms</a> with that country. Details of each agreement will be shared with parliament and the public when they have been agreed.</p>
