</ul>

<h3 id="animals-products-of-animal-origin-or-germplasm">Animals, products of animal origin or germplasm</h3>

<p>To transport these products from the UK to the EU from 1 January 2021, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-export-health-certificate" class="govuk-link">export health certificate</a>, which you need to apply for in advance</li>
  <li>to get your goods checked at a <a href="#border-and-customs-offices" class="govuk-link">border control post (<abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr>)</a> that can accept your type of goods, in the first EU country you enter</li>
  <li>to make sure your EU-based import agent has notified the <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> that your consignment is arriving - check with the <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> for how much notice needs to be given</li>
  <li>to comply with wider <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trading-and-moving-goods-from-the-uk-to-the-eu-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> guidance on customs requirements</a> for exporting to the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re exporting live animals, meat or dairy, you can view flowcharts with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flowcharts-for-import-and-export-processes-after-brexit" class="govuk-link">steps you need to take</a>.</p>

<p>You should read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-composite-food-products-to-the-eu-in-a-no-deal-brexit" class="govuk-link">additional rules</a> if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>export composite food products to the EU</li>
  <li>want to check if your product counts as a composite food product</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="animal-by-products">Animal by-products</h3>

<p>To export animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-product">ABP</abbr>), you’ll need to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates" class="govuk-link">export health certificate (<abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr>) finder</a> to get either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-export-health-certificate" class="govuk-link">export health certificate (<abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>a model declaration form</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot find either of these for your product type, you’ll need to contact the competent authority in the EU country where your consignment is going - this means the equivalent of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) in that country. They will send you the paperwork you’ll need to fill in.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to comply with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trading-and-moving-goods-from-the-uk-to-the-eu-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> guidance on customs requirements</a> for exporting to the EU.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> need to go through a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr>. You can confirm this by checking the <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32007D0275" class="govuk-link">EU list of products</a> which must be inspected by a vet at a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr>.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="animal by-product">ABP</abbr> needs to go through a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> you must make sure that your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods are checked at a <a href="#border-and-customs-offices" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> that can accept your type of goods</a>, in the first EU country you enter</li>
  <li>EU-based import agent has notified the <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> that your consignment is arriving - check with the <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> for how much notice needs to be given</li>
</ul>

<p>If your <abbr title="animal by-product">ABP</abbr> does not need to go through a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr>, you must make sure that your EU-based import agent notifies the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>competent authority of the EU state that your consignment is going to</li>
  <li>EU port or airport, within the time limits set out by the competent authority</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exports-to-non-eu-countries-third-countries-from-the-uk">Exports to non-EU countries (third countries) from the UK</h2>

<p>There’s unlikely to be any change to the current export rules and processes for countries outside the EU. Make sure you check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-live-animals-special-rules" class="govuk-link">existing guidance on exporting live animals</a>.</p>

<h2 id="border-and-customs-offices">Border and customs offices</h2>
<p>You must get your animals and animal products checked at an EU <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr>, from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>These checks are made to protect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>animal health and welfare</li>
  <li>public health</li>
</ul>

<p>Your goods may be refused entry, seized, destroyed or returned to the UK if they arrive at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an EU port without a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> that can’t check your type of product</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="find-the-correct-bcp-for-your-goods">Find the correct <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> for your goods</h3>

<p>You must find a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> that can accept your type of goods - as not all <abbr title="Border control posts">BCPs</abbr> accept all goods. Consider how to redirect your trade route if needed.</p>

<p>There are more than 400 <abbr title="Border control posts">BCPs</abbr> in the EU and they’re usually at EU ports and airports.</p>

<p>Check the <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1563184991622&uri=CELEX:02009D0821-20190107" class="govuk-link">main list of <abbr title="Border control posts">BCPs</abbr></a> on the EU site.</p>

<h3 id="give-advance-notice-to-a-bcp">Give advance notice to a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>All  EU <abbr title="Border control posts">BCPs</abbr> require advance notice of goods arriving. Check with the <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> you’re planning to use for how much notice is needed.</p>

<p>Contact your import agent in the EU to make sure they notify the <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> through TRACES of the arrival of the consignment. They must do this within the time limits set out by the <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-if-your-goods-fail-inspection-at-a-bcp">What happens if your goods fail inspection at a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If your goods fail inspection because of risks to animal or public health, they will be destroyed immediately.
If the goods fail for other reasons, the <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify your importer or agent</li>
  <li>ask them to decide whether your goods should be destroyed or returned to the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> will not usually contact the exporter directly.</p>

<h2 id="rejected-goods-from-1-january-to-30-june-2021">Rejected goods from 1 January to 30 June 2021</h2>

<p>From 1 January to 30 June 2021, these consignments rejected at EU <abbr title="Border control posts">BCPs</abbr> may, subject to a risk assessment, re-enter Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) through any point of entry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>live animals including equines</li>
  <li>germinal products</li>
  <li>products of animal origin (<abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>animal by products</li>
</ul>

<p>GB importers must submit an import notification on IPAFFS.</p>

<p>Rejected goods are consignments rejected by the competent authority in an EU country. Consignments rejected for commercial reasons cannot be returned as rejected goods.</p>

<p>There are certain documentary requirements to return rejected goods to Great Britain from the EU.  The Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) will notify you if the returned consignment needs to enter through a <abbr title="Border control post">BCP</abbr> or can enter through any point of entry.</p>

<h2 id="eu-listing-of-the-uk-and-its-establishments">EU listing of the UK and its establishments</h2>

<p>The European Commission will vote on whether to list the UK as a ‘third country’ (non-EU-country) and allow exports of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>live animals</li>
  <li>germplasm</li>
  <li><abbr title="Products of animal origin">POAO</abbr></li>
  <li><abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr></li>
