<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Greece.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-greece" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This information is about living in Greece. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Greece.</a></p>

<p>State healthcare in Greece is not completely free. You may still have to pay to use some parts of the healthcare system.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Greek healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying national insurance contributions if you’re registered to work in Greece</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> in Greece</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Greece</h2>
<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-greece">register as a resident</a> if you want to stay in Greece for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>If you’re employed or self-employed in Greece, you’ll have to register with the Greek authorities and get a social insurance number.</p>

<p>Once you’re registered to work in Greece and make social insurance contributions, you’ll be entitled to state-run healthcare on the same basis as a Greek citizen.</p>

<p>Public healthcare in Greece is run by the Greek National Organisation for Healthcare Services Provision (EOPYY). The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.eopyy.gov.gr/">EOPYY website</a> (in Greek only) has information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to access healthcare</li>
  <li>EOPYY’s local offices that cover all Greek regions</li>
  <li>EOPYY-contracted doctors</li>
</ul>

<p>For non-emergency hospital appointments, you need a referral from an EOPYY doctor, health centre or local health unit (TOMY).</p>

<p>Once you’re a resident, you may be entitled to a Greek <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension</p>

<p>If you are not working and do not have a registered S1 form, you’ll have to take out private health insurance.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>Social insurance is called AMKA in Greek. You can get an AMKA number through your local citizens service centre or <a rel="external" href="http://www.kep.gov.gr/portal/page/portal/kep" class="govuk-link">KEP office</a> (website in Greek).</p>

<p>Once you’ve got your AMKA, you must register online with <a href="https://www.eopyy.gov.gr/eservices/insured" class="govuk-link" rel="external">EOPYY</a> (website in Greek). This will give you access to state healthcare services on the same basis as a Greek citizen.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>If you’re registered with EOPYY, you can see an EOPYY doctor for free or at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>Treatment in a state hospital is free if you’ve been referred by an EOPYY doctor or health centre.</p>

<p>You’ll pay around 25% of the cost of prescriptions, depending on the medicine. You may be able to get free or reduced cost medication, for example if you have a chronic illness.</p>

<p>If you go to a private clinic contracted with EOPYY, only part of the cost is covered by the state. You’ll need to make a co-payment towards the cost of your treatment.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Greece temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Greece using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Greece</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-greece" class="govuk-link">Greek resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Greece before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Greek system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to state healthcare in Greece on the same basis as an insured Greek citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Greece than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services  
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Greece</h3>

<p>You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-greece" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> then get a Greek social insurance (AMKA) number through your local citizens service centre or <a href="http://www.kep.gov.gr/portal/page/portal/kep" class="govuk-link" rel="external">KEP office</a> (website in Greek).</p>

<p>Once you’ve got your AMKA, you can register your S1 form with the Greek National Organisation for Healthcare Services Provision (<a href="https://www.eopyy.gov.gr/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">EOPYY</a>, website in Greek).</p>

<p>This will mean you’re entitled to access state healthcare on the same basis as a Greek citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Greece</h2>
<p>You can use an <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
