<h2>If your employer has less or no work for you because of coronavirus</h2>

<p>If your employer has less or no work for you because of coronavirus, they could get a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-could-be-covered-by-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme">Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</a> grant to help them to carry on paying you. This is known as being put ‘on furlough’ or ‘on flexible furlough’, and means that you’ll get at least 80% of your normal pay.</p>
