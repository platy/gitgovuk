<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guide outlines how organisations can become a recognised Producer Organisation (<abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>) under the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Aid Scheme.</p>

<p>It also explains how recognised <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> apply for operational programmes, and how you’ll be paid for these programmes.</p>

<p>The principal <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> / Community Regulations and domestic legislation governing the scheme are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02013R1308-20201229&amp;qid=1627913497620" rel="external">Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 1308/2013</a> laying down and establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation).</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02017R0891-20210428&amp;qid=1627913423494" rel="external">Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 2017/891</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02017R0892-20190101&amp;qid=1627913553906" rel="external">2017/892</a> laying down detailed rules for the application of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02013R1308-20201229&amp;qid=1627913653476" rel="external">Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 1308/2013</a> in respect of the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors.</li>

The Conditions of Operational Programmes section of this guidance provides details about the requirements of this regulation.</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-common-agricultural-policy-goods">The Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) (Protection of Community Arrangements) Regulations 2014 (SI 2014 No 3263)</a> providing details on the protection of Community arrangements under <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The arrangements set out in this guide apply to all recognised <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> and approved operational programmes.</p>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list of the entire scheme rules and criteria, as it is impossible to cover all areas of the scheme in depth. The full rules and criteria are set out in the above regulations.</p>

<p>The rules and obligations described in this guide arise from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulations that are binding in the United Kingdom. The Regulations are subject to alterations. Whilst every effort is made to ensure that the information given is complete and accurate, this cannot be guaranteed. Delays can occur both in publication and in the issue of amendments to guides. Where doubt arises on legal interpretation, advice should be sought from lawyers as ultimately only the European Court could resolve it. On any other matter the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) should be consulted.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to make sure that all documents are signed, submitted and received by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> by the required deadlines, which are set in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations. You can find the key dates and deadlines in the Operational programmes and the Operational Fund section.</p>

<p>We can only ensure compliance with the regulations if we have evidence that we’ve received your documents.</p>

<p>If you need a copy of any of the forms referred to in this manual, contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> using the contact details in Annex 3.</p>

<h3>How <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will use and share your information</h3>
<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is the data controller for personal data you give to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>. For information on how we handle personal data search for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency/about/personal-information-charter">‘Rural Payments Agency Personal Information Charter’</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Only recognised <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> or recognised Associations of Producer Organisations (<abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APOs</abbr>) can be paid under the scheme.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> is an organisation of fruit and/or vegetable growers recognised under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02013R1308-20201229&amp;qid=1627913497620" rel="external">Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 1308/2013</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02017R0891-20210428&amp;qid=1627913423494" rel="external">Commission Delegated Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No. 2017/891</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02017R0892-20190101&amp;qid=1627913553906" rel="external">Commission Implementing Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No. 2017/892</a>.</p>

  <li>locust (or carob) beans</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other criteria for recognition</h2>
<p>In addition to the basic criteria, your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> must also control the following activities.</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>Your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> must have full control of its members’ produce at all times, promote collective marketing, enable its members to target a variety of customers, and encourage an overall concentration of supply within the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>. It should always aim to be visible to suppliers.</p>

<h3>Provision of facilities</h3>
<p>Provision covers four key areas – collecting, storing, packaging and marketing. All four areas must be controlled for, or on behalf of, members. 
The only allowed exceptions would be where a particular element is deemed not necessary to that sector’s normal operations, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provision of storage facilities in the pea vining sector</li>
  <li>provision of packaging/packing facilities in the pea vining sector</li>
</ul>

<p>You must either provide actual facilities/services or arrange for them to be provided to all the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s members, including future members.</p>

<h3>Invoicing</h3>
<p><abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> must have a centralised bookkeeping system and a centralised system of invoicing.</p>

<h3>Size of individual members</h3>
<p>We will check to make sure that no single member is in a position where they can exercise undue control over the management and operation of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Democratic accountability and voting rights</h3>
<p><abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> should have a policy of ‘one member, one vote’ for all decisions affecting the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> to make sure there is no undue dominance.</p>

<p>Exceptionally, where a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has more than ten members, voting rights for individual members may be set up to a maximum of 10% with the remaining votes shared between other members. For example, this may happen where individual voting rights are weighted. If you intend to do this, you must ask the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> for approval.</p>

<p>Controls need to be in place to make sure that there is no abuse of power. Members must always be able to exercise control within their organisation. This also includes the election of board members/directors, and must be recorded in the members’ Agreements and Producer Articles of Association.</p>

<h3>Shareholdings</h3>
<p>Shareholding in a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> should be limited to 20% with an overall shareholding across the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> of no more than 49%. This means that no individual should have a shareholding of more than 20% in the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> itself.</p>

<p>If the same member also has shares in other <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members, this could have the effect of increasing their overall control in the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, with the potential for abuse of power. In these cases, both <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> and member shares should be added to make sure that no individual member has an interest in the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> of more than 49%. The <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> must make sure that the shareholding arrangements between members, the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> and other <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members do not result in any abuse of power.</p>

<h3>Control</h3>
<p><abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> must be controlled by the producer members. Non-grower members may have voting rights within a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, but no more than one vote each. If the total number of non-growers represents 20% or more of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> membership, then the voting power of non-growers must be further limited.</p>

<h3>Concentration of Supply</h3>
<p><abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> must carry out ‘placing on the market’. If you outsource this function, you remain responsible for it and must manage the contract between the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> and the service provider.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decisions on the product to be sold</li>
  <li>the choice of distribution channel</li>
  <li>negotiating the sale and price, unless the sale is carried out by auction</li>
</ul>

<p>You must keep records (including accounting documents) for 5 years. These will be checked during inspections. Records must demonstrate how the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has concentrated supply and placed members’ products on the market.</p>

<h3>Outsourcing</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances, recognised <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> may outsource their activities. You must get <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s permission to do this by providing sufficient evidence that outsourcing the activity is an appropriate way to achieve the objectives of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must have written contracts in place for all outsourced arrangements for main activities (for example, collecting, sorting, storing, and packaging and marketing members’ produce). This includes arrangements for activities carried out by individual members for the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, including activities under shared facilities agreements. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> must also have a copy of this.</p>

<p>All outsourcing contracts must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provisions which allow you to issue binding instructions on the activity to be carried out by the service provider</li>
  <li>detailed terms and conditions, including reporting obligations and deadlines so that you can assess the performance of the service provider</li>
  <li>a clause which allows you to end the contract if the service provider does not meet the terms and conditions of the contract</li>
</ul>

<p>You are responsible for managing the contract and making sure that the outsourced activities are carried out. This includes evaluating the performance of the service providers and taking action to address any failings in the level of service provided.</p>

<p>We will check for evidence of regular contact with the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s marketing agents, ongoing evaluation and review of the service providers to show how the contract has been managed on an ongoing basis. You must keep records (including accounting documents) for 5 years and provide these as part of our checks.</p>

<p>If the activity is carried out by a subsidiary of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, or an entity within a chain of subsidiaries, and the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> owns at least 90% of the shares or capital in that subsidiary, this is not considered outsourcing and a written commercial agreement is not required.</p>

<h3>Members from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States (Transnational <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr>)</h3>
<p><abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> can have members based in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States. However, if most of your holdings or members are not in the UK you must locate the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s head office, seek recognition in and meet the requirements of the Member State where the organisation has the most significant number of holdings or members, and/or where it obtains the highest level of marketed production.</p>

<h3>Members in non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries</h3>
<p>A <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> can have members from countries outside of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> but turnover from such members will not count towards the minimum eligible turnover for recognition. Their membership cannot count towards fulfilling the minimum membership criteria. Similarly, these members cannot benefit from the operational programme.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members that belong to more than one <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>
</h3>
<p>Members with several different holdings can be a member of a separate <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> for each holding. Members who wish to do this must discuss membership issues with their <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>. You must let the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> know if your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s members belong to more than one <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Exceptions to the 100% marketing commitment</h3>
<p>Members of a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> must market the entirety of the products for which they are recognised through the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>. However, producer members may market production outside the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, provided the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> gives permission and the members follow its conditions.</p>

<p>This must not exceed a total combined limit of 25% of their total production, calculated by volume, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sales of eligible crops directly onto consumers for their personal needs</li>
  <li>market quantities of products that are marginal in relation to the volumes marketable by their <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>market through another <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> designated by their own organisation products which, because of their characteristics, are not normally covered by the commercial activities of their own organisation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buying in produce</h3>
<p>You may buy in no more than 50% of your produce from other sources. However, produce bought in from another recognised <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> (including those located in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States) does not count towards this limit. Any produce bought in won’t be counted towards a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s marketed production, although it can be counted towards the marketed production of the exporting <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, if applicable.</p>

<h2>How to apply for recognition</h2>
<p>To apply for recognition for your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, fill in application form FV1.</p>

<p>You will also need to provide evidence which shows:</p>

</ul>

<p>You must provide evidence of articles of association which require member producers to apply the rules adopted by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>. Members must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>belong to only one <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> per holding per product category</li>
  <li>market their entire production through the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>provide any statistical information requested by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>pay the financial contribution to establish an operational fund</li>
</ul>

<p>The articles of association or membership agreement must have a process for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining, adopting and amending the rules of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>
</li>

  <li>action to be taken in the event of circumstances beyond the control of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> (force majeure);</li>
  <li>recoveries of investments, if a member leaves the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> group - <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will recover aid paid on the item, taking into account the write-down period where applicable</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also provide sufficient evidence that the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> can carry out its activities properly and effectively, allowing its members to get technical assistance to use environmentally sound cultivation practices.</p>

<h3>Timetable</h3>
<p>Applications for recognition can be submitted throughout the year.</p>

<p>We will let you know if your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has been approved no later than four months from the date when all relevant information was received.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> mergers</h2>
<p>If you’re considering merging your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, you should discuss with <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> and the relevant Devolved Administration.</p>

<h3>Points to consider</h3>
<p>You should consider the following points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the merged <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> is still viable - the essence of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> should not be affected by any restructuring</li>
  <li>the effective date of the new <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>when membership agreements with the old <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> will end and when the new agreements will begin</li>
  <li>who owns <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> assets after the merger (any capital items which have been paid for must be transferred to the merged group).</li>
</ul>

<p>We may recover aid on any capital funded items which are removed by the merged <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before a merger can take place, members will need to be consulted and agree to the merger. This can be done at an <abbr title="Annual General Meeting">AGM</abbr>, <abbr title="Extraordinary General Meeting">EGM</abbr> or via correspondence.</p>

<p>If members agree to the merger, you will need to agree:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the legal status of the newly merged <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>new articles of association, rules and members’ agreements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applying for recognition</h3>
<p>You will need to re-apply for recognition for the newly merged group.</p>

<p>You will need to prove that the newly merged <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> will be viable and supply the following supporting documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of members’ approval of the merge - this can be a copy of the minutes of an <abbr title="Annual General Meeting">AGM</abbr> or <abbr title="Extraordinary General Meeting">EGM</abbr>, or if members have been consulted in writing, copies of their replies</li>
  <li>a list of assets of the individual <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Application deadline for merged <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr>
</h3>
<p>You can apply at any time during the calendar year. However, if your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has an existing operational programme, you’ll need to apply by 15 August if you want to be recognised and start a merged operational programme by 1 January of the following year.</p>

<p>You should request the merger of the operational programmes through an in-year amendment, in accordance with Article 15 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R0891&amp;qid=1627913423494" rel="external">Commission Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 2017/891</a>.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> are merged, you may be able to continue with the individual operational programmes until they are completed. You should write to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>/Devolved Administration with your proposals, which will be handled on a case by case basis.</p>

<h3>Costs associated with mergers</h3>
<p>Legal and administrative costs incurred through mergers or acquisitions of <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> through the operational programme will be eligible for aid. They will be paid as part of the costs incurred under the programme, up to the limit of 4.1% of the marketed production.</p>

<p>Feasibility studies and proposals for mergers by a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> will also be eligible for funding. You will need to provide full documentation that clearly relates to the proposed merger. Please contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> for further information.</p>

<h2>Association of Producer Organisations (<abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>)</h2>
<p>An <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> is an umbrella body acting for two or more recognised <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr>. It must be a separate legal entity or a clearly defined part of a legal entity.</p>

<p>It can establish, submit and implement an entire or partial operational programme on behalf of its member <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr>. It’s also responsible for making claims and receiving aid payment on behalf of its member <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the member <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> wish to submit their own individual operational programmes, the <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> will be responsible for the co-ordination and running of measures or investments which are common to two or more <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr>. In this case the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> must maintain their own operational funds. If the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> or relevant Devolved Administration agree, an <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> which chooses this option may also submit its own operational programme on application form FV3.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> programme may include measures identified, but not implemented, by its member <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> within their operational programmes.</p>

<p>It can carry out any of the activities of a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<p>The 50% contribution to funding the measures to be carried out by the <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> should be fully financed by member <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr>, paid out of their operational funds. However, contributions may also be made by non-<abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members, proportional to those of <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members.</p>

<p>In addition, the measures and amount of financial participation should be listed in the operational programme of each participating <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Specific recognition criteria for <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APOs</abbr>

<h3>Democratic accountability</h3>
<p><abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APOs</abbr> should have a policy of ‘one <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, one vote’ for all decisions affecting the <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> to make sure there is no undue dominance, including electing board members and directors. <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> must have control over their <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must record arrangements in the members’ Agreements and Articles of Association.</p>

<h3>Non-<abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members</h3>
<p>An <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> can have members that are not recognised <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr>, but they must not directly receive <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> funding.</p>

<h3>Applications for recognition</h3>
<p>If you want to apply for recognition for an <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>, you should complete application form FV2.</p>

<p>You need to provide the following information with the application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof that you’ve opened a separate bank account if you’re implementing an operational programme on behalf of the <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> or its members.

  <li>require member <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> to provide the <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> with information on, and justify, the estimated income into the operating fund for the next year.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Application for operational programmes</h3>
<p><abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APOs</abbr> may claim administration costs of the standard flat rate multiplied by the number of <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members, up to a maximum of €1,250,000.</p>

<h2>Value of Marketed Production (<abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>)</h2>
<p>Value of Marketed Production (<abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>) is the figure that is used to calculate the ceiling on funding payable to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>. The value of marketed production is the value of produce at the point that it leaves the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> of a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> is calculated each year during the reference period of the producers. They must be members of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> on 1 January of the year that the funding is claimed for.</p>

<p><abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> is all the recognised produce that has been marketed and that is sold (not what is available to be sold). Details of what can and can’t be included are given below.</p>

<h3>Activities which are included in <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>

  <li>insurance monies received from harvest insurance where production is reduced due to a climatic event or animal or plant disease or pest infestations (read ‘Natural Disaster provision’ below) should be included in the <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> calculation in the 12 month reference period in which it was paid</li>
  <li>fruit and vegetables grown by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>/<abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> intended for processing and subsequently transformed into one of the processed products listed in part X of Annex 1 to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02013R1308-20201229&amp;qid=1627913497620" rel="external">Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 1308/2013</a> (as amended) - this can be carried out by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> or their members, or a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>/<abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> subsidiary or through outsourcing, and will be subject to a flat rate percentage when calculating the <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> as a whole</li>
  <li>internal transport costs where the distance between the centralised collection or packing points of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>/<abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> and the point of distribution is under 300km</li>

  <li>supplier rebates or supermarket over-riders - typically linked to volume of sales and supermarket promotions.</li>
  <li>the full value of any processed fruit and vegetable products</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reference period used to calculate <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>
</h3>
<p>The reference period used to calculate <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> is a 12 month period between 1 January and 31 December, three years before the year that the aid is requested, but no later than the last audited accounting period. This must be the annual accounting period of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Lack of historical data on the <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>
</h3>
<p>If you don’t have historical data on <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> for your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> because it has only recently been recognised, we will use the value you provided when applying for recognition.</p>

<h3>Natural disaster provision</h3>
<p>If your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> does not have harvest insurance, we will estimate <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> at 85% of the previous reference period’s marketed production of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> as a whole.  If you think you may need this provision, contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> with details.</p>

<h3>Buying and marketing produce</h3>
<p>Any produce which a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> buys in, regardless of source (for example, a grower who is not a member of a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or from a recognised <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>) cannot be counted towards <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The produce bought from a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> should be counted towards the <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> who sold the produce.</p>

<p>The value of produce that a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> is not recognised for, but has been marketed for another <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>, cannot be counted towards <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The value of produce that a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> is recognised for that has been marketed for another <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> can be counted towards <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Declaring the <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>
</h3>
<p>You must declare the <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> by 15 September every year. It should be included on either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the application for an operational programme (FV3)</li>
  <li>the annual operational fund statement (FVO/4) - please note that you need to submit this form even if you aren’t implementing an operational programme</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also explain how the <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> was calculated. Your explanation must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the total volume and value of all members’ produce that has been marketed, broken down by product type (for example, strawberries, apples or carrots); you don’t need to provide the class or grade of the produce. These should be the totals before you’ve removed anything included in the ‘Activities which are not included in <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>’ section</li>
  <li>any deductions, the reason for them, and the gross figure to be deducted from the total value; you must record each type of deduction separately</li>
</ul>

<p>If members’ marginal or direct sales are included in the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>’s total volume or value figure, you must record details of the deduction separately from other deductions. The volume for each member and whether the sales were marginal or direct, along with the percentage of sales, should be provided. In all instances the volume must be accurate. Only provide the value if it can be verified; do not provide an estimated value.</p>

<p>If marginal/direct sales of members are not included in the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>/<abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>’s total volume/value figure, you don’t need to provide details of the sales.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>’s recording system captures the required information, you may be able to supply the data as a supporting document to the FV3 or FVO/4. You should seek agreement from us if you’d like to do this.</p>

<h2>The Operational Fund</h2>
<p>Operational programmes must be financed by one operational fund. You must set up a bank account for contributions from your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s members.</p>

<p>Financial assistance will be paid directly into the operational fund.</p>

<p>The operational fund must be managed in a separate bank account to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s general account (such accounts should be named “[<abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> name] operational fund account”) and set up in the country where the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has its headquarters.</p>

<p>You will need to show that a fund has been set up before we can approve an operational programme. You should set this up alongside your application for recognition, for ease. The fund should be financed by financial contributions from members, or from the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> itself and any community financial assistance granted to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Inspectors or other registered officials may ask to see the account. You should retain all documentation to demonstrate a clear audit trail.</p>

<h3>Purpose of fund</h3>
<p>The fund can only be used for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>financing an approved operational programme (submitted to and approved by the Agency)</li>
  <li>administering the operational programme</li>
</ul>

<p>The fund must not be used for any other purpose.</p>

<h3>Members’ Contributions</h3>
<p>Members must make contributions before aid is paid. Members’ contributions can be made by taking levy from <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members, one off payments from each member or by using profits made by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>. This list is not exhaustive, and you should decide how you’ll collect the contributions before the programme commences.</p>

<p>If contributions are collected via member payments, all members should contribute equally to the fund. Members’ contributions must not be proportional to the amount of aid they receive. Differential contributions are acceptable in relation to different produce.</p>

<p>You don’t necessarily have to collect contributions before the end of the calendar year, but we cannot make payment until we’ve verified that you’ve raised enough funds to finance 50% of the programme.</p>

<h3>Level of Assistance</h3>
<p>The Commission has set a fixed level of financial assistance that can be paid towards the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s operational fund expenditure. Assistance will be paid at either 50% of the eligible expenditure or 4.1% of marketed production, whichever is lower.</p>

<p>An additional 0.5% funding is available for crisis prevention and management measures for <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> whose funding is based on 4.1% of their marketed production.</p>

<h3>Payments from the operational fund</h3>
<p>Any costs associated with the operational programme must be taken directly from the operational fund account.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> cannot pay invoices from the general account, nor can members pay invoices themselves and then reclaim the costs from the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s operational fund. If individual members or marketing agents pay their expenses directly and then seek repayment from the operational fund, this expenditure will be deducted from the annual claim.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, you may process some common costs (such as salary payments, VAT, or invoices which include both programme and non-programme expenditure) from the general account in the first instance.</p>

<p>You will need to justify the need for all such payments, which must be promptly re-credited from the operational fund account, and a clear audit trail must be provided. You will need to get prior approval from us to do this and each request will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>Operational Programmes</h2>
<p>Operational programmes can run for a minimum of three years up to a maximum of five years.</p>

<p>Note: New programmes approved after 29 December 2020 will have a maximum duration of 3 years.  They must contain at least two of the obligatory objectives in the ‘Obligatory objectives’ section and meet certain requirements set by the European Commission.</p>

<p>The operational programme must have overall objectives that comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/901206/National_Strategy_May_2020_-_tr01.pdf" rel="external">National Strategy</a>. The objectives are broken down into measures, which are then broken down into actions. The actions must be quantifiable as they must be reported on for each year of the programme.  Annex 5 of this guidance details measures, broken down into actions and the relevant output, result and impact indicator. This information is based on the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s accountancy year and operational year, not the reference period being used in that particular reporting year.</p>

<p>You can make changes to your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s operational programmes during the year, but this should only be done in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>You will need to submit documentary evidence to support the operational programme, including job descriptions, qualifications required to carry out specific jobs, and timesheets of people employed for <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> activities.</p>

<h2>Drawing up a programme</h2>
<p>Each expenditure item must relate to a specified action. You should set quantifiable targets to show how effectively the implementation of the programme objectives will be measured. You may use consultants to help with this, but you are strongly advised to discuss any proposals with the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> or relevant Devolved Administration before formally submitting them.</p>

<p>In drawing up the programme, you will need to demonstrate the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the programme has the full support of all <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members</li>
  <li>the objectives for the programme are realistic (the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> should not over-stretch itself)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> will be able to complete the full course of the programme</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ineligible/Eligible operations</h3>
<p>Non-exhaustive lists of ineligible and eligible operations are set out in Annexes II and III of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02017R0891-20210428&amp;qid=1627913423494" rel="external">Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 2017/891</a>.</p>

<h3>How to apply</h3>
<p>To apply for an operational programme, you should complete application form FV3 and send it to us, together with the below listed supporting information, by 15 September.</p>

<p>If approved, the programme will start on 1 January of the following year. Within the total programme duration of three to five years, the implementation and administration of programmes is broken down into calendar year periods.

<h4>Quotes</h4>
<p>You must provide three ‘like for like’ quotes, with full details of the planned expenditure, from different suppliers for each action in the operational programme.</p>

<p>You should explain which quote you have chosen and why.  For instance, if there is a preferred supplier, you should explain this and supply evidence supporting the reason why. We cannot accept one quote for a preferred supplier.</p>

<p>If three quotes for an identical specification are not available, you should explain why and provide supporting evidence demonstrating why these could not be obtained. For example, details of other companies you have approached for a quote and any evidence from them stating the reason why they were unable to provide a quote.</p>

<p>Where items are bespoke, the explanation for this should be accompanied by supporting evidence, for example, an explanation from the manufacturer confirming that they are the only suppliers of the specialist equipment.</p>

<p>All quotes and supporting evidence will be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Quotes which are in a currency other than sterling must be accompanied with the exchange rate you have used to convert.</p>

<h4>Approval notification</h4>
<p>Once applications have been submitted, we will assess and consider whether the application is complete, in conjunction with the Devolved Administration where relevant. If further information is required, we will let you know.</p>

<p>When your operational programme has been approved, you may begin from the approved start date. Expenditure incurred before this date will not be eligible for assistance unless directly related to the submission of the operational programme or preparatory work, which must commence to allow a specific task to be undertaken early the following year; for example, if a crop needs to be planted in December prior to 1 January to be ready for harvest in a particular month of the following year.</p>

<p>Extending measures over the life of more than one programme may  be possible from the outset of one programme, to budget the cost of major items over the life of more than one programme. Please contact the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> and provide details of the item and justification for budgeting over the extended period. Requests will be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<h3>Organic and experimental production</h3>
<p>You can claim funding for organic or experimental crop production, which can be funded over the course of more than one operational programme.</p>

<p>If you want to include experimental or organic production in your proposed operational programme, you should supply a detailed description of the planned production, along with an estimate of costs. We will consider these requests on a case by case basis. Funding will be based upon the difference between organic and conventional costs.</p>

<p>Experimental production can include the trialling of new breeds of plants, but plant breeding itself is not eligible for funding under the scheme.</p>

<h2>Setting objectives and measures</h2>
<p>When drawing up the programme you should consider how the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> will meet objectives. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02013R1308-20201229&amp;qid=1627913497620" rel="external">Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 1308/2013</a> (as amended) requires that programmes contain obligatory objectives.</p>

<p>A programme must also contain two or more environmental actions, or at least 10% of the expenditure of an operational programme should cover environmental actions. Please also refer to the Maximum expenditure on measures and actions section.</p>

<h3>Obligatory objectives</h3>
<p>A programme must contain at least two objectives referred to in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02013R1308-20201229&amp;qid=1627913497620" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation 1308/2013</a> Article 152(1)(c) or 2 of the objectives in Article 33(1).</p>

<h4>List of objectives in Article 152(1)(c)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring that production is planned and adjusted to demand, particularly in terms of quality and quantity</li>
  <li>concentration of supply and the placing on the market of the products produced by its members including through direct marketing</li>
  <li>optimising production costs and returns on investments in response to environmental and animal welfare standards, and stabilising producer prices</li>
  <li>carrying out research and developing initiatives on sustainable production methods, innovative practices, economic competitiveness and market developments</li>
  <li>promoting and providing technical assistance for the use of environmentally sound cultivation practices and production techniques, and sound animal welfare practices and techniques</li>
  <li>promoting and providing technical assistance for the use of production standards, improving product quality and developing products with a protected designation of origin, with a protected geographical indication or covered by a national quality label</li>
  <li>the management and valorisation of by-products, of residual flows and of waste, in particular to protect the quality of water, soil and landscape, preserving or encouraging biodiversity or boosting circularity</li>
  <li>contributing to a sustainable use of natural resources and to climate change mitigation</li>
  <li>developing initiatives in the area of promotion and marketing</li>
  <li>managing mutual funds</li>
  <li>providing the necessary technical assistance for the use of the future markets and of insurance schemes</li>
</ul>

<h4>List of objectives in Article 33(1)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>planning of production including production and consumption forecasting and follow up</li>
  <li>improvement of product quality, whether in a fresh or processed form</li>
  <li>boosting products’ commercial value</li>
  <li>promotion of the products, whether in a fresh or processed form</li>
  <li>environmental measures particularly those relating to water, and methods of production respecting the environment, including organic farming</li>
  <li>crisis prevention and management</li>
</ul>

<p>You must be able to demonstrate to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, relevant Devolved Administration or inspection officers how the above objectives are being met.</p>

<h3>Group expenditure into measures</h3>
<p>When drawing up programmes, you must group the individual items of expenditure into measures. This will be important when claims are submitted at the end of each year and the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has to report on each objective.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>An action is the activity the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> will carry out to achieve the measure and objective. For an action to be eligible, more than 50% by value of the products concerned by the action must be those for which the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> is recognised. To be counted in the 50%, products must come from the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s members or members of another <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Maximum expenditure on measures and actions</h3>
<p>The National Strategy sets maximum percentage levels of the fund which can be spent on any individual measure and type of action. This means there is an appropriate balance between different measures in each programme. 
No more than 60% of the fund can be spent on a measure per year of the programme, and no more than 40% of the fund can be spent on an individual action per year.</p>

<p>However, there are exceptions to these limits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some individual measures have a specific limit - you can find these in Annex 4 of this guidance</li>
  <li>no more than 20% of the fund can be used for research and development measures</li>
  <li>the limit may be extended, subject to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> agreement for major capital investments, where there is clear evidence of collaborative or collective value to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> and its members (for example, pea viners, packhouses, storage facilities)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Crisis Management &amp; Management Issues</h2>
<p>Crisis prevention and management measures can be included in operational programmes applied for within the UK.</p>

<p>You cannot spend more than one-third of the operational programme on these measures. This includes capital and interest repayments. Where these measures are included, additional funding of up to 0.5% may be available to those <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> whose funding is close to 4.1% of their <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>. This additional funding can only be used for crisis prevention and management measures and does not apply if a programme is funded using 50% of the programme expenditure.</p>

<p>To finance crisis prevention and management measures, <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> may take out loans on commercial terms. The repayment of the capital and interest on those loans can form part of the operational programme and be carried over to a subsequent programme on duly justified economic grounds. <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> can also finance these measures directly, however, only one method of finance can be used.</p>

<h3>Promotion and communication</h3>
<p>Additional funding may be used in times of crisis, over and above any promotion or communication already within the operational programme. This measure cannot be used to promote products where a lack of planning on the part of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has resulted in large volumes of produce being available.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>
<p>Training to deal with a crisis measure, over and above any training already included within the programme, may be funded.</p>

<p>There is no definitive list of training courses that are eligible under this measure. You should provide the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> with details of training courses for consideration.</p>

<h3>Harvest Insurance</h3>
<p>Harvest insurance must be managed by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>. It does not have to cover all members and can be targeted at specific members of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>. The insurance policy must be with a commercially recognised insurance firm.</p>

<p>50% of the premium is eligible for aid if the policy covers the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> for losses as a result of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>natural disasters and climatic events</li>
  <li>animal or plant diseases or pest infestations</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot claim funding for this measure if the insurance payment compensates for more than 100% of the income loss suffered. This provision also takes into account any compensation that may be received from other support schemes related to the insurance risk.</p>

<h2>Mutual Funds</h2>
<p>You may set up a mutual fund to insure the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, which will pay members compensation as a result of adverse market conditions.</p>

<p>These could include, but are not restricted to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>economic losses caused by an outbreak of adverse climatic events</li>
  <li>an animal or plant disease or pest infestation</li>
  <li>an environmental incident</li>
  <li>a severe drop in their income</li>
</ul>

<p>A severe drop in income is where the drop in income is at least 20% of the average annual income of the individual grower in the preceding three-year period.</p>

<p>An adverse market condition is an objectively existing situation in the market for a given product that leads to a drop of income of producer members. The drop must be more than 20% of the average price of the affected product in the preceding three-year period.</p>

<p>Increased input costs, such as price increase of fertiliser that may cause an increase in the cost of an affected product, may result in a loss of income where this increase in cost of inputs cannot be passed on to customers.</p>

<p>You should replenish the mutual fund through the operational fund.</p>

<p>Replenishment of funds should not cover any payments which compensate producers for more than 100% of the income loss suffered, taking into account any compensation the producers obtain from other support schemes related to the loss.</p>

<p>If the mutual fund is also used for purposes other than paying compensation to producer members, the resources allocated should be clearly identified and held in a separate account. Only the financial contributions that have been paid to producer members as compensation for a drop in income will be eligible for aid.</p>

<h3>Costs eligible for funding</h3>
<p>The following costs associated with mutual funds are eligible for funding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>administrative costs linked to the setting up of the mutual fund, as detailed in Article 40 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02017R0891-20210428&amp;qid=1627913423494" rel="external">Commission Delegated Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) No 2017/891</a>
</li>
  <li>financial contributions to replenish mutual funds, to cover the expenses detailed below</li>
</ul>

<p>Administrative costs can include management costs, registration fees, personnel costs and overheads. You may receive support for the administrative costs only once and only within the first three years of the operation of the mutual fund. The total amount of support, including both the scheme financial assistance and the contribution from the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> must not exceed 5% in the first year; 4% in the second year or 2% in the third year of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s contribution to the mutual fund.</p>

<p>Financial contributions to replenish mutual funds may cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amounts paid by the mutual fund as financial compensation to producer members who experience a severe drop in their income as a result of adverse market conditions</li>
  <li>interest on commercial loans taken out by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> to pay the financial compensation to growers from the mutual fund, where the funds available in the mutual fund would be insufficient to meet the compensation requests - the duration of commercial loans will be limited to the duration of the operational programme</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contributions from non-producer members</h3>
<p>Individuals other than producer members (e.g. non-producer members of the producer organisations) may contribute to the mutual fund’s capital stock. However, they are not entitled to receive any compensation or repayment from the mutual fund.</p>

<h3>Applying for a mutual fund</h3>
<p>When applying for a mutual fund in the operational programme, you must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of why the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> is setting up the mutual fund, confirming this has been agreed by all members, in line with <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s statute</li>
  <li>a copy of the mutual fund’s agreement that is in place, signed by all members, setting out the rules on how the mutual fund will be used</li>
</ul>

<p>The mutual fund’s agreement must include details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the mutual fund is going to be funded</li>
  <li>how the fund will be replenished by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members following compensation payments</li>
  <li>the rules around giving compensation to members (i.e. when compensation will be given and how this will be assessed)</li>
  <li>the rules around non-usage of the mutual fund</li>
  <li>clear rules attributing responsibilities for any debts incurred</li>
  <li>if applicable, a copy of the detailed rules to apply to a specific crisis</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to set your own additional criteria, you should discuss this with your Customer Relationship Manager.</p>

<h3>Using the Mutual Fund</h3>
<p>Before compensation can be paid to producer members from the mutual fund, the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> must carry out a full assessment, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the severe drop of income was calculated and established</li>
  <li>which products have been affected by the adverse market conditions, causing the severe drop in income; and</li>
  <li>how it is ensured that the price ex-producer organisation is aligned with the market price</li>
</ul>

<h3>Record keeping</h3>
<p>You must keep records and documentation, showing the following, for inspection by us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that this measure is included in the operational programme or its amendment</li>
  <li>the assessment that led to compensation from the mutual fund (including the assessment outlined in the ‘Using the mutual fund’ section)</li>
  <li>members’ produce, final destination of the production and the time period covered by this measure</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s contribution to replenishing the mutual fund and regular contributions of its members to the mutual fund</li>
</ul>

<h3>Claiming for funding</h3>
<p>When claiming funding for administrative costs relating to the set-up of the mutual fund, you must provide evidence of the expenditure incurred.</p>

<p>When claiming funding to replenish the mutual fund, you must provide supporting documents showing the full assessment of the compensation amount that has been carried out.</p>

<p>We will check and inspect all claims in the usual manner.</p>

<h2>Conditions of Operational Programmes</h2>

<h3>Relationship with Rural Development Programmes (<abbr title="Rural Development Programmes">RDP</abbr>)</h3>
<p>Support for environmental actions, other than acquiring fixed assets, must be limited to the maximum amounts laid down in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02013R1305-20210625&amp;qid=1627915122194" rel="external">Regulation 1305/2013</a> for agri-environmental payments. This is currently set at €600 per hectare for annual crops and €900 per hectare for perennial crops.</p>

<p>We will ask for acreage for each crop during the application process and annually when the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> is recognised. We will advise if your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> exceeds the calculate maximum funding.</p>

<h3>Environmental Actions</h3>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of environmental actions can be found at Annex 5 of this guidance. Other actions can be considered.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> or relevant Devolved Administration will look at each programme and decide whether the actions identified can be classified as environmental or whether they are more suited to other types of measures. For example, building a cold store can’t be classed in its entirety as an environmental action; however, certain elements of the build may be included, such as installing refrigeration units that use environmentally friendly gases.</p>

<p>You must include at least two environmental actions in the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s operational programme, or environmental actions must account for at least 10% of the operational programme expenditure. If you choose the 10% option, penalties will be incurred at the end of the operational programme if this is not met. The total amount of scheme funding due for the last year of the operational programme will be reduced in proportion to the amount of expenditure not incurred on environmental actions.</p>

<p>In the case of environmental investments aimed at achieving a reduction in the current use of production inputs, emission of pollutants or waste from the production process, you must provide an attestation of the reduction to be made from an independent body. The attestation must provide for a reduction of at least 15%. However, a reduction of 7% may be permitted where the investment allows for at least one additional environmental benefit.</p>

<p>In the case of investments aimed to achieve a reduction in water use in drip irrigation or similar systems, you must provide an attestation of the reduction to be made from an independent body. The attestation must provide for a reduction of at least 5%. You should provide evidence of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s current water usage and expected water usage under the new drip irrigation or similar system, and the method that has been used in this calculation. You should also provide evidence of the area under irrigation.</p>

<p>Investments must not result in a net increase of the land under irrigation.</p>

<p>If you provide an attestation, you do not need to prove that the investment has resulted in the reduction expected. However, you will be expected to report any savings in your annual report and explain if the savings are not made.</p>

<h3>Capital items</h3>
<p>Capital items include equipment, machinery, buildings, land (for development only), facility construction/installation and refurbishment work. Capital items may be paid for in full at the time of purchase, so the total cost could be eligible for funding at that time.</p>

<p>Alternatively, payment of capital items may be spread over a period, for example, loans, hire purchase or leasing agreements. Funding can then be paid on the amount of repayment made within each programme year. Taxes, interest charges, insurance arrangement, and operating costs are not eligible.</p>

<p>If the payment of capital items is to be spread over more than one operational programme it must be on clear and justified economic grounds. Any capital items purchased before the start of a new operational programme are not eligible. All such arrangements must be submitted and approved as part of the operational programme.</p>

<p>We will continue to check capital items after completion of an operational programme. If land is sold or leased to another party and conditions are breached, funding will be recovered. Interest and penalties will also be applied where applicable.</p>

<p>You must complete a Capital Assets register when applying for an operational programme. The updated register must be submitted in September of each year of the programme. It should include the item, year purchased, depreciation value and its location to provide inspectors with the necessary information to complete their checks.</p>

<p>If a capital asset is moved from one location to another, you can include this information in the annual update.</p>

<h3>Payment for services</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, and not individual members, must make payments directly. <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members may not pay for a service and then reclaim this back from the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>. This includes services such as storage and packhouse costs.</p>

<h3>Second hand items</h3>
<p>Second hand equipment will only be eligible for funding if you submit supporting documentation that provides a clear audit trail.</p>

<p>All supporting documentation supplied must comply with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32006R1828R%2801%29&amp;qid=1627913597441" rel="external">Commission Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 1828/2006</a>.</p>

<p>In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no funding may have been received on the equipment which is either National or Community in the last seven years - you must provide written confirmation, invoices and a declaration from the seller to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the price of the equipment must not exceed its market value, and cost should be less than that of similar new equipment</li>
  <li>the equipment must be able to perform the technical requirements necessary for the operation and must comply with the applicable standards</li>
  <li>you must provide a quote for the second hand item, as well as a quote for the cost of a new item to demonstrate that the cost of the item is reasonable</li>
  <li>you must also provide the reasons why you have elected to purchase second hand and why you have elected to use the chosen supplier</li>
  <li>all quotes and supporting evidence will be considered on a case by case basis</li>
  <li>quotes which are in a currency other than sterling must be accompanied with the exchange rate you have used to convert</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t approve funding on second hand equipment without the relevant information.</p>

<h3>Re-usable crop covers</h3>
<p>Horticultural fleeces may extend the cropping season by encouraging both early and late crops, reduce pest grazing, and sometimes reduce wind damage.</p>

<p>As part of production planning, fleece purchase may be considered as the purchase of a capital asset of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> where they are clearly used for a number of crops and seasons. Floating films are not funded.</p>

<p>If fleece is purchased, you should forecast what the effect on the cropping for the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> will be in terms of its intended change in crop volume or value.  This should include what the change in the total area cropped under cover will be for each crop.</p>

<h3>Hiring equipment</h3>
<p>We encourage <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> to purchase their own equipment, but the hiring of equipment may be acceptable in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>If you are intending to hire equipment within the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, you must inform the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> or relevant Devolved Administration prior to any final agreements. You must provide a clear economic justification for the decision and evidence that the costs involved are at market rate or lower. The <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s action must be transparent, ensuring there is no double financing or member dominance. We will consider each request on a case by case basis.</p>

<h3>Usage of capital items</h3>
<p>Operational programmes are approved on the understanding that <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> will obtain long-term benefits from any capital items purchased. Assets must remain in the property and possession of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> until the end of the retention period of 5 years.</p>

<p>If an asset is sold before the end of the retention period and not replaced, you will need to repay any scheme funding received to finance the asset, in proportion to the number of full years that remain until the end of the retention period.</p>

<p>Capital items should be depreciated in accordance with normal company policy. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> assumes a write down period of 20% per annum or five years.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> may recover 50% of any profit made from the lease of such assets. The <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will not seek recovery if profits are used to finance the operational programme in addition to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> funding. However, <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> cannot use these profits as members’ contributions to the operational fund or repay the profits back to individual members. The amount of aid to be recovered will be calculated by the Agency and will include any interest accrued on such items.</p>

<p>You must ensure any equipment funded under the scheme is used by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> more than 50% by value of the products it is recognised for. To be counted towards the 50%, the products must come from the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, another <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or an <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr>.</p>

<p>A capital item should be at the disposal of all members of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, and you must inform the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> on a yearly basis of the location or any changes to the long term location of the item. If you receive any money for an item, such as hiring costs paid by a non-member, these must be paid into the operational fund account. This will continue to apply following the end of the write-down period on the item.</p>

<p>You must have a written agreement to recover investments or the value of investments if a member leaves the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a member leaves the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, they should return any capital investments to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>. However, if this is not possible, an agreement must be reached for the member to retain the item but reimburse the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> for its residual value. You must add this to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s operational fund.</p>

<h3>Land purchase</h3>
<p>Funding may be paid on an area of land required for a building or installation that is part of an operational programme. If, however, a larger plot of land is purchased, funding will only be paid in proportion to the amount required for the purposes of the programme. The cost of the land should not be more than 10% of the total eligible expenditure for the measure. In addition, land purchased must remain in the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s ownership for at least 10 years.</p>

<p>Conditions will apply to each case of land purchase and details will be finalised when an operational programme is approved.</p>

<h3>Purchase of real estate</h3>
<p>You may claim funding for the purchase of real estate (buildings already constructed and the land on which they are built).</p>

<p>You must ensure you can provide the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> on request with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a certificate obtained from an independent valuer or duly authorised official body confirming that the purchase price does not exceed the market value</li>
  <li>proof to show that the buildings either conform to national regulations or highlight the points which do not conform to regulations and will need to be rectified by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>evidence that the building should not have received any national or Community funding in the previous 10 years</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only use the real estate for the purpose specified by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, which must meet the objectives of the operation, and it should normally remain in the ownership of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> for at least 10 years. However, if real estate has been previously purchased using Union or national support within a 10-year period, it cannot be funded under the scheme.</p>

<h3>Staff costs</h3>
<p>The eligible costs for staff approved under the programme are limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gross salary costs (including <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>)</li>
  <li>National Insurance contributions (both employers’ and employees’ contributions)</li>
  <li>company pension (non-contributory element)</li>
</ul>

<p>Holiday pay may be included, but payment in lieu of holiday not taken is not eligible under the scheme. Other staff costs and employment benefits may not be claimed. This restriction applies both to staff directly employed by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> and to specialist staff sub-contracted to provide services to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> on a continuous on-going basis.</p>

<p>Sick pay, maternity pay and bonuses are not eligible and the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> reserves the right to consider reviewing the eligibility of pensions.</p>

<p>The records required to support staff costs are job descriptions, timesheets (where staff are not employed 100% on the programme), and payroll records.</p>

<p>For specialist staff sub-contracted to work for the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, the contract or agreement between the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> and agent detailing the services to be provided must also be available, and the invoices for sub-contracting costs must identify the eligible and ineligible elements (such as commission and overheads).</p>

<p>All staff costs must be clearly explained with supporting documentation. The use of general headings such as ‘management time’ will not be acceptable. If accurate time sheets and any necessary supporting documentation are not maintained, then funding will not be paid on these costs.</p>

<h3>Specialist services</h3>
<p>If you purchase specialist services (a one-off action to perform a specific task), this is not considered to be a sub-contracted cost and is eligible for funding. You should provide supporting invoices which identify the services provided and a breakdown of the costs.</p>

<h3>Administration costs</h3>
<p>Funding will be payable for management, administration and implementation costs of the operational programme up to a limit of 1% of the operational fund, or €90,000, whichever is lower.</p>

<h3>Tax costs</h3>
<p>Apart from National Insurance Contributions, other taxes are not eligible for funding. These include VAT, Landfill tax and taxes incurred by grower members in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States. However, <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> is eligible as part of an employee’s salary, as detailed in the Staff costs section.</p>

<h3>Transportation costs</h3>
<p>Transport costs will be financed where they are seen to provide consideration and care for the environment, such as transport via shipping or railway to avoid road congestion and pollution problems. The costs paid under the scheme will be the extra costs incurred over the cost of transporting produce by road. All other transport costs (internal and external haulage) are ineligible.</p>

<p>However, the actual purchase/hire/lease of a refrigerated vehicle (atmosphere controlled) is eligible.</p>

<h2>Approved operational programmes</h2>
<p>You should inform the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> and relevant Devolved Administration of any difficulties you encounter during the programme implementation.</p>

<p>Your operational programme should be kept under constant review. You will be expected to review the content and estimated costs for future years of the programme.</p>

<h3>Double financing requirements</h3>
<p>The fruit and vegetables aid scheme rules do not allow funding for specific actions under more than one scheme (known as double or dual funding). You must make sure your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has measures in place to address this risk.</p>

<p>You must make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aid is not claimed for specific actions under more than one scheme</li>
  <li>investments on individual holdings do not receive dual funding</li>
</ul>

<p>This covers both capital investments (for example equipment) and agri-environmental measures under Rural Development schemes.</p>

<p>You should be aware of each member’s involvement with schemes other than the Fruit and Vegetables Aid Scheme, such as the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>) and Rural Development schemes. You should confirm the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> members don’t benefit from dual funding.</p>

<p>Evidence of this should be kept and will be checked during inspection. You should consider this when taking on new members and tell the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> when investments are placed on individual members’ holdings.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will continue to carry out checks on <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> and their members and if dual funding is found, payments of aid will be recovered.</p>

<h3>Changes to an approved programme in future years</h3>
<p>The content of an existing programme can be reviewed, and you must make an estimate regarding costs for future years of the programme.</p>

<p>You should complete form FV4 to request to change the programme to take account of any new conditions which could not have been foreseen when the programme started. All requests for changes for future years of the operational programme must be received by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> by 15 September, and must be accompanied by full supporting documentation justifying the changes requested.</p>

<p>The changes must not differ significantly from the original programme and objectives that were agreed initially. All changes must reflect the baseline indicators provided and be quantifiable using the reporting indicators.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will inform you if your changes have been accepted by 15 December.</p>

<h3>Making changes in-year</h3>
<p>You can apply to make changes to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s operational programmes in-year. These types of changes are subject to certain limitations and conditions.</p>

<p>As <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> must provide quantifiable targets on the success of measures and the overall objectives of the programme, only certain changes can be made. In-year amendments should be exceptional.</p>

<p>You must receive approval from the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> before making any changes. For more information, read the ‘When and how to request changes to programmes’ section.</p>

<h3>Changes to an approved programme made in year</h3>
<p>You may make the following in-year changes to the operational programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the implementation of only part of the operational programme</li>
  <li>changes to the contents of the operational programme, including the extension of its duration up to a total of five years</li>
  <li>changes to the amount of the operational fund up to a maximum 25% increase or decrease of the amount initially approved, provided the overall objectives of the programme are maintained</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making changes for prior approval</h3>
<p>You must apply to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> by submitting form FV7 giving details of any proposed in-year changes. You may only make changes once you have received approval – changes made prior to this will be void. The operational fund expenditure cannot be 25% above or below the approved cost for that year.</p>

<p>In addition to the FV7 form, you must complete and send the relevant Annex and the requisite 3 quotes, as detailed in the below sections.</p>

<p>You must answer all questions on the annexes fully and include as much detail as possible so we have a fully documented explanation of what the FV7 is for.</p>

<p>You should include the full set of documents in a single email and we will only accept one email per amendment.  Please label your email with <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> name, action number, form reference, for example: “<abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> name - Action 2.8 - FV7”.</p>

<h3>Completion of Annexes</h3>
<p>When purchasing assets, you should explain why the make/mode/brand/type was selected.<br>
If you are purchasing numbers of things, you should include quantity/volume/area covered, etc.</p>

<p>You should also include details of where within the National Strategy or Environmental Framework the action fits, for example: ‘Polytunnels – Planning of Production 3.2.1.1  Modern growing systems and associated equipment such as polytunnels tabletops, hydroponic systems’.</p>

<p>If the proposal is not in the list of actions, you must provide a full description of where you consider it fits and why.</p>

<h3>Soundness of price estimates</h3>
<p>You must provide three ‘like for like’ quotes from different suppliers for each action in the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s operational programme. You should submit these to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> at the same time as FV7 amendments, with full details of the planned expenditure in the annexes.</p>

<p>You should explain which quote you have chosen and why.  For example, if there is a preferred supplier, you must explain why and provide evidence and reasonable justification. You must provide quotes and evidence that a wider search has been carried out. We cannot accept one quote for a preferred supplier.</p>

<p>If three quotes for an identical specification are not available, you should explain why and provide supporting evidence demonstrating why you were unable to obtain these, such as details of other companies you have approached for a quote and any evidence from them explaining why they were unable to provide a quote.</p>

<p>If you are buying bespoke items, you must explain why with supporting evidence; for example, an explanation from the manufacturer confirming that they are the only suppliers of the specialist equipment.</p>

<p>We will consider all quotes and supporting evidence on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>If your quotes are in a currency other than sterling, you must show the exchange rate you have used to convert.</p>

<h3>Making changes without prior approval</h3>
<p>You may implement monetary changes only without prior approval from the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> or relevant Devolved Administration, provided the change is not more than 20% of the initially approved funding for the action.</p>

<p>The change must be purely financial, for example if the cost of a piece of equipment has risen substantially. If you want to change the specification of the action in question, then you must seek prior approval as normal.</p>

<p>The 20% tolerance level has been set for all <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> whereby deviations in the actual costs of individual operational programme action need not be informed to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> until the ‘Annual Claim’ stage. This is conditional on the content of the action remaining as originally approved and on an explanation of the change being submitted with the annual claim.</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>You can make a claim in three ways. You should apply for each type of claim by submitting form FV6.</p>

<p>An Arrears claim is a claim made against expenditure which the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has made against approved actions within the Operational Programme. You can submit requests for payment in arrears at any time, but no more than three times in any given year. You may only claim expenditure that has been paid and has cleared the Operational Fund Account.</p>

<p>An Advance payment is a claim made ahead of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> making potential purchases against approved actions within the Operational Programme.  You can only submit these requests quarterly and a security will be required.</p>

<p>An Annual payment is a claim for expenditure which the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has made for the whole year of the programme.  If you have already made arrears claims in year, these will be deducted from the final annual payment. You must submit an annual claim, but Arrears or Advance claims are optional.</p>

<p>You cannot submit a mixture of advance and partial arrears claims during the same year.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr></h3>
<p><abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> figures must be verified prior to any payments being released. This verification may take place in advance of the first claim being submitted or during the first payment inspection.</p>

<h3>Proof of expenditure</h3>
<p>When you submit a claim, we will arrange for an inspector to visit the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> to verify the expenditure claimed. Payment will be made as soon as possible after we receive the inspector’s report.</p>

<h3>Arrears payments</h3>
<p>All arrears payments will be limited to 80% of the total expenditure claimed.</p>

<p>We will check that the total payments in arrears claimed during the year do not exceed the relevant ceiling. If the total amount claimed exceeds this ceiling, your claim will be reduced to the amount available after the ceiling has been applied.</p>

<h3>Advance payments</h3>
<p>To qualify for an advance payment you must be able to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have collected the operational fund levies from your members</li>
  <li>the corresponding <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> contribution has been spent</li>
  <li>any previous advance payments have been spent</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to claim</h3>
<p>You may claim during the following quarters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 January – 31 March</li>
  <li>1 April – 30 June</li>
  <li>1 July – 30 September</li>
  <li>1 October – 31 December</li>
</ul>

<p>You must submit your claim during the first month of a quarterly claim. For example, for the quarter January to March, the FV6 must be submitted within the period 1 January - 31 January or the claim will be rejected. The claim must be based on estimated expenditure of what is likely to be incurred for each action (including quotes from anticipated suppliers, if not already provided) and must be signed by an authorised signatory.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Requests for advance payments must be accompanied by a security equal to 110% of the sum advanced. Securities may be lodged by block guarantee or single transaction guarantee. Full details are available on request from the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s Guarantee Section.</p>

<h3>Making a security payment</h3>

<h4>Single transaction guarantee (STG)</h4>
<p>You can use an STG for a single transaction. You need to complete guarantee form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948944/fdgs6t_-_IX6S_-_v3.0_Dec_2020.pdf" rel="external">IX6S (Sterling)</a> (PDF, 196KB, 3 pages) and return it to the address on the form.</p>

<h4>Block guarantee</h4>
<p>You can use a block guarantee for any number of transactions up to the value of the guarantee. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will repay your security when your obligations under each specific license have been met.</p>

<p>You must make sure that there is sufficient available security to cover each transaction. To help you do this, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send you a statement each week or every 4 weeks which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lists all outstanding transactions</li>
  <li>tells you how much of your guarantee is unused</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also ask <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> for a statement whenever you need one.
You should send new block guarantees to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> on guarantee form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948943/fdgs3t_-_IX5S_-_v3.0_Dec_2020.pdf" rel="external">IX5S (Sterling)</a> (PDF, 204KB, 3 pages).</p>

<h3>Proof of expenditure</h3>
<p>An advance payment cannot be authorised until expenditure from the previous advance payment has been fully used and verified by an <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> inspector.</p>

<h3>Release of securities during the year</h3>
<p>Applications for release of security may be submitted using form FV10. We will release up to 80% of the security covering an advance payment when the quarterly claim for payment has been finalised.</p>

<p>Applications for release of security lodged against a previous advance payment must have no bearing on the security required for the current claim. Before a release of security is actioned any expenditure from the previous advance payment has been fully used and verified by an <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> inspector.</p>

<p>The remainder of outstanding security will be released on verification of the annual claim.</p>

<h3>Annual payment</h3>
<p>Applications for an annual payment must be received by us no later than 15 February of the year following the programme year. Applications must be accompanied by an annual report and cannot be accepted where this is not supplied.</p>

<p>If your applications are received late, the total aid for that year will be reduced by 1% per day.</p>

<p>If you do not submit an annual claim, funding already paid against arrears claims during the year will be recovered.</p>

<h3>How to apply</h3>
<p>You must supply the following information when applying for an annual payment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> - this will already have been verified by an inspector earlier in the year</li>
  <li>financial contributions levied on its members and those of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> itself</li>
  <li>expenditure on the operational programme paid for from the operational fund</li>
  <li>expenditure on crisis prevention and management broken down by actions (the proportion of the operational fund spent on crisis prevention and management, broken down by actions)</li>
  <li>proposed carry-over items - these include any measures for which a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> is unable, due to exceptional circumstances, to implement by 31 December but will complete and pay for by 30 April</li>
  <li>an annual report (form FV5) – this will detail objectives broken down into measures financed from the operational fund (if <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> fail to provide their annual report, administrative penalties will apply)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the application is for the penultimate year of the programme, you must also submit an evaluation report to include the extent to which the objectives have been achieved. The report must also mention any factors which contributed to the success or failure of implementing the operational programme and how these were considered in the ongoing programme.</p>

<p>The report must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a written undertaking that the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or its members have not received any duplicate community funding in respect of measures/operations carried out under this scheme - this statement is included in form FV5</li>
  <li>confirmation that an equivalent contribution from the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> remains in the operational fund</li>
</ul>

<h3>Retention of other documents for verification and audit</h3>
<p><abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> and their members must keep all commercial documents for at least three years from the end of the year in which they were drawn up.</p>

<p>Commercial documents are defined as all receipts, books, registers, vouchers and supporting documents, accounts and correspondence used.</p>

<p>Records must be made available for inspection for verification and audit purposes.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>
<p>Payment is based on the lesser of 50% of operational fund expenditure or 4.1% of the verified <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>. This may be increased up to 4.6% where additional funding on crisis prevention and management measures has been approved.</p>

<p>Payment will be authorised up to a maximum of 25% over the initially approved aid amount, provided the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has submitted form FV7 for additional expenditure and received approval from the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The final payment will be offset against any payments made in respect to advance or arrears quarterly claims that have been made during the year.</p>

<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>Payment will be authorised as soon as the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> is satisfied the requirements of the scheme have been met and that the accuracy and completeness of documents have been verified by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s Inspectorate. If the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> requires additional documents, you will be informed.</p>

<p>The regulatory deadline for making payments is 15 October.</p>

<h2>Recoveries and sanctions</h2>

<h3>Sanctions</h3>

<p>If a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> breaches the recognition criteria, it will receive a warning letter explaining the breach and how serious it is. The letter will explain what the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> needs to do to correct the breach. The breach must be corrected within four months.</p>

<h3>Serious breaches</h3>
<p>Examples of serious breaches of recognition include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>failure to meet minimum number of members (set by Member State)</li>
  <li>failure to fulfil the structure and activities of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, e.g. failure to have knowledge of members’ production, collecting, sorting, storing and packaging the production of their members, commercial and budgetary management and centralised book keeping and system of invoicing</li>
  <li>breaches linked to the concentration of supply and placing on market of products members are recognised for</li>
  <li>sale of non-member produce (breach of 50% rule)</li>
  <li>failure to ensure democratic accountability</li>
</ul>

<p>If a serious breach is found, all payments of aid will be suspended from the date of the warning letter until corrective action is taken.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> fails to meet the recognition criteria within the four month period, the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> will be suspended. During suspension, the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> may continue its activity and aid will accrue but this will not be paid until the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> meets the recognition criteria. A 2% penalty will be applied to the yearly aid amount for each full or part month the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> is suspended (limited to the aid year in question).</p>

<p>if the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has not taken corrective action within 12 months of the date of the warning letter, its recognition will be withdrawn.</p>

<h3>Other breaches</h3>
<p>Examples of breaches which are not considered serious include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>failure to meet minimum <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> (set by Member State)</li>
  <li>failure to carry out activities properly over time and in terms of effectiveness, provision of human, material and technical support</li>
  <li>inconsistent <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> statutes</li>
</ul>

<p>If one of these breaches is found, payments of aid will be suspended after the four month deadline has passed if corrective action has not been taken. A 1% penalty will be applied to the yearly aid amount for each full or part month the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has not corrected the breach (limited to the aid year in question).</p>

<p>If corrective action is not taken by 15 October of the second year following the year of the operational programme, the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> will lose the whole yearly aid payment.</p>

<p>For each subsequent aid year, the 1% penalty will continue to apply to any aid accrued for that year (on a rolling basis) until the breach is corrected.</p>

<h2>Recoveries</h2>
<p>The amount of money recovered will vary according to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s degree of non-compliance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Examples of scenarios where the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> may recover aid paid, including sanctions and interest as described below, are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the value of marketed production verified is found to be less than the amount declared by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> and used to calculate aid</li>
  <li>the operating fund of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has not been maintained in accordance with the regulation or has been used for purposes other than the funding of the operational programme</li>
  <li>the operational programme has been implemented in a manner which differs from the programme originally approved by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If it is necessary to make an adjustment to the amount of aid claimed, the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> may need to recover aid paid, reduce the amount of aid the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> is entitled to, and, if appropriate, apply interest and sanctions.</p>

<p>If the difference between the amount claimed and the amount found to be eligible is less than 3%, the eligible amount will be paid and no sanction will apply. For example, claimed £100,000, eligible £98,000 (3% of £98,000 = £2,940). The amount over claimed is £2,000 therefore the amount payable is £98,000.</p>

<p>If the difference between the amount claimed and amount found to be eligible is more than 3% then the eligible claim will be reduced by the amount overclaimed. For example, claimed £100,000, eligible £90,000 (3% of £90,000 = £2,700). The amount to be paid will be £10,000 less than claimed plus a £10,000 penalty, therefore the amount payable is £80,000.</p>

<p>An overclaim could also result in an invoice being raised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in cases of obvious error, to reimburse the amounts unduly paid out, plus interest</li>
  <li>if a beneficiary is found to have committed fraud in respect of aid covered by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02013R1308-20201229&amp;qid=1627913497620" rel="external">Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 1308/2013</a> (without prejudice to any other sanctions and penalties applicable under national legislation) recognition will be withdrawn, the application or operations concerned will be excluded from the support under the operational programme, any aid already paid from that operation will be recovered, and the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> or <abbr title="Association of Producer Organisations">APO</abbr> will be excluded from support under the operational programme during the next year</li>
  <li>if a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> prevents an Inspector from making an on the spot check, the application for aid will be rejected</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interest and Penalties</h3>
<p>These will be applied to any support payment discovered to be unduly paid. The interest will be based on the period elapsing between payment and reimbursement and the European Central Bank rate in force on the date of undue payment, plus three percentage points.</p>

<h2>Inspections and Assessments</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will arrange an inspection visit to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on receipt of an application for recognition</li>
  <li>on receipt of a request for release of security or interim or annual claims for payment</li>
</ul>

<p>The inspection visit to the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> will carry out specific checks on one or more of the following aspects of the programme, to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the operational programme actions are being implemented in accordance with the approved operational programme</li>
  <li>no ineligible expenditure has been claimed</li>
  <li>the operating fund contributions are being collected as stated by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> and the operating fund is being administered correctly</li>
  <li>satisfactory records are being maintained</li>
  <li>no duplicate Community, national or regional funding is being received, directly or indirectly, for any actions qualifying for Community funding under these arrangements</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has collected enough contributions to cover the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>’s proportion of the previous years’ expenditure</li>
</ul>

<p>to verify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the actual expenditure figures for the operational programme. This is the amount actually paid by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> during the quarter and the amount has been incurred during the current programme year</li>
  <li>the declared marketed production and marketed quantity figure</li>
</ul>

<p>to check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the accuracy of the information supplied with the payment request</li>
  <li>the records maintained by the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> are accurate</li>
</ul>

<p>Checks carried out by the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Section will occur before payment is made.</p>

<h3>Right of entry</h3>
<p>You will usually receive notice of when an inspection is due to take place, but an unannounced visit may be carried out. You must grant access to authorised officers at all reasonable times, whether or not prior notification has been given. If a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>, the member or the relevant representative prevents an inspector from making a check, the application for aid will be rejected.</p>

<h3>Following receipt of the inspection report</h3>
<p>You will be notified of the outcome of the inspection visit.</p>

<p>If the report is satisfactory, security will be released, or payment made, as appropriate.</p>

<p>If the inspection visit is not satisfactory, we will write to you outlining the inspection findings.  This may result in non-payment of claimed expenditure and potential sanctions.  Further payments may not be made until the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> has taken corrective measures specified by the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Inspections on capital items</h3>
<p>If <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> have capital items with a write-down period which continues after the end of the operational programme, the item may still be inspected, even if the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> decides not to continue with the scheme. If any inaccuracies are discovered during an inspection or it is found that the item has been sold, recoveries against the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> will be considered.</p>

##Annex 4: National Strategy: Actions table</p>

<h3>Actions that may be included in operational programmes</h3>

<p>The following summary identifies specific actions and a non-exhaustive list of actions.
We will consider detailed proposals from <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> for other actions to further their programme objectives.</p>

<h4>Planning of production in relation to demand in terms of product quantity</h4>
<p>Planning, both long term and ongoing, must ensure that all production of all members is marketed and that the market outlets can be serviced with the quantities and qualities required. Progress will be measured by comparing the quantity and value of product that gets placed on the market at the end of the programme with the situation at the start of the programme.</p>

<h5>Acquisition of fixed assets</h5>

<h6>Action</h6>
<ul>
  <li>investments in computers, data loggers and specific computer software, centrally and/or on individual holdings; aimed at controlling or recording the crop production environment</li>
  <li>investments in new areas of trees, bushes and canes to meet increased product demand, including new varieties or new rootstocks</li>
  <li>machines for specialist production/harvesting/packaging etc. activities and increased labour efficiencies (for example – planting and harvesting/vining rigs, pea tanks, irrigation equipment, grading weighing and packaging equipment for especially where this will help reduce labour requirements)</li>
  <li>equipment for soil remediation (e.g. subsoilers)</li>
  <li>modern growing systems and associated equipment such as polytunnels, table tops, hydroponic systems</li>
  <li>crop covers and associated winding gear</li>

  <li>investments in hail and frost protection systems</li>
  <li>investments in new planting techniques e.g. rootstocks, bedmaking equipment</li>
  <li>investments in ancillary crop specific machinery to maintain the freshness and quality of the crop</li>
</ul>

<h6>Eligibility conditions including exclusions/restrictions</h6>

<h3>Ceiling on Aid</h3>
<p>An individual ceiling on aid is applied to each <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> with an operational programme. This is a fixed ceiling set at 4.1% of the value of the marketed production (<abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr>) based on the relevant reference period or 50% of eligible expenditure, whichever is lowest. An additional 0.5% of aid is available solely for crisis prevention and management measures. <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> who are at or near the maximum ceiling of 4.1% can claim this additional funding. <abbr title="Producer Organisation">POs</abbr> will not be able to claim more than 4.6% of their <abbr title="Value of Marketed Production">VMP</abbr> figure.</p>

<h3>Direct Sales</h3>
<p>These are sales by members of a <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> sold directly to consumers for their personal needs (for example, farm gate sales, farm shops sales, or pick your own). Such sales are subject to the agreement of the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> and must be in compliance with Regulatory and <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> rules.</p>

<h3>Evaluation Report</h3>
<p>In the last but one year of the operational programme, a report must be submitted. It takes the form of an assessment of the entire programme.
