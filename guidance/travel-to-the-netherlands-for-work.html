<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to the Netherlands to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings.</p>

<p>These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>The Dutch authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/work/working_in_the_Netherlands/Pages/Employee.aspx" rel="external">Dutch government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in the Netherlands. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with the Dutch <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in the Netherlands, so you know which ones to use when speaking to the Dutch authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You do not need a visa or permit for the following activities if their combined duration is no more than 13 weeks in a 52-week period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attending job interviews</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs</li>
  <li>board meetings</li>
  <li>business meetings with clients or customers (including entertainment such as eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>meeting contractors or sellers of products or services you’re reviewing or fact-finding</li>
  <li>negotiating, signing or executing deals or contracts</li>
  <li>team building activities to get to know the company’s culture</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference if you’re not being paid</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need a visa or permit for these activities if they’re for no more than 12 consecutive weeks in a 36-week period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving classroom-based training in the same company or company group, or in a clear training environment</li>
  <li>assembling or repairing hardware, machinery, or equipment on site, as long as the UK employer delivered the hardware to the customer</li>
  <li>installing, implementing or adjusting software, as long as the UK employer delivered the software to the customer</li>
  <li>providing end-user training for operating hardware or software, as long as the UK employer delivered the hardware or software</li>
  <li>receiving training or instructions on how to use goods manufactured in the Netherlands, or services to be performed in the Netherlands</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement</h3>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).</p>

<p>You do not need a visa or permit for the following activities if they’re for no more than 90 days in a 180-day period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sales and commercial transactions</li>
  <li>after-sales or after-lease services</li>
  <li>market research</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities must not involve the sale of goods or services to the general public. As a business visitor for a short stay you must not receive a financial reward in your own name from a source within the Netherlands.</p>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter explaining your trip, or a plan for any training you’ll be doing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check exemptions for the Netherlands</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>These do not require a visa or permit in the Netherlands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>musicians and artists who are working in the Netherlands for a maximum of 6 continuous weeks in a 13-week period</li>
  <li>those with an EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) from another country –your Dutch employer must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.werk.nl/werkgevers/images/Formullier_Notification_of_an_Intra_corporate_transfer_ICT.doc" rel="external">notify the Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen (UWV)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These exemptions are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>employment confirmation</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma or professional certificates</li>
  <li>CV</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">Dutch immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> before you travel.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with the Dutch <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>You may be able to apply for dependant permits if you have a family and want them to join you. It depends on the type of permit you have. Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/family/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">taking your family with you</a>.</p>

<h3>Work and residence permits</h3>

<p>If you’re working in the Netherlands for less than 90 days, your Dutch employer or the host company in the Netherlands will need to apply for a work permit for you. A residence permit is not required if your stay is for less than 90 days.</p>

<p>If you work in the Netherlands for more than 90 days, you will need both a residence and work permit or a combined residence and work permit (single permit). The combined residence and work permits can be valid for up to 5 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<p>You must apply for a permit if you’re in the Netherlands because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring to a Dutch branch of a UK-based company</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a Dutch company on a Dutch employment contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing services to a client in the Netherlands</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employment">carrying out self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#startup">a start-up entrepreneur</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting scientific research</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Transferring to a Dutch branch of a UK-based company</h2>

<p>You need one of these permits if your UK-based company moves you to a Dutch branch to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#ict">EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT)</a>, for managers, specialists or trainees</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#national-ict">national intra-corporate transfer (ICT)</a>, for trainees, company representatives or specialists</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#uk-ict">intra-corporate transfer (ICT) (UK only)</a>, based on the EU and UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement</li>
</ul>

<h3>EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT)</h3>

<p>You need an [intra-company transfer permit (ICT) if your UK-based company moves you to a branch in the Netherlands to work for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 3 years</li>
  <li>1 year if you’re a trainee</li>
</ul>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a manager, specialist or trainee</li>
  <li>earn a salary in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/pages/required-amounts-income-requirement.aspx#Application_for_residence_permit_highly_skilled_migrant_and_European_Blue_Card" rel="external">Dutch labour market</a>
</li>
  <li>have the appropriate educational qualifications for the role – trainees must have a Dutch master’s degree or an equivalent one from a university outside of the Netherlands</li>
  <li>have the required experience for the role</li>
  <li>have worked for the company abroad for at least 3 months (or 1 month for trainees)</li>
  <li>prove that you’re allowed to carry out your profession in the Netherlands if working in a regulated profession, for example if you’re a doctor or architect</li>
  <li>have employment terms and conditions at the level expected for your industry</li>
  <li>not have been previously transferred to the Netherlands on an EU ICT in the 6 months before you apply</li>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract</li>
</ul>

<p>The branch in the Netherlands must not have been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>created for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of employees into the EU</li>
  <li>fined for employing someone illegally or for not paying social security contributions 5 years before submitting the application</li>
</ul>

<p>It can take 2 to 12 weeks to get an EU ICT. You can’t extend it beyond the 3 years, or 1 year if you’re a trainee.</p>

<p>If you have a partner and any children under 18 they can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/family/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">join you</a> with this permit type.</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>You need to check with the Dutch authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Your employer submits a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/forms-and-brochures.aspx" rel="external">residence permit application</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="#ict-documents">necessary documents</a> to the immigration office (IND).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You attend an appointment at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">IND</a> in the Netherlands to collect your work authorisation passport sticker and submit biometric information once your application has been approved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You register yourself on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/personal-records-database-brp" rel="external">personal records database (BRP)</a> in the municipality where you’re living.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You collect your residence permit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You get the required health insurance.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Application documents</h4>

<p>Dutch authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed permit application form</li>
  <li>passport for you and any dependants, valid for at least 6 months</li>
  <li>degree or qualification certificate</li>
  <li>CV</li>
  <li>employment contract with your UK employer</li>

  <li>copy of training agreement for trainees</li>
  <li>
