    <p>Guidance is practical information that people need to complete a task or make a decision.</p>
<p>All guidance published on GOV.UK must have a clear user need (backed up with evidence) and be about something the government does (for example issuing passports or driving licences).</p>
<p>Before you create guidance content you must decide whether your users are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>members of the public (or small businesses) with no specialist skills or experience - ‘mainstream’ users</li>
  <li>specialists who are trained or experienced</li>
</ul>
<h3>Guidance for mainstream users</h3>
<p>Mainstream guidance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>is for the general public or small businesses</li>
  <li>is written for users who do not have (and are not expected to have) any previous experience or specialist knowledge of the subject</li>
  <li>guides users from when their need arises to when they complete a task or have the information they need to complete a task (this can include directing users to third-party organisations)</li>
  <li>is organised and written by task, rather than audience or the government department or agency</li>
  <li>explains the current situation - it only describes future changes if they are certain or very likely to happen and affect choices a user can make right now, for example if users should apply for something now because a scheme is closing or a service will be down for maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>Volume of users does not necessarily make something suitable or unsuitable for mainstream guidance.</p>
<p>Mainstream guidance must not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>duplicate content better served by other organisations (for example charities, the NHS, Citizens Advice)</li>
  <li>give advice or offer opinions</li>
</ul>
<p>Guidance for mainstream users is written and maintained by the content team at GDS.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/content_change_request/new" rel="external">Send a content request</a> for new content or to make changes to existing content.</p>
<h3>Guidance for specialist users</h3>
<p>Specialist guidance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>is aimed at specific audiences who already have an understanding of the topic</li>
  <li>assumes the user has some expert knowledge that will allow them to understand the guidance and take action</li>
  <li>is created by government departments using Whitehall publisher</li>
</ul>
<p>Specialist guidance does not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>promote government initiatives or policies - use the <a href="/guidance/content-design/campaigns-on-gov-uk-standards-and-guidelines">campaigns platform</a> or other channels to support marketing or promotional activity, or use a news story or press release for announcements</li>
  <li>explain the policy behind the guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>Some users want to know the detail of policy, but <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/02/rethinking-the-gov-uk-policy-format-what-our-users-told-us/" rel="external">analysis and research</a> has shown that they’re rarely the same users as those looking for guidance.</p>
<p>The detail of policies should be in a policy paper or one of the other formats that help users understand what government is doing.</p>
<p>Specialist guidance should not duplicate mainstream guidance. It can include a specific part of a mainstream task if it only needs to be done by a small proportion of users. For example, it should not take specialist knowledge to understand National Insurance, but only some users will need to understand <a href="/national-insurance/how-much-you-pay">National Insurance for share fishermen</a>.</p>

    <p>You need to get approval from GDS before you create any new government website or public-facing domain. This approval is known as getting an ‘exemption’ and applies to both gov.uk and non-government domains (like org.uk, co.uk or .com).</p>
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Getting an exemption from GDS is not the only approval you’ll need. You must also make sure you have the correct <a href="/guidance/digital-and-technology-spend-controls-version-5">spend approval</a> before you create your website.</p>
</div>
<p>There is separate guidance on:</p>

  <li><a href="/government/publications/naming-and-registering-government-websites/central-government-naming-and-registering-websites">website and email domains</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>How to request an exemption</h3>
<p><a href="/government/publications/apply-for-an-exemption-from-govuk">Complete the exemption form</a> to request an exemption from GOV.UK.</p>
<p>You’ll need to include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>why the user need cannot be met on GOV.UK, with supporting evidence</li>
  <li>your proposed domain name</li>
  <li>signed confirmation that your Head of Digital has given their approval</li>
</ul>
<p>Email your completed form to <a href="mailto:domainmanagement@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">domainmanagement@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a> with the subject line ‘Exemption request’.</p>
<h3>After you send an exemption request</h3>
<p>GDS will let you know the decision within 28 days of your request.</p>
<p>You may have to provide further information before a decision is made on your request.</p>
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Do not begin procurement of an external website until your exemption is confirmed and you have spend approval.</p>
</div>
<h3>If you get an exemption</h3>
<p>You’ll need <a href="/guidance/digital-and-technology-spend-controls-version-5">spend approval</a> even if you get an exemption.</p>
<p>Your website must also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>not duplicate or compete with existing content on either GOV.UK or other exempt government websites or services</li>
  <li>have appropriate journeys to and from GOV.UK for relevant content</li>
  <li>limit its scope to what was agreed for the exemption</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also make sure your website meets the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>same <a href="/service-manual/service-standard">design standards</a> as a service</li>
  <li><a href="/government/publications/the-minimum-cyber-security-standard">Minimum Cyber Security Standard</a></li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>GDS will carry out a full review of your website 6 months after you get your exemption to make sure it still meets the conditions agreed. If you do not meet the conditions, GDS has the right to close the website.</p>
<h3>If you do not get an exemption</h3>
<p>You cannot create your website if you do not get an exemption.</p>
<p>If you already created a website before you applied and you are not granted an exemption, you’ll need to work with GDS to shut it down and migrate appropriate content to GOV.UK.</p>
<p>Exemptions can be revoked. If this happens, you may have to work with GDS to migrate content to GOV.UK.</p>
<h4>Migrate content and close your website</h4>
<p>The steps to close your website are:</p>
<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Do a proposition audit - work with the GOV.UK Policy and Strategy team to identify whether any of the content from your website should be on GOV.UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do a content audit - work with the GOV.UK content design team at GDS to understand where content should go on GOV.UK, and whether it duplicates existing content on the website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree a date for website closure with GDS, based on the outputs from the 2 audits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Migrate content to GOV.UK - work with the GDS content design team to migrate relevant content to GOV.UK, and ensure that website redirects to GOV.UK are set up for the day of website closure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You must <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/webarchive/guidance/" rel="external">make sure the National Archives holds a copy of the website</a> before it closes.</p>

    <p>You need to make sure you choose the right content type when you create content about what government is doing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a look at your source content and <a href="/guidance/content-design/content-types/">review available content types</a> to choose which format to use</li>

<div class="gem-c-govspeak govuk-govspeak " data-module="govspeak">
    <p>These are the relevant formats to use when the government talks about what it’s doing. The following real life examples show how you might meet users’ needs for information about government policy. They’re intended as illustrations.</p>
<h3>Top-level introductions to policy</h3>
<p><a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/02/rethinking-the-gov-uk-policy-format-what-our-users-told-us/" rel="external">Analysis and research</a> shows there is little audience for top-level introductions to policy compared with task-focused guidance content.</p>
<p>However, sometimes there’s a need to explain government activity in brief, without going into the level of detail that users of the ‘policy paper’ format expect.</p>
<p>The best way to know how to publish this is to explore the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/user-needs">user need</a> more closely. How and why will users find this information? It’s bad content design practice to burden users with information that’s irrelevant to what they need right now.</p>
<h4>Policy in guidance</h4>
<p>Around 80% of page visits on GOV.UK are to guidance to help users complete a task or interaction with government. Most people <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/blah-blah-text-keep-cut-or-kill/" rel="external">will not read background text</a> that’s not relevant to the task they’re performing.</p>
<p>Some users want to know the detail of policy, but they are not the same users as people looking for guidance.</p>
<p>Guidance on how to apply for a programme or scheme should not include more than 1 or 2 sentences about what the programme is.</p>
<p>Guidance should not include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>why it exists (the problem being solved)</li>
  <li>how much money has been allocated to it</li>
  <li>who runs it</li>
  <li>aspirational statements about the intended outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#policy-paper">policy paper</a> or other formats explained in the scenarios in this guidance.</p>
<h3>Scenario 1: announcing a new policy or activity</h3>
<p>There are a number of formats you can use to tell users about a new policy or activity.</p>
<p>These formats include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#press-release">press releases</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#speech">speeches</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#news-story">news stories</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/blogging">blog posts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are sufficient to announce something new until more specific information is available.</p>
<p>An example announcement is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-plans-to-reshape-workplace-pensions">Government sets out plans to reshape workplace pensions</a>.</p>
<h3>Scenario 2: policy top-level introductions</h3>
<p>Use a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#policy-paper">policy paper</a> to set the context and reasoning behind a policy.</p>
<p>This means you can explain the intentions and research behind a policy separately from information about how it’s being implemented.</p>
<h3>Scenario 3: government activity top-level introductions</h3>
<p>If this information is brief, you can add it to a relevant <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/organisation-pages">corporate information page</a>. For example, use a ‘Petitions and campaigns’ page for policy information about a campaign.</p>
<p>You can alternatively use a policy paper to explain what the government is doing about a particular policy or issue. This might include information about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>how the government is implementing a policy</li>
  <li>how much money is being spent</li>
</ul>
<p>You can group a number of related publications for a known audience in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#document-collection">document collection</a>.</p>
<p>This allows users to find all the information about a distinct government activity in 1 place.</p>
<h3>Scenario 4: more detail about an aspect of the policy</h3>
<p>Detail about the policy should be part of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#policy-paper">policy paper</a>.</p>
<p>This could include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the outcome the government is trying to achieve</li>
  <li>actions the government is taking to achieve the outcome</li>
  <li>why the government is doing this activity</li>
  <li>the background to this policy</li>
  <li>the budget and timescale for the policy actions</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/whitehall-publisher-policy-paper-format">How the Charity Commission solves safeguarding problems in charities</a>.</p>
<h3>Scenario 5: telling users that something may change in the future</h3>
<p>To tell users that something is changing and they may need to do it differently in the future, use a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#news-story">news story</a>. This includes new schemes they may be able to apply for or services they may be able to use.</p>
<p>Make sure this news story is user-focused. Make it as short and factual as possible. For example, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/transit-visa-requirements-are-changing">Transit visa requirements are changing</a>.</p>
<h3>Scenario 6: telling users they may need to do something now to prepare for a change in the future</h3>
<p>Sometimes a change to a policy, scheme or service will either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>mean that users need to do something to prepare</li>
  <li>affect a major decision citizens or businesses need to make now</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s clear evidence of this, use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/planning-content#where-to-put-guidance">guidance content</a> to tell users about how upcoming changes will affect them now. You may also need to publish a short, factual, user-focused <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/content-types#news-story">news story</a> to announce the changes.</p>
<p>There’s guidance on how to plan and create content to <a href="/guidance/content-design/helping-users-prepare-for-change">help users prepare for policy changes</a>.</p>

    <p>Only tell users about changes to policies, schemes or processes before they come into effect if all the following apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s certain or very likely that the change will happen</li>
  <li>it affects decisions users are going to make now or very soon</li>
  <li>there’s something different users will need to do (not just “be aware of” - for example, they’ll need to apply earlier or apply for a different scheme)</li>
</ul>
<p>Always tell users in advance if the change is related to the end of the transition period with the EU.</p>
<p>Do not publish ‘everything you need to know’ pages for specific audiences as these are never comprehensive and can be hard to navigate.</p>

    <p>GOV.UK content and services need to be as accessible and usable as possible. Government has a legal obligation to make sure people can access the information we produce. This includes users with visual, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments, as well as those with learning difficulties.</p>

    <p>Documents created in open formats can be opened with either free or paid-for software.</p>
<p>This means they:</p>
<ul>
  <li>can be read and used by more people</li>
  <li>help people to share their work more easily</li>
  <li>make it easier and cheaper to do business with government</li>
</ul>
<p>The government is committed to publishing documents (including text, presentations, charts and graphs) <a href="/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles#open-standard---definition">using open standards</a>.</p>
<p>If you publish a PDF or other non-HTML document without an accessible version, <a href="/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">you may be breaking the law</a>.</p>

<h3>Whitehall Publisher: publishing documents designed to be viewed</h3>
<p>The <a href="/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/viewing-government-documents">document ‘viewing’ standards</a> apply to documents that users are meant to read, rather than to edit or interact with.</p>
<p><a href="/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/creating-and-updating-pages#html-documents">Publish Whitehall documents in HTML</a> if they are designed to be viewed (rather than edited, such as a form). For example, a corporate report.</p>
<h3>Whitehall Publisher: publishing documents designed to be edited</h3>
<p>If users need to input information, create an OpenDocument (for example .odt or .ods) and publish it with a version in at least one other format. Whichever other format you choose, you must make it as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>You must give users more than one format to choose from. This is to make sure they can access the information without the need for certain software. OpenDocuments are more accessible than PDFs for users of assistive technologies but there are issues opening some format types on some devices.</p>
<p>You must also let the users know how to contact you to request a different accessible version of the form. You can do this by leaving the ‘Attachment is accessible’ box unticked for all versions of the form when you upload them. This is important even if you publish accessible versions - some users will always need information in other formats, like British Sign Language (BSL), audio or braille.</p>
<p>You must keep the formatting simple in your OpenDocument. Read about <a href="/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/creating-and-updating-pages#formatting-attachments">how to create an OpenDocument with simple formatting</a>.</p>
<p>You may also want to talk to your organisation’s digital team about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">creating a digital service</a> so the user can provide the information online.</p>
<h3>Whitehall publisher: publishing documents designed for print</h3>
<p>You can publish a PDF if it’s a document which was designed to be printed and read on paper, for example, promotional material, a booklet or a leaflet.</p>
<p>You must publish an accessible version with it - either HTML or OpenDocument. If you do not, <a href="/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">you may be breaking the law</a>.</p>
<h3>Whitehall Publisher: Easy Read and unsupported languages</h3>
<p>It is not currently possible to publish HTML Easy Read format documents with the image on the left and the text on the right. Use PDF and follow the <a href="/government/publications/inclusive-communication/accessible-communication-formats#easy-read-and-makaton">Easy Read format guidance</a>. Make sure you provide a way for users to request an accessible version.</p>
<p>If a language is not supported in HTML by Whitehall Publisher, for example Albanian or Bosnian, you should publish your document in both .odt and PDF format if possible. If your document contains read-only information, you can publish it as a PDF. Make sure you provide a way for users to request an accessible version.</p>
<h3>Specialist Publisher</h3>
<p>HTML is not available in Specialist Publisher. Publish an OpenDocument along with the Word or Excel source document.</p>
<p>There is one exception to publishing OpenDocuments in Specialist Publisher: documents that could be misused if edited can be published as PDF. Examples of this are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/employment-tribunal-decisions">employment tribunal decisions</a></li>
  <li><a href="/asylum-support-tribunal-decisions">asylum support tribunal decisions</a></li>
  <li><a href="/drug-device-alerts">alerts and recalls for drugs and medical devices</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Other GOV.UK publishing platforms</h3>
<p>For documents designed to be viewed, publish in HTML where the publishing platform allows it.</p>
<p>For documents designed to be edited, publish in OpenDocument format.</p>
<p>HTML is not available in Travel Advice Publisher - you should publish OpenDocuments.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The <a href="/guidance/content-design/planning-content#data">open standards rules</a> do not apply to datasets designed only to be machine readable by external software.</p>
<p>If you currently publish data as .csv files, it’s fine to continue doing this.</p>
<p>If you need to publish structured data like tables or spreadsheets, you should use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>.ods - an open format that can be used in free, open or proprietary licensed software</li>
  <li>.csv - a machine-readable format which enables users to process the data it contains</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use .csv files for data that people (rather than machines) need to read.</p>
<p>Avoid publishing statistical tables or datasets within a PDF or other format designed mainly for text. This is because it makes it difficult for users who rely on assistive technology such as screen readers which speak the text on a page. This can include visually impaired and Dyslexic people. Instead, try to provide them separately using .ods or .csv.</p>
<p>The Government Statistical Service has published detailed guidance on <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/" rel="external">releasing statistics in accessible spreadsheets</a>.</p>

    <p>GOV.UK URLs (web addresses) are designed to follow a consistent, predictable, user-friendly format.</p>
<p>Most URLs are generated automatically when a page is created in Whitehall publisher. However, short or ‘friendly’ URLs are sometimes created for promotional purposes. If you need a short URL, you need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>read the GOV.UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/url-standards-for-gov-uk">URL standards</a> to check if your request is eligible</li>
