<h2>The Defence Recovery Capability</h2>

<p>The Defence recovery Capability is a <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>-owned capability designed to deliver programmed, command-led and coordinated support to wounded, injured and sick serving personnel. It is delivered through single Service (sS) Recovery Pathways, drawing on the resources of sS led Personnel Recovery organisations, including the Naval Service Recovery Centre (NSRC), Personnel Recovery Units (<abbr title="Personnel Recovery Unit">PRU</abbr>), Personnel Recovery Centres (<abbr title="Personnel Recovery Centres">PRCs</abbr>), and the Battle Back Centre (BBC). The Recovery Pathways are aligned with clinical treatment and rehabilitation, but do not deliver mental or physical treatment or rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Recovery activity under the Defence Recovery Capability ensures that wounded, injured and sick personnel have access to all the key services and resources needed to help them either return to duty or make a smooth transition to an appropriately skilled civilian life.  This care is delivered across the defence community by the combined efforts of the Services and the Service charities responding to carefully tailored individual recovery plans setting out a recovery pathway.</p>

<h2>Individual Recovery Plan</h2>

<p>Each person who comes under the Defence Recovery Capability will get a tailored <strong>Individual Recovery Plan (<abbr title="Individual Recovery Plan">IRP</abbr>)</strong> which enables them to focus on their outcome, either their return to duty or transition to civilian life.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Individual Recovery Plan">IRP</abbr> delivers the individual recovery pathway focussed on achieving a successful recovery outcome. The <abbr title="Individual Recovery Plan">IRP</abbr> is a critical path to delivering a successful outcome, utilising Specific, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) objectives is critical to achieving the desired outcome. The <abbr title="Individual Recovery Plan">IRP</abbr> incorporates all aspects of an individual’s recovery including medical, welfare, housing, education, re-skilling, Return to Work (RtW) Programmes, work placements and employment opportunities. An interdisciplinary approach is taken utilising all available subject matter experts to analyse, develop, deliver and assess effectiveness. The designated Recovery officer will work with wounded, injured and sick personnel under their command to create a tailored <abbr title="Individual Recovery Plan">IRP</abbr> to enable them to focus on their outcome.</p>

<h2>Personnel Recovery Units</h2>

<p>If an individual’s case is particularly complex they could be transferred to a Personnel Recovery Unit (<abbr title="Personnel Recovery Unit">PRU</abbr>). A <abbr title="Personnel Recovery Unit">PRU</abbr> will ensure they receive a consistent and high quality command and care provision that will deliver the right outcome for the individual and the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>.</p>

<p>There are four PRUs led by the Army and located within the major garrison areas. Command of the Army Recovery Capability rests with HQ Regional Command and each Army <abbr title="Personnel Recovery Unit">PRU</abbr> directly advises and assists all army units within their respective operating areas.</p>

<p>The RAF <abbr title="Personnel Recovery Unit">PRU</abbr> is the authority for RAF Recovery Activity and has oversight of all RAF wounded, injured and sick personnel. It is the focal point for RAF Recovery Activity providing advice and guidance to the RAF on Recovery.</p>

<p>Royal Navy wounded injured and sick service personnel with the most complex recovery needs are reviewed by a Naval Service Casualty Cell (NSCC) and assigned to the Hasler Naval Service Recovery Centre (NSRC) in HMS Drake. Hasler Company is based in HMS Drake, Plymouth, also provides additional facilities, command, management and administrative support specifically for those wounded, injured and sick personnel across the armed forces with complex long term injuries and illnesses, and was established in HMS Drake in 2009.</p>

<p>Those wounded injured and sick service personnel who meet the Naval Service Recovery Pathway entry criteria are assigned to the Personnel Support Groups (PSG) located in the Portsmouth, Devonport and Faslane Naval bases, or the Career Management Cells (CMC) in Yeovilton and Culdrose air stations, or the Recovery Troops (RT) established in 40, 42 or 45 Cdo units. Those WIS who remain broadly employable and with less demanding recovery needs remain in their parent unit or are assigned to the PSG in their base port.</p>

<h2>Personnel Recovery Centres</h2>

<p>The Personnel Recovery Centres (<abbr title="Personnel Recovery Centres">PRCs</abbr>) offer a residential capacity to those wounded, injured and sick personnel from across the armed forces undergoing recovery as well as providing facilities for day attendees; they are not hospitals, rehabilitation or physiotherapy centres. Individuals assigned to a recovery centre must be self-medicating and independently mobile.</p>

<p>The centres are in major garrisons in the UK and are able to take advantage of the full range of welfare, medical, rehabilitation, education and resettlement facilities.</p>

<p>The Personnel Recovery Centres are open to serving wounded, injured and sick personnel of the Armed Forces  on a case by case priority basis. The centres have been designed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create a conducive military environment where wounded, injured and sick personnel can recover</li>
  <li>facilitate and conduct recovery courses and activities in support of individual recovery plans</li>
  <li>offer a secure base for wounded, injured and sick personnel throughout the duration of their recovery</li>
  <li>act as a launch point for other recovery activities such as Battle Back activities, Graduated Return to Work programmes, work placements and mandatory army training tests</li>
</ul>
