<p>The <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> (UK Conformity Assessed) marking is a new UK product marking that is used for goods being placed on the market in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). It covers most goods which previously required the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking alone cannot be used for goods placed on the Northern Ireland market, which require the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> or UKNI marking. See the guidance on <a href="https:///www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-market-in-northern-ireland" rel="external" class="govuk-link">placing goods on the Northern Ireland market</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance explains how to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking. For further information on placing these goods on the market, see the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-market-in-great-britain">placing manufactured goods on the market in Great Britain</a>.</p>

<h2>Check whether you need to use the new <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h2>

<h3>Selling goods in Great Britain</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking applies to most goods previously subject to the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>. It also applies to aerosol products that previously required the ‘reverse epsilon’ marking.</p>

<p>The technical requirements (‘essential requirements’) you must meet – and the conformity assessment processes and standards that can be used to demonstrate conformity – are largely the same as they were for the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which you can use self-declaration of conformity for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking are the same as for <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr>. <a href="#self-declaration" class="govuk-link">Check the list of areas where self-declaration is permitted</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking came into effect on 1 January 2021. However, to allow businesses time to adjust to the new requirements, you will still be able to use the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> until 1 January 2022 in most cases.</p>

<p>In some cases, you need to apply the new <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking to goods being sold in Great Britain immediately from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> is only valid in Great Britain for areas where <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules remain the same. If the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> changes its rules and you CE mark your product on the basis of those new rules you will not be able to use the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> to sell in Great Britain, even before 31 December 2021.</p>

<p>Check whether you will need to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking by reading the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-market-in-great-britain" class="govuk-link">guidance on placing manufactured goods on the market in Great Britain</a>.</p>

<h3>Selling goods in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking is not recognised on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market. Products need a <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> for sale in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking">Find out how to use the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>When to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h2>

<p>You only need to use the new <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking before 1 January 2022 if all of the following apply. Your product:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is for the market in Great Britain</li>
  <li>is covered by legislation which requires the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</li>
  <li>requires mandatory third-party conformity assessment</li>
  <li>conformity assessment has been carried out by a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conformity-assessment-bodies-change-of-status-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">UK conformity assessment body</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This does not apply to existing stock, for example if your good was fully manufactured, CE marked and ready to place on the market before 1 January 2021. In these cases, your good can still be sold in Great Britain with a <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> even if covered by a certificate of conformity issued by a UK body before 1 January 2021.</p>

<h2>How to use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h2>

<h3>Placing the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h3>

<p>In most cases, you must apply the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking to the product itself or to the packaging. In some cases, it may be placed on the manuals or on other supporting literature. This will vary depending on the specific regulations that apply to the product.</p>

<p>The following general rules apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> markings must only be placed on a product by you as the manufacturer or your authorised representative (where allowed for in the relevant legislation)</li>
  <li>when attaching the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking, you take full responsibility for your product’s conformity with the requirements of the relevant legislation</li>
  <li>you must only use the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking to show product conformity with the relevant UK legislation</li>
  <li>you must not place any marking or sign that may misconstrue the meaning or form of the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking to third parties</li>
  <li>you must not attach other markings on the product which affect the visibility, legibility or meaning of the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking cannot be placed on products unless there is a specific requirement to do so in the legislation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules for using the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> image</h3>

<p>You must make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you reduce or enlarge the size of your marking, the letters forming the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking must be in proportion to the version set out below</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking is at least 5mm in height for the whole logo, not individual letters  – unless a different minimum dimension is specified in the relevant legislation</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking is easily visible, legible (from 1 January 2023 it must be permanently attached)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</div>

<h2>Technical documentation</h2>

<h3>Record keeping</h3>

<p>You, or your authorised representative (where allowed for in the relevant legislation), must keep documentation to demonstrate that your product conforms with the regulatory requirements. This must be kept for up to 10 years after the product is placed on the market.</p>

<p>This information can be requested at any time by market surveillance or enforcement authorities to check that your product conforms with the statutory requirements.</p>

<p>The information you must keep will vary depending on the specific legislation relevant to your product. You must keep general records of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the product is designed and manufactured</li>
  <li>how the product has been shown to conform to the relevant requirements</li>
  <li>the addresses of the manufacturer and any storage facilities</li>
</ul>

<p>You should keep the information in the form of a technical file which can be supplied if requested by a market surveillance authority.</p>

<h3>UK Declaration of Conformity</h3>

<p>The UK Declaration of Conformity is a document which must be drawn up for most products lawfully bearing a <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking.</p>

<p>In the document you as the manufacturer, or your authorised representative (where allowed for in the relevant legislation), should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>declare that the product is in conformity with the relevant statutory requirements applicable to the specific product</li>
  <li>make sure the document has the name and address of the manufacturer (or your authorised representative) together with information about the product and the conformity assessment body (where relevant)</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK Declaration of Conformity should be available to market surveillance authorities on request.</p>

<p>The information required on the Declaration of Conformity is largely the same as what was required on an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Declaration of Conformity. This can vary depending on the application legislation but generally should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name and full business address or that of your authorised representative</li>
  <li>the product’s serial number, model or type identification</li>
  <li>a statement, stating you take full responsibility for the product’s compliance</li>
  <li>the details of the approved body which carried out the conformity assessment procedure (if applicable)</li>
  <li>the relevant legislation with which the product complies</li>
  <li>your name and signature</li>
  <li>the date the declaration was issued</li>
  <li>supplementary information (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to list:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/953948/uk-eu-legislation-list.ods">relevant UK legislation (rather than <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation)</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="OpenDocument Spreadsheet">ODS</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">5.08KB</span>)</span></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/designated-standards">UK designated standards</a> rather than standards cited in the Official Journal of the European Union</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK standards are currently the same in substance and with the same reference as the standards used in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Future use of markings in the UK</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2022, the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> will not be recognised in Great Britain for areas covered by this guidance and the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking. However, a product bearing the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> would still be valid for sale in the UK so long as it was also <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marked and complied with the relevant UK rules. Separate rules apply to medical devices.</p>

<h3>Transitional measures relating to the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking</h3>

<p>For many product types (listed above), the following transitional measures apply.</p>

<p>Until 1 January 2023, for most goods (other than those subject to special rules) you have the option to affix the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking on a label affixed to the product or on an accompanying document. The economic operators (whether manufacturer, importer or distributor) should take reasonable steps to ensure the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking remains in place. Products that require the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking cannot be made available without it (other than where the <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE marking</abbr> is being used before 1 January 2022).</p>

<p>From 1 January 2023, the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking must, in most cases, be affixed directly to the product. You should start building this into your design process ready for this date.</p>

<p>Construction products, medical devices, interoperability of the rail system and transportable pressure equipment are covered by the <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking, however the above transitional measures are not applicable.</p>
