<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) buys copyright licences for all state-funded primary and secondary schools in England – covering schools for almost all their copyright requirements.</p>

<p>Purchasing these licences directly means that <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> can save schools money and the administrative time involved in applying for many different licences.</p>

<p>The licences mean you can copy, re-use and share content from a wide range of sources within your school for non-commercial, educational purposes.</p>

<p>Your school leadership (head and chair of governors) needs to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all intended activities are covered adequately by the licences</li>
  <li>all staff follow the terms and conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on what content you can use, and how to gain other permissions, contact the relevant organisation from the following list.</p>

<p>The copyright licences cover a range of content from printed materials to radio and TV broadcasts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cla.co.uk/cla-schools-licence" rel="external">Copyright Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Copyright Licensing Agency">CLA</abbr>)</a>, for copying text and still images from most books, journals and magazines plus a range of digital publications</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.printmusiclicensing.co.uk/for-schools/" rel="external">Printed Music Licencing Ltd (<abbr title="Printed Music Licencing Ltd">PMLL</abbr>)</a> provides the Schools Printed Music Licence (<abbr title="Schools Printed Music Licence">SPML</abbr>) which allows a copy or arrangement to be made of sheet music from printed music publications. The licence is administered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cefm.co.uk/" rel="external">Centre for Education and Finance Management (CEFM)</a>. The collection of information on works copied and arranged under the licence is operated by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.everycopycounts.co.uk/" rel="external">Every Copy Counts</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.newspapersforschools.co.uk/" rel="external">NLA Media Access</a>, for copying from newspapers and magazines. The Copyright Licensing Agency administers this licence and has information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cla.co.uk/nla-schools-licence" rel="external">copying from print and digital newspapers</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.era.org.uk/" rel="external">Educational Recording Agency</a>, for recording and use of radio and television programmes and clips, including catch-up services like BBC iPlayer, for educational use. The Centre for Education &amp; Finance Management administers this licence and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cefm.co.uk/licensing/era_schools/" rel="external">operates a helpdesk for schools providing information about the licence</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.prsformusic.com" rel="external">Performing Right Society Ltd</a>, for musical performances. The Centre for Education and Finance Management administers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cefm.co.uk/licensing/school/" rel="external">this licence</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ppluk.com" rel="external">Phonographic Performance Ltd</a>, for playing recorded music. The Centre for Education and Finance Management administers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cefm.co.uk/licensing/pplschools/" rel="external">this licence</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.prsformusic.com" rel="external">The Mechanical Copyright Protection Society</a>, for making <abbr title="compact discs">CDs</abbr> and <abbr title="digital video discs">DVDs</abbr> containing copyright music. The Centre for Education and Finance Management administers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cefm.co.uk/licensing/mcps/" rel="external">this licence</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.filmbankmedia.com/licences/pvsl/education-sector/special-notices-english-schools/" rel="external">Filmbankmedia</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.themplc.co.uk/" rel="external">Motion Picture Licensing Company</a> for showing films</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://uk.ccli.com/" rel="external">Christian Copyright Licensing International</a> for copying and projecting hymns and other Christian music</li>
</ul>

<p>If you require a copy of any of these licences, or further information about them, you should contact the relevant copyright management organisation (or, where applicable, its agent) listed above.</p>

<p>We encourage schools to make the best use of these licences. For example, the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://era.org.uk/" rel="external">Educational Recording Agency</a> offers links to broadcast resources and provides a collection of case studies showing how teachers use television and radio effectively in their lessons.</p>

<p>The Mechanical Copyright Protection Society licence allows schools to make recordings of student performances and sell copies to generate income.</p>

<p>The licences don’t cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>images on websites, unless the website is covered by the <abbr title="Copyright Licensing Agency">CLA</abbr> or NLA Media Access – you can check using <abbr title="Copyright Licensing Agency">CLA</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cla.co.uk/cla-schools-licence" rel="external">Check Permissions tool</a>
</li>
  <li>content accessed directly from YouTube</li>
  <li>some extra-curricular activities, for example showing films to a paying audience; please contact the relevant organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Copyright Licensing Agency">CLA</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cla.co.uk/cla-schools-licence" rel="external">Check Permissions tool</a> enables you to check whether you can copy from a particular publication under the terms of the <abbr title="Copyright Licensing Agency">CLA</abbr> and NLA Media Access licences. (Remember that images copied under these licences are covered for internal distribution within the school, but not for sharing on a public facing website.) It also helps you to check whether you can copy from a particular publication under the terms of the Schools Printed Music Licence.</p>

<p>You can also use the <abbr title="Copyright Licensing Agency">CLA</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationplatform.co.uk/" rel="external">Education Platform</a> if your school is covered by the <abbr title="Copyright Licensing Agency">CLA</abbr> Education Licence. The platform provides access to digital versions of books, allowing you to copy and share a portion of each book you or your school owns.</p>

<p>Teachers can access free resources by using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.everycopycounts.co.uk" rel="external">Every Copy Counts</a>, the data collection programme for the <abbr title="Schools Printed Music Licence">SPML</abbr>. Resources available include approaches to composing and songwriting,  webinars on composers and guides to careers in the music publishing industry. These are available through the resource section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmll.org.uk/about-us/" rel="external"><abbr title="Printed Music Licencing Ltd">PMLL</abbr></a> portal, in return for submitting information on the works used under the licence.</p>

<p>Educational establishments covered by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local-authority-maintained schools (including maintained nurseries)</li>
  <li>academies</li>
  <li>free schools</li>
  <li>special schools (these are schools for children with special educational needs or disabilities)</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units (these provide education for children who can’t attend a mainstream school)</li>
</ul>
