<p>On 17 March 2020, all routine inspections of schools, further education, early years and social care providers were suspended. Urgent inspections where specific concerns have been raised are still going ahead. This allows us to prioritise the immediate safety of children where necessary. As far as we are able, we are continuing our important <a class="govuk-link" href="#regulatory-work">regulatory work</a>.</p>

<p>We have also updated our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferring-ofsted-inspections" class="govuk-link">deferral policy</a>, including a section on deferrals during this period.</p>

<p>We are in daily contact with the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) to discuss the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact across education and social care.</p>

<h2>Current activity</h2>

<h3>Schools and further education</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/january-2021-maintained-schools-and-academies">Remote monitoring inspections of schools</a> graded ‘inadequate’ or ‘requires improvement’ and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/january-2021-further-education-and-skills-providers" class="govuk-link">further education providers</a> began on 25 January, with a particular focus on how well children and learners are being <a href="#remote-ed" class="govuk-link">educated remotely</a>. These inspections are not graded.</p>

<p>We will pause our inspections of schools and colleges for the week beginning 8 March, while they are focused on reopening to all pupils.</p>

<p>For the rest of the term, we will continue to carry out our monitoring inspections remotely by default (with the exception of new provider monitoring visits to further education providers, which require site visits). However, we will carry out on-site inspections if we have any immediate concerns – for example, about safeguarding or the leadership of a school.</p>

<p>Remote monitoring inspections of maintained schools and academies will normally last for one day and involve 2 <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspectors">HMI</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Registered early years and social care provision</h3>

<p>We continue to plan for a safe and phased return to routine inspection for early years providers. We paused our programme of assurance inspections in January this year because of national restrictions. We are planning to return to full graded inspections as soon as we can in the summer term. Therefore, we have decided not to restart assurance inspections this term as restrictions ease, but we will keep these plans under review.</p>

<p>We will continue with our vital regulatory work in early years and children’s social care. This work will sometimes require on-site visits, which will be risk assessed based on the nature of the premises and the urgency of the work. As always, the safety and well-being of children is our priority and we will take urgent action where we have concerns.</p>

<p>We will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue with on-site visits where we have urgent safeguarding concerns</li>
  <li>continue with assurance visits to independent fostering agencies, which we will usually be able to carry out remotely</li>
  <li>carry out monitoring visits, as necessary, to children’s homes and other settings. Monitoring visits will continue to be a combination of on site/off site/blended, as appropriate</li>
  <li>continue with our registration work, carefully risk assessed in line with government guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>We will keep these plans under review. As with all visits, we will put considerable measures in place to ensure the safety of all concerned.</p>

<p>As routine inspections are currently suspended, and a provider’s next inspection date is not currently known, we may carry out further on- or off-site regulatory work if we have information that we were holding for the next inspection. We will publish an outcome summary if we need to take any action.</p>

<h3>Unregistered schools</h3>

<p>Our inspections of unregistered schools are criminal investigations of settings that put children at significant risk. Each case is individually risk assessed and, where required, all inspections are on site. This is because remote inspection does not give us the scope to gather evidence in line with the relevant criminal investigation standards.</p>

<h2>Remote education</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has set out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">requirements for schools to provide high-quality remote education</a> when children are unable to attend school.</p>

<p>We will look at how well schools are educating pupils in the current circumstances – which, for most pupils, means being educated remotely until 8 March. We will also consider complaints made by parents about remote education to help resolve issues and make sure children are being well served. If parents feel their child’s school is not providing suitable remote education, they should first raise their concerns with the teacher or headteacher. If issues are not resolved, <a href="https://contact.ofsted.gov.uk/online-complaints" class="govuk-link" rel="external">parents can report the matter to Ofsted</a>.</p>

<p>We have published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/whats-working-well-in-remote-education/whats-working-well-in-remote-education" class="govuk-link">short guide on what works well in remote education</a>.</p>

<h2>Our phased return to inspection</h2>

<p>We are discussing the form and timing of inspections in the summer term and beyond with government and stakeholders.</p>

<h2>Sending us documents and forms</h2>

<p>Please use our online forms, if possible, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/providing-childcare-services-in-england" class="govuk-link">early years</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/becoming-and-running-a-childrens-social-care-service">social care</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If we have previously asked you to post documents to us, please either scan or photograph them and send with your unique reference number (<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>) to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk">enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You can find your <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> on your registration, your inspection report(s), and on your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk" rel="external">Ofsted reports page</a>.</p>

<p>Due to COVID-19 (coronavirus), there are likely to be delays in reviewing incoming post.</p>

<h3>Data from local authorities</h3>

<p>We have considered whether we should minimise, defer or cancel the data collections we ask local authorities to give us, in order to reduce the burden on them during this time. As a result, we have adjusted collection timescales to account for the beginning of lockdown and the need for emergency planning time, and we have reduced the amount of data we request. We do not anticipate a delay in the publication of any social care national statistics as a result of these changes.</p>

<p>Also, local authorities are required to provide data on individual children when we need to carry out an emergency inspection due to safeguarding concerns.</p>

<h2>Regulatory activity and urgent monitoring visits</h2>

<p>This section applies only to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>early years and childcare providers</li>
  <li>children’s social care providers that we inspect under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/social-care-common-inspection-framework-sccif" class="govuk-link">the social care common inspection framework (<abbr title="social care common inspection framework">SCCIF</abbr>)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Ofsted resumed inspecting providers on the Childcare Register and began a programme of visits in September 2020. All other routine inspections are suspended. However, we continue our important regulatory work to help maintain social care (<abbr title="social care">SC</abbr>) provision for the most vulnerable children, and the registration of vital early years (<abbr title="early years">EY</abbr>) services. This includes reviewing notifications from providers and other information we receive.</p>

<p>We have temporarily adjusted our regulatory activity to focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provision that causes us concern</li>
  <li>the need to register new provision</li>
  <li>expansion to existing provision</li>
</ul>

<h3>Off-site activity</h3>

<p>We will decide what needs to be done on or off site on a case-by-case basis, considering the lines of enquiry and the apparent level of risk.</p>

<p>The inspector may ask the provider to share more electronic evidence than usual. This evidence will vary, but may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>photographs of premises such as repairs and decoration (and/or having a tour of the building through a video call)</li>
  <li>safety certificates</li>
  <li>confirmation of building works, such as invoices</li>
  <li>updated policies</li>
  <li>updated action plans</li>
  <li>staffing lists to confirm that the provider has enough staff to re-open</li>
  <li>staff training records and/or a careful risk assessment and plan for training (including e-learning, given the current circumstances)</li>
</ul>

<h3>On-site visits to social care providers</h3>

<p>In addition to assurance visits, we may carry out on-site visits to social care providers when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>off-site inspection activity has not provided enough evidence that children are safe</li>
  <li>we have received concerns that we can only fully consider through an on-site visit</li>
  <li>we must visit to be able to decide whether to take, or to stop taking, regulatory action</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be other circumstances in which we decide that an on-site visit is necessary, but we will decide those on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h4>Urgent monitoring visits to social care providers</h4>

<p>We may announce an urgent monitoring visit so that we can take account of the circumstances, such as whether any children are self-isolating.</p>

<p>In some cases, we may need to visit unannounced. When this happens, the inspector will explain on arrival why they have come and ask the provider to take action so that they can safely enter. The inspector will usually stay outside while they do this.</p>

<p>Inspectors will plan the visit to ensure that they are on site for the minimum amount of time.</p>

<p>The inspector will ask the provider to try to limit the number of children and staff that they will need to see, talk to or meet with. They will ask the provider to help any child who is self-isolating or unwell to stay separate from the inspector. Inspectors will follow government guidance on, for example, washing hands, physical contact and social distancing.</p>

<p>Inspectors will be able to raise statutory requirements and recommendations where relevant. However, these will be focused on the things that are directly affecting the safety and well-being of children. They will take account of what is, and is not, within the provider’s control during this time.</p>

<h3>On-site visits to early years and childcare providers</h3>

<p>When we receive information about a setting, we need to determine what type of activity is needed to mitigate the risk to children. We will make a case by case decision on whether to carry out regulatory work remotely or to visit, or a combination of the two based on our risk assessment.</p>

<p>Inspectors will plan any visit to ensure that they are on site for the minimum amount of time. In announced visits, they will agree in advance with the registered provider what activity they will carry out.</p>

<h3>After any off-site activity or on-site visits</h3>

<p>After carrying out off- or on-site activity, we will usually arrange a case review to decide what further action to take, if any. This may include a decision to go on site.</p>

<h4>Social care providers</h4>

<p>Off-site activity and urgent monitoring visits will not result in a judgement based on the 4-point scale, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/social-care-common-inspection-framework-sccif">as set out in the <abbr title="social care common inspection framework">SCCIF</abbr></a>. However, we will usually publish a report to help local authorities and commissioners in their decision-making. The report will include information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the off-site activity we carried out</li>
  <li>the findings from any on-site visit</li>
  <li>what the provider told us, and the evidence it shared with us</li>
  <li>what action we have decided to take (if any)</li>
  <li>whether we have evidence to suggest that children are not, or are no longer, at risk (where relevant)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Early years and childcare providers</h4>

<p>After our on-site visits or off-site activity, if we take action or ask a provider to take action to meet legal requirements, we will publish an outcome summary on our reports website.</p>

<h2>Children’s social care</h2>

<p>Ofsted began making <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/social-care-common-inspection-framework-sccif" class="govuk-link">assurance visits</a> in September 2020.</p>

<p>We continue to register social care providers and managers. We have made some <a href="#changes-reg" class="govuk-link">changes to the steps we take in completing the registration process</a>. Contact throughout the process will be by a combination of face-to-face, telephone, email or video call. We will keep any visits to a minimum and follow the latest government guidelines, restrictions and safety advice.</p>

<p>The Children’s Commissioner for England has issued a <a href="https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/publication/childrens-guide-to-coronavirus" class="govuk-link" rel="external">children’s guide to coronavirus</a>, which children’s social care providers may find useful.</p>

<h3>Legislation, regulations and statutory guidance</h3>

<p>We do not have the power to disapply or waive legislation, regulation or statutory guidance, for example around regulation 44 inspections. Legislative change is a matter for central government and, ultimately, parliament.</p>

<p>However, we recognise that we are in exceptional circumstances. You will have to make pragmatic decisions in the best interests of children. You should carry out a careful risk assessment of any action you take and keep a clear record of the decisions that you make.</p>

<p>We expect all providers to follow Public Health England’s advice. We expect you to think about alternative ways to keep in contact, supervise provision and maintain oversight, such as using telephone or video conferencing, while recognising the limitations of this approach. We are, of course, sensitive to the challenges that all providers are facing. We take a balanced and proportionate approach to regulation, taking account of how people have tried to satisfy regulatory requirements in these difficult circumstances.</p>

<h3>Notifying Ofsted</h3>

<p>You only need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notify-ofsted-of-an-incident-form-for-childrens-social-care-providers">notify us</a> about incidents that the regulations require you to tell us about. We do not need you to tell us about anything else.</p>

<h3>Foster carer recruitment</h3>

<p>The current regulations allow fostering agencies and services to bring in recently retired or de-registered foster carers, rather like the NHS has done with doctors and nurses.</p>

<p>We expect you to do a careful risk assessment of any action you take and to keep a clear record of the decisions made.</p>

<h3>Senior staff of providers visiting children’s homes</h3>

<p>Senior or regional managers of providers may need to visit children’s homes in person during the current situation. They have responsibilities to safeguard children, and although online and telephone communication may be able to replace some face-to-face aspects of this, providers should retain the option to visit in person when necessary.</p>

<p>All providers need to take a balanced approach to this in the current circumstances. They should follow the government guidance on social distancing where possible.</p>

<h3>Changes to children’s social care registration</h3>

<p>We have made <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-registration-for-childrens-social-care-services/changes-to-childrens-social-care-registration" class="govuk-link">temporary changes to the process for those applying to register social care provision</a> at the moment.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice help-notice" aria-label="Warning">
<p>We have also added a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/registering-childrens-homes-in-an-emergency-as-a-direct-result-of-covid-19-pandemic-fast-track-applications">fast-track application process</a> specifically for registering children’s home provision in an emergency.</p>
</div>

<p>We will still follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-registration-for-childrens-social-care-services">guide to registration of children’s social care services</a> as far as possible.</p>

<h2>Early years and childcare</h2>

<h3>First aid certificates</h3>

<p>If your paediatric first aid (<abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr>) certificate expired on or after 1 October 2020, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has advised that this will be valid until 31 March 2021. After this you will need to have an up to date certificate.</p>

<h3>Early years foundation stage (<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>) requirements</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#early-years-foundation-stage">provided temporary flexibility</a> in meeting some requirements of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2" class="govuk-link">early years foundation stage (<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>) statutory framework</a>. This includes those around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ratios and qualifications of staff</li>
  <li>paediatric first aid (<abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr>) certificates</li>
  <li>learning and development and the progress check at age 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the full <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2/early-years-foundation-stage-coronavirus-disapplications" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance about the coronavirus disapplications and modifications to the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>We will not take enforcement action against providers for not meeting the full <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> requirements, if they are correctly applying the disapplied and modified requirements.</p>

<h3>Notifications</h3>

<p>If you have any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the setting (either child or staff member), or if your setting has been advised to close as a result, you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tell-ofsted-if-you-have-a-covid-19-incident-at-your-childcare-business" class="govuk-link">report this to Ofsted as soon as reasonably practical</a>, and in any case within 14 days. Notifications of confirmed cases of COVID-19 will not prompt a regulatory visit from Ofsted.</p>

<h4>Letting us know if you are open or closed</h4>

<p>We have been working with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and local authorities to find out which early years providers, including childminders, are currently open or temporarily closed. This is to help find out if there is sufficient and accessible childcare available and to help support vulnerable children as best we can.</p>

<p>If your operating circumstances do change (you open or close), email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk">enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk</a> with ‘Change in operating hours’ in the subject field. Please do this even if you have already notified us about a closure due to COVID-19 cases. In the body of the email, please confirm the unique reference number for each setting and the details of the change. You can find your <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> on your registration, your inspection report(s), and on your <a href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Ofsted reports page</a>.</p>

<h3>Fast-track application process</h3>

<p>To support local authorities and registered early years and childcare settings, we have put in place temporary arrangements that allow us to fast-track applications and requests from existing providers only to operate provision in a different way or to set up additional premises.</p>

<p>Contact your local authority for further information.</p>

<h3>Applying for a change in working premises</h3>

<p>Childminders and providers of childcare on domestic premises, can apply to work from non-domestic premises for up to 50% of their time. If you would like to do this, email your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childcare-providers-eya-approval-to-operate-from-non-domestic-premises">application form</a> to <a href="mailto:enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk</a>. We will review the details and contact you as quickly as possible to discuss your request.</p>

<h3>Resigning registrations</h3>

<p>You should tell us if you are resigning your registration. To do this, email <a href="mailto:enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk</a> from your email address that we have on your registration and include your unique reference number (<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>). You can find your <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> on your registration, your inspection report(s), and on your setting’s <a rel="external" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">Ofsted reports page</a>.</p>

<h3>Nannies</h3>

<p>If you are a nanny on the voluntary part of the Childcare Register, you should discuss with the family you work for to see if it is appropriate for you to carry on working at this time.</p>

<p>On 11 September the Secretary of State for Education wrote to Ofsted to request the resumption of inspection of providers registered on the Childcare Register. If you are selected for an inspection, but for safety reasons wish for the inspection to take place outside the home of the children you care for, please discuss this with the inspector when they call. Ofsted inspectors will be flexible given the current challenges of COVID-19 and recognise that providers may be anxious about visitors within a setting. Inspectors will carry out a risk assessment with you about how to manage the visit safely.</p>

<p>If you wish to defer your inspection, we will consider the application for deferral in line with our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferring-ofsted-inspections" class="govuk-link">published policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Information for parents of children in early years provision during this time</h3>

<p>If you have concerns about your child’s early years or childcare provider, you should still try to resolve these directly with the provider in the first instance, as is the case in normal times. You should only inform us if you remain dissatisfied with the provider’s response, or if you have a serious concern about children’s safety and well-being.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has produced guidance about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures">actions for early years and childcare providers during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</a> that you may find helpful.</p>

<p>As in normal circumstances, we have no power to get involved with contractual issues, such as disputes about fees and operating hours. It is up to providers how they charge for their services and the hours that children can attend for. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers#early-years-settings"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s frequently asked questions about funding issues</a> may be helpful.</p>

<h2>Inspection reports and management information</h2>

<p>If we carry out inspections or visits we will publish reports as normal on the <a href="http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Ofsted reports website</a>.</p>

<p>We also continue to publish statistics and transparency information. We paused publishing some management information in April, but we will gradually re-start when additional inspection reports have been published.</p>

<p>The Parent View Management Information due to be published in October will not be published as no school inspections have taken place since the last release.</p>

<h2>Ofsted staff</h2>

<p>During this period, around 700 Ofsted staff have been supporting local authorities, government departments and other organisations with the response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>More than 250 staff have been deployed to local authorities. These colleagues are helping to support vulnerable children, develop safeguarding processes and communicate with school leaders.</p>

<p>A number of qualified staff have been working in children’s homes, and more have volunteered to be emergency foster carers. Colleagues have also been supporting the London Gold group, across all London local authorities, to recruit staff into care settings. Some of our school inspectors have been supporting Star Line, a home-learning parent helpline.</p>

<p>Around 300 staff have been supporting government departments. Staff from across Ofsted – inspectors, administrative staff and other specialists – have been working with the Department of Health and Social Care, the Department for Education and the Department for Work and Pensions. We have also had a small number of colleagues volunteering with the NHS.</p>
