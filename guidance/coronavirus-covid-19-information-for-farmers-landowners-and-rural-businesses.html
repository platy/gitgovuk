<h4>Bank helpline opening hours</h4>
<p>We’re committed to maintain vital services for our customers. However, to safeguard our people during these exceptional times, we’ve had to reduce the bank helpline opening hours.</p>

<p>The Bank helpline is open on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays between 9am and 2pm.</p>

<p>We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and ask that you please bear with us during this time.</p>

<p>We will keep reviewing the situation and publish further updates when available.</p>

<h2>What you need to do</h2>

<p>We’re committed to maintaining vital services for our customers, and have made changes to adapt to the current emergency situation.</p>

<p>In line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">government COVID-19 guidance</a>, the majority of our offices remain closed while our processing and helpline teams carry on their important work from home. We are all fully focused on making vital payments to the rural community and helping customers submit their claims and applications.</p>

<p>To make sure you follow the government advice on social distancing, please do not visit or hand in any correspondence or supporting documents to any of our local offices.</p>

<p>You can continue to post correspondence or supporting documents but only to those <a href="#postal-addresses" class="govuk-link">offices listed below</a>.</p>

<p>To make sure your documents get to us follow the advice below. We will continue to keep you up to date with any changes.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Support for the farming community</h3>

<p>We work in partnership with Farming Help organisations to support their work to help the farming community through challenging times. If this affects you, please either contact them on 03000 111 999, visit their <a href="https://www.farminghelp.co.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Farming Help</a> website  or call us on 03000 200 301.</p>
</div>

<h3>Farm visits and inspections</h3>
<p>Following government guidance, our inspectors will continue with most inspection work to ensure that we meet our regulatory targets and do not cause any delay to payments.</p>

<p>They will continue to follow our strict COVID-19 secure health and safety procedures (including social distancing and other approaches to reduce face to face contact) that we put in place last year and will carry out risk assessments before each inspection.</p>

<p>We will contact customers before a visit to explain the arrangements and to find out if there are any issues we need to be aware of, including vulnerability.</p>

<p>Further advice and guidance is also available from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/operational-update-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Natural England</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/forestry-commission-operational-update-covid-19">Forestry Commission</a>.</p>

<h3>How to submit your applications, claims, evidence and other supporting documents</h3>
<p>See at a glance the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rural-payments-ways-to-submit-applications-claims-and-documents" class="govuk-link">different ways to submit applications, claims and documents</a> to us.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk">Rural Payments service</a> is available and you should use this wherever possible.</p>

<p>It’s the quickest and most secure way for you to send your applications, claims and supporting documents to us, and it will help us to start processing your application or claim as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Where there is no option to use the Rural Payments service or you are unable to access the online service, you currently have 2 options.</p>

<h4>Option 1: use email</h4>

<p>You can email us at <a href="mailto:ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk</a> where the guidance confirms there is an existing email service. We recommend you use this.</p>

<p>When you email us make sure you include the name of the scheme in the subject heading, for example 
  ‘Countryside Stewardship Mid Tier query’. This will help your email get to the right department quickly.</p>

<p>Read more information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/emailing-documents-to-the-rural-payments-agency-rpa" class="govuk-link">emailing documents to RPA</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Remember, we can only accept emails from email addresses that are registered in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>It’s important (especially in these challenging times) that we have your most up-to-date personal and business 
  contact details. We may contact you by email or telephone, so check your details in the <a href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Rural Payments 
  service</a>, and update them or register if necessary.</p>

<p>Also, please make sure your permission levels for CS and BPS are set and are correct. You can find more 
  information about how to do this in our <a href="https://ruralpayments.blog.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">blog</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to regularly check your spam or junk email folder so you don’t miss important emails that we’ve 
  sent to you. And, read our <a href="#be-aware-of-fraud" class="govuk-link">Be aware of fraud</a> section as we are aware of coronavirus 
  (COVID-19) related scams.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We cannot accept supporting documents and evidence that we need to access from links to an external shared drive facility, for example Dropbox or Google Drive.</p>
</div>

<h4>Option 2: use post</h4>

<p>If there’s no existing email service and you would normally <a class="govuk-link" href="#postal-addresses">post</a> something to us, you 
  should continue to use the post.</p>

<p>However, we understand that the Royal Mail has indicated that it’s likely some areas of the country may experience some level of disruption due to coronavirus(COVID-19) related absences at local mail centres or 
  delivery offices. If you need to post documents to us, we would encourage you to do so as soon as you can.</p>

<p>If you’re unable to get online or post a paper application form, paper claim form, or supporting documents to us   before the application or claim deadlines, please call our helpline on 03000 200 301.</p>

<p>Where the person with the correct permissions is not able to sign any forms, due to coronavirus (COVID-19) 
  related issues, this can be done by someone else and a note advising us of this is clearly shown either on the front of the document or next to the signature box. We will verify the signature before making any payments to you.</p>

<p>We recommend that changes to permission levels are done before applications and claims close, where possible. In exceptional circumstances, if the signatory does not hold the correct permission level at the time they submit an application or claim, we will allow them to arrange this afterwards. This should be done as soon as possible to avoid a delay to payments.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please do not bring any documents to our offices (even if they are listed as accepting <a class="govuk-link" href="#postal-addresses">postal deliveries</a>). We’re unable to accept correspondence or documents in person.</p>
</div>

<h4>RLE1 form</h4>
<p>You can use the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">Rural Payments service</a> to transfer BPS entitlements to someone else, transfer land to someone else, and remove land from your holding. This is the quickest and best way to tell us about changes. Or you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-payments-add-land-by-email-for-2021">add land by email</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers" class="govuk-link">submit an RLE1 form</a> to us, you can now do this electronically, by email, to tell us about entitlement transfers, land transfers and land changes.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers" class="govuk-link">download an RLE1 form</a>, complete it electronically following the RLE1 guidance, and return it to us as a PDF email attachment.</p>

<p>If you are unable to get online or email it to us, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers" class="govuk-link">print an RLE1 form</a>, complete it by hand, and <a href="#postal-addresses" class="govuk-link">post</a> it to us.</p>

<h4>Organic certificates</h4>
<p>We understand that organic certification bodies are making arrangements to issue certification and conversion documents where they are unable to make site visits.</p>

<p>We will accept all such documents in whatever format the organic body issues them in, where it’s necessary to support CS applications, and CS and ES claims.</p>

<p>Please email a copy of any certificates to us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk">ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re unable to get online, you can <a href="#postal-addresses" class="govuk-link">post</a> a copy to us.</p>

<h2>Who we will contact</h2>
<p>We want to reach as many customers as possible during these challenging times. Therefore, we are sending reminders to more of our BPS and CS contacts we hold in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk">Rural Payment service</a> who have ‘submit’ or ‘full’ permissions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customers or their agents must hold ‘submit’ and ‘full’ business permissions</li>
  <li>An agent with ‘full’ business or ‘submit’ permissions supersedes a customer with ‘full’ or ‘submit’ business permissions</li>
  <li>If multiple agents have ‘submit’ or ‘full’ permissions, the agent with ‘full’ business permission supersedes those with ‘submit’</li>
  <li>If multiple agents have ‘full business’ permissions, they all receive any communications</li>
  <li>If there is no agent with ‘full’ business permission, but there are multiple agents with ‘submit’ permissions, they will all receive any communications</li>
  <li>All agents must have an email address registered in the Rural Payments service</li>
  <li>If no agents fit the above criteria, the same criteria will be used against the remaining people with permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to be certain that any correspondence or contact you receive from us is genuine as there are coronavirus (COVID-19) related scams from people claiming to be from other government departments. Please read the <a href="#be-aware-of-fraud" class="govuk-link">Be aware of fraud</a> section below, which will help you to protect yourself.</p>
