<h2>Contact the travel insurance company</h2>

<p>If the person who died had insurance, contact their insurance company as soon as possible. Insurance providers may help to cover the cost of repatriation. Repatriation is the process of bringing the body home. Insurance providers may also help with any medical, legal, interpretation and translation fees.</p>

<p>If the person who died had insurance, the insurance company will appoint a funeral director both locally and in the UK.</p>

<h2>What to do if the person who died didn’t have insurance</h2>

<p>If you are not sure whether the person who died had insurance, check with their bank, credit card company or employer.</p>

<p>If the person who died did not have insurance, a relative or a formally appointed representative will usually have to appoint a funeral director and be responsible for all costs. The FCDO provides a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk/list-of-uk-based-international-funeral-directors--2">list of UK-based international funeral directors</a>.</p>

<p>If you wish to arrange a funeral in Germany or repatriate the person who died to the UK, the FCDO provides a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/germany-list-of-funeral-directors/list-of-funeral-directors-in-germany">English-speaking funeral directors in Germany</a>.</p>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot help with any costs.</p>

<h2>Charities and organisations that offer support</h2>

<p>Some UK-based charities and organisations may be able to offer assistance, support and information to people affected by a death abroad. The FCDO provides a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad/death-abroad-uk-organisations-that-can-help">UK-based charities and organisations</a>.</p>

<h2>Register the death and obtain a death certificate</h2>

<p>Deaths must be registered in the country where the person died. In Germany a death is registered at the local registry office. A funeral director can usually do this for you. Registrars in Germany will require certain documents and pieces of information about the person who has died to register their death, which include their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>birth certificate, stating their place of birth and the names of their parents</li>
  <li>religion</li>
  <li>official identity document (for example their British passport)</li>
  <li>details of their spouse (if applicable)</li>
  <li>marriage certificate (if applicable)</li>
  <li>divorce papers (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>Registrars will normally issue the death certificate (Sterbeurkunde) in German. You can request an international version (Internationale Sterbeurkunde) which provides a multilingual translation. German death certificates do not give the cause of death.</p>

<p>Ask for extra copies of the death certificate where possible. You might need to officially inform other organisations of the death.</p>

<p>You do not need to register the death in the UK. The local death certificate can usually be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-death-certificate">register the death with the Overseas Registration Unit</a>. You can order a UK-style death certificate, known as a Consular Death Registration certificate. A record will be sent to the General Register Office within 12 months.</p>

<p>You need to tell the local authorities if the person who died suffered from an infectious condition, such as hepatitis or HIV, so they can take precautions against infection.</p>

<h2>Deal with a local post-mortem</h2>

<p>Post-mortems are normally performed when the cause of death is unknown, unnatural, sudden or violent. Post-mortems are carried out by forensic doctors appointed by the court. Cultural or religious sensitivities may not be taken into account. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot stop or interfere with the process.</p>

<p>During a post-mortem, small tissue samples and organs may be removed and retained for testing without the consent of the person’s family. You will not automatically be told if this happens.</p>

<p>If any organs are removed they will be returned before the body is released for burial. In exceptional circumstances, for example, if further investigation is deemed necessary, body parts may be retained without permission. If this happens, the next of kin will be informed.</p>

<p>Post-mortem reports are not usually made available to the next of kin. However an appointed lawyer can apply for a report from the Public Prosecutor.</p>

<h2>Bring the body home</h2>

<p>If the person who died had insurance, find out if their insurance provider can help cover the cost of repatriation. Repatriation is the process of bringing the body home. If so, they will make the necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>If the person who died is not covered by insurance, you may be required to appoint an international funeral director yourself.</p>

<p>Repatriation from Germany to the UK can either be by road or by air. You should ask your appointed funeral director about the options available to you.</p>

<h3>Find an international funeral director</h3>

<p>A relative or formally appointed representative must appoint a UK-based international funeral director for the person who died to be repatriated to the UK. The FCDO provides a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk/list-of-uk-based-international-funeral-directors--2">UK-based international funeral directors</a>.</p>

<p>Local funeral directors will work with UK-based international funeral directors to make sure all the necessary requirements are met both locally and in the UK. This includes providing documents such as a local civil registry death certificate, a certificate of embalming and a certificate giving permission to transfer the remains to the UK.</p>

<h2>Advice and financial assistance for repatriation</h2>

<p>For organisations and charities that may be able to offer assistance with repatriation, see information on LBT Global in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad/death-abroad-uk-organisations-that-can-help#specialist-support-and-advice">Coping with death abroad: specialist support and advice</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad/death-abroad-uk-organisations-that-can-help#repatriation-charities-in-northern-ireland-and-wales">repatriation charities in Northern Ireland and Wales</a>.</p>

<p>If you wish to arrange a post-mortem in the UK once the body has been repatriated, you can make a request to a UK coroner. The coroner will then decide if a post-mortem is needed. If you want the person who died to be cremated you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cremation-forms-and-guidance">apply for a certificate from the coroner (form ‘Cremation 6’</a>.</p>

<h2>Bring the ashes home</h2>

<p>If you choose local cremation, the regulations on the repatriation of ashes from Germany to the UK vary across each of the German federal states. You may not be able to send an urn by post or courier. Urns can be shipped by air freight, although this can be expensive. You should seek advice and discuss the options with your funeral director before making a decision.</p>

<p>If you can collect the ashes and plan to transport them by air, check with the airline about any specific restrictions or requirements. For example, check whether you can carry the ashes as hand luggage. The crematorium may request additional documentation before releasing the urn.</p>

<p>When leaving Germany with human ashes you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show the death certificate</li>
  <li>show the certificate of cremation</li>
  <li>fill in a standard customs form when you arrive home</li>
  <li>follow local German regulations about departing with human ashes</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not have the person cremated abroad if you want a UK coroner to conduct an inquest into their death. If you cannot transport the ashes yourself, a funeral director will be able to make the necessary arrangements. The FCDO provides a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk/list-of-uk-based-international-funeral-directors--2">list of UK-based international funeral directors</a>.</p>

<h2>Bury or cremate the body locally</h2>

<p>To have a local burial or cremation, a relative or a formally appointed representative needs to appoint a local funeral director.</p>

<p>The FCDO provides a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/germany-list-of-funeral-directors/list-of-funeral-directors-in-germany">English-speaking funeral directors in Germany</a>.</p>

<p>The funeral director will be able to explain the local process and options available to you.</p>

<p>Foreign nationals can be buried or cremated locally in Germany. However the local laws and procedures about when a funeral or cremation can take place vary across each of the federal states.</p>

<p>If a local burial or cremation takes place, there will not be a coroner’s inquest carried out in the UK.</p>

<h2>Retrieve belongings</h2>

<p>Personal belongings found on the person who died at the time of their death are handed to the police and/or local authority if the family is not present.</p>

<p>If the person who died was a resident in Germany, access to their belongings may be restricted, as these may be included in their estate. In this case, you should seek legal advice on how to proceed.</p>

<p>If you choose to repatriate, instruct the local funeral director to collect all personal belongings from the police or court and transport them together with the body.</p>

<p>If there is an investigation into the death, clothing may be retained as evidence and will not be returned until the court case is finished.</p>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot help with the cost of returning personal belongings to the family.</p>

<h2>Find a translator</h2>

<p>You may need a translator to help you understand the information or get certain documents translated. The FCDO provides a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/germany-list-of-translators-and-interpreters/list-of-translators-and-interpreters-in-germany--2">official translators in Germany</a>.</p>

<h2>Find a lawyer</h2>

<p>You can apply to appoint a lawyer in certain circumstances, such as a suspicious death. The FCDO provides a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers&amp;country=Germany" rel="external">English-speaking lawyers in Germany</a>.</p>

<h2>Cancel a passport</h2>

<p>To avoid identity fraud, the passport of the person who died should be cancelled with Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO). To do this, you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-with-a-passport-when-the-passport-holder-has-died">complete a D1 form</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to repatriate the person who died to the UK, you may require their passport to do this. In these circumstances, you should cancel the passport after they have been repatriated.</p>

<h2>Check you have done everything you need to do in the UK</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">Check this step-by-step guide for when someone dies</a> to make sure you have done everything you need to do in the UK. You can find information on how to tell the government about the death, UK pensions and benefits and dealing with the estate of the person who died.</p>
