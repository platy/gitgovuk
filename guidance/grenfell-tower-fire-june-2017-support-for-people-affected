<h2 id="home-office-grenfell-immigration-policy">Home Office Grenfell immigration policy</h2>

<h3 id="survivors-policy">Survivors’ policy</h3>

<p>The deadline for the Grenfell <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/grenfell-tower-fire-handling-immigration-cases">survivors’ immigration policy scheme</a> has now passed. However, if you were directly affected by the fire, then we want to help and support you. If you think you would have been eligible for the scheme and have a good reason for not coming forward before 31 January 2018, you can discuss your circumstances with us. We will not use this tragedy as a reason to conduct immigration checks on those who have been directly affected by the fire.</p>

<p>Make an appointment at the Curve Community Centre to discuss your circumstances, call 020 8196 4531 or use the drop-in service every Thursday 2pm to 6pm.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-have-been-granted-leave-under-the-survivors-policy">If you have been granted leave under the survivors’ policy</h3>

<p>You should have received a letter from the Home Office. The letter explains that you need to apply for a further 2 years’ limited leave to remain outside the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Immigration Rules</a> within a month of the existing leave expiring. You can use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-to-extend-stay-in-the-uk-flrgt">FLR(GT) application form</a>.</p>

<p>Any grant of further leave will be subject to your circumstances remaining the same and the usual security, criminality and fraud checks being met. Those granted leave will continue to have full access to public funds and rights to work in the UK.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for indefinite leave to remain in the UK after 5 years continuous lawful residence in the UK under this policy. Further information will be available on GOV.UK when people become eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain under this policy in 2022.</p>

<h3 id="relatives-policy">Relatives’ policy</h3>

<p>Relatives of those directly affected by the Grenfell Tower fire who have core participant status in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.grenfelltowerinquiry.org.uk/">Grenfell Public Inquiry</a>, may be able to extend their stay in the UK under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/grenfell-tower-handling-relatives-immigration-cases">Grenfell relatives’ policy</a>. You will not have to pay an application fee to extend your stay under the relatives’ policy. Relatives of those directly affected by the fire may also be able to extend their stay in line with the policy.</p>

<p>To extend your stay in the UK or request a change to conditions, make an appointment at the Curve Community Centre, call 020 8196 4531 or use the drop-in service every Thursday 2pm to 6pm.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-do-not-qualify">If you do not qualify</h3>
<p>You may be eligible to make an application under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Immigration Rules</a> if you wish to remain in the UK, for example under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa">family, private life and exception circumstances policy</a> on the <a rel="external" href="https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/family-routes">FLR(FP)</a> application form. You may also be eligible to apply for leave on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-to-extend-stay-in-the-uk-flrhro">FLR(HRO)</a> application form to remain in the UK under our existing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chapter-1-section-14-leave-outside-the-immigration-rules">leave outside the Rules policy</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not meet the requirements to be granted on another basis, you will be considered in with the Grenfell relatives’ policy on an exceptional basis.</p>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-asylum">apply for asylum</a> if you wish to remain in the UK as a refugee.</p>
