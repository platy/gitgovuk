<h2>Making a transit declaration</h2>

<p>A separate version of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-new-computerised-transit-system-supporting-guidance" class="govuk-link">New Computerised Transit System (<abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>)</a> has been created to enable you to start movements in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>This version is only used in Northern Ireland and will only accept departure and arrival declarations in respect of Transit offices located in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>It does not accept departure and arrival declarations for Transit offices located in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Great Britain</li>
  <li>the Crown Dependencies (Channel Islands and Isle of Man)</li>
</ul>

<p>The submission channel for Northern Ireland departure and arrival notifications is by software only.</p>

<p>You need to make sure that your software is able to interact with <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> using either email or XML.</p>

<p>You can still start and end movements in Great Britain using either the free to use web portal or a software package to interact with <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>. This includes goods that originate in Northern Ireland and are moved to Great Britain under unfettered access.</p>

<p>If your software is unable to interact with <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> using email or XML, you cannot use <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> to start or end transit movements in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>If you do not want to do this yourself, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appoint-someone-to-deal-with-customs-on-your-behalf">get someone to deal with customs for you</a>.</p>

<h2>Starting a common or Union transit movement in Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>You can start a transit movement in Northern Ireland from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the premises of an authorised consignor (your or an agent’s premises)</li>
  <li>an office of departure</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are starting your transit movement at the premises of an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-be-an-authorised-consignor-or-consignee">authorised consignor</a>, you can present your goods to your authorised consignor. They can start the movement and issue the Transit Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr>) and movement reference number (<abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr>).</p>

<h3>How to start your movement</h3>

<p>If you are starting your movement from an office of departure in Northern Ireland, you will need to request to start a transit movement by emailing Border Force at: <a href="mailto:BFPortteam@homeoffice.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">BFPortteam@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori">Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI)</a> number</li>
  <li>your local reference number (LRN) and either your:
    <ul>
      <li>movement reference number (<abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr>)</li>
      <li>export reference number (ERN) from your export documentation (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>method of transport</li>
  <li>the name of the port you will be departing from</li>
  <li>the location where your goods will be held in Northern Ireland until the transit movement has been started</li>
  <li>date and time of intended departure from Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any additional documents which you are using to support a simplified declaration procedure, then you should also attach copies of these documents.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You must email Border Force at least 12 hours before your goods are due to depart.</p>
</div>

<h3>If your goods require physical checks</h3>

<p>Most goods do not require a physical check, but if this is needed then Border Force will email you with instructions to take your goods to a specified location for inspection. Find a list of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit" class="govuk-link">community and common transit offices in Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Once your goods have been checked and cleared, Border Force will start the transit movement and issue you with a <abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr> and <abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr>.</p>

<h3>If your goods do not require physical checks</h3>

<p>Border Force will start the transit movement and issue the <abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr> and <abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr>. Your <abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr> will be available for printing from <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are not able to print your <abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr> from <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> then you will need to contact Border Force  to arrange an alternative method of collection.</p>

<h2>Ending a common or Union transit movement in Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>You can end a transit movement in Northern Ireland at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the premises of an authorised consignee (your or an agent’s premises)</li>
  <li>an office of destination</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are ending your movement at the premises of an authorised consignee, they will check your goods and end the transit movement on <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>How to end your movement</h3>

<p>If you end your movement at an office of destination in Northern Ireland, you will need to email Border Force requesting to end a transit movement at <a href="mailto:BFPortteam@homeoffice.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">BFPortteam@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>your Movement Reference Number (<abbr title="movement reference number">MRN</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the method of transport</li>
  <li>the name of the port you will be arriving into</li>
  <li>the location where your goods will be held on arrival in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>the estimated arrival date and time of arrival of your goods at your stated location</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to attach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr> (or C88 document)</li>
  <li>a confirmation of entry of the movement into another customs procedure, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>an entry into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/customs-handling-of-import-and-export-freight-chief-replacement-programme">Customs Declaration Service (CDS)</a> or CHIEF</li>
      <li>import declaration</li>
      <li>movement into temporary storage</li>
      <li>T2L documents</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must email Border Force with this information at least 12 hours before your goods arrive at their destination.</p>
</div>

<h3>If your goods do require physical checks</h3>

<p>Most goods will not require a physical check, but if this is needed then Border Force will email you with instructions to take your goods to a specified location for inspection. Find a list of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit">community and common transit offices in Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>You must then email Border Force to confirm that your goods have arrived at their destination.
Border Force will end the transit movement on <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> and release your guarantee.</p>

<h2>From 5 April 2021</h2>

<h3>Starting a transit movement at an office of departure</h3>

The office of departure will only start the movement, issue a <abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr> and movement reference number once you have done this.</p>

<p>You must also provide Border Force with notification of planned departures before you arrive at the office of departure by emailing: <a href="mailto:BFPortteam@homeoffice.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">BFPortteam@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to include:</p>

<p>You must also provide Border Force with notification of planned arrivals before you arrive at the office of destination by emailing: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:BFPortteam@homeoffice.gov.uk.">BFPortteam@homeoffice.gov.uk.</a>.</p>
