<p>Guidance for existing agreement holders about extensions for eligible Environmental Stewardship (<abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr>) <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreements due to expire in 2023.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement extensions</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2023, all <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreements will run under domestic terms and conditions. This means that the rules on extending your <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement are changing and you may be eligible to extend your <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement for 5 years.</p>

<p>Natural England will assess if you meet the criteria and, where appropriate, recommend that the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) offer you an extension to your agreement for 5 years.</p>

<p>The extension will run from the original end date of your agreement and will be based on the criteria that was used in previous years. You must continue to meet these criteria.</p>

<p>Within the 5-year extension, you can leave your agreement at an agreed point if you are accepted onto another environmental scheme.</p>

<p>If you’re a tenant and your tenancy agreement expiries within the 5-year extension, you should try to renew your tenancy agreement to cover the extension period.</p>

<p>If this is not possible, ask your landlord if they’re willing to take on the responsibility for the agreement once your tenancy expires.</p>

<p>Your landlord should countersign your agreement extension using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/countryside-stewardship-land-ownership-and-control-form">land ownership and control</a> form.</p>

<p>Contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> about a shorter extension period if neither option is possible.</p>

<div class="contact">
<p>Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk">ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Telephone: 03000 200 301<br>
Monday to Friday, 8.30am to 5pm. Find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/call-charges">call charges</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>circumstances change, contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>contact details have changed, you should amend them on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information about domestic terms and conditions will be published in Autumn 2022.</p>

<h2>When to respond to an expression of interest request</h2>

<p>If you have an <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement due to expire in 2023, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send you an expression of interest (<abbr title="Expression of interest">EOI</abbr>) request.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to decide if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>would like to extend your agreement</li>
  <li>do not want to continue your agreement beyond its end date</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not want to extend, let <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> know by replying to the <abbr title="Expression of interest">EOI</abbr> request.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in extending your agreement, you do not need to reply to the <abbr title="Expression of interest">EOI</abbr> request. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send you an extension offer before your agreement ends if you meet the criteria.</p>

<p>When you receive the extension offer, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will ask you to accept or decline the offer. You may need to send supporting documents if you want to extend your agreement. Take this opportunity to read this guidance to see if you meet the extension rules and arrange for any supporting documents that may be needed.</p>

<p>You should contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> by email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk">ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk</a> before the end of your current agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your agreement meets the eligibility criteria and you did not receive an offer to extend it</li>
  <li>you’ve not opted out of extending it</li>
  <li>you’ve opted out of extending it, but you’ve changed your mind</li>
</ul>

<h2>Criteria for an <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extension</h2>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will offer an extension to an <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement based on the current agreement meeting its expected environmental outcomes, and that you’re eligible to apply.</p>

<p>If you’re not offered an extension for your agreement, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will let you know in time for you to apply for a new scheme.</p>

<p>If your agreement has already been extended in previous years, the criteria below will still apply.</p>

<h3>Agreements eligible for an extension</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extension must meet these criteria.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement must not have expired or been terminated on or before the date you accept the extension, and <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> has received your acceptance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have requested the extension and agree to comply with its terms and conditions. Further information about domestic terms and conditions will be published in Autumn 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot claim for any further capital works during the extension to help you meet your agreed outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must have completed any outstanding land transfers before the start of the extension. You are responsible for completing all paperwork - including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">form RLE1</a> by that deadline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must have resolved any breach in your existing agreement before the start of the extension. You must have responded to all requests for information relating to the breach from Natural England or <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> and put right any issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have no unmanaged areas of sites of special scientific interest (<abbr title="sites of special scientific interest">SSSIs</abbr>) or scheduled monuments (<abbr title="scheduled monuments">SMs</abbr>) on your land that need new management.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Assessment of environmental benefits</h3>

<p>Natural England will assess your current agreement to make sure it’s eligible for an extension. The assessment is based on the options in your current agreement. Natural England will make its recommendation based on these benefits.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The options in your current <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement remain appropriate for the Environmental Stewardship (<abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr>) priority target features on your holding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the assessment, you are on track to meeting the required outcomes of your agreement based on the success indicators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If land within your agreement is an <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>, the current land management is still appropriate for that <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>. Natural England is able to give their consent, for operations that need their consent without amending the agreement, and without the need for additional capital works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your agreement has 80% or more of the priority habitats under management options. It’s unlikely Natural England will agree to extend your agreement if the percentage falls below 80%. You should consider applying for Countryside Stewardship <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mid-tier-and-wildlife-offers-manual-countryside-stewardship">Mid Tier</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/higher-tier-manual-countryside-stewardship">Higher Tier</a> to bring the unmanaged priority habitats into suitable options.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will only consider an extension for these agreements if there are genuine practical or administrative barriers, which would prevent the additional habitat from being managed under another scheme.</p>

<p>Extensions will not be available on holdings with unmanaged <abbr title="sites of special scientific interest">SSSIs</abbr> or <abbr title="scheduled monuments">SMs</abbr> that need to be under scheme options. In this situation, you can apply for a Countryside Stewardship agreement.</p>

<h2>Additional rules</h2>

<p>The following rules will also apply to <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extensions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot use an extension offer to add, remove, or replace options or land in the current agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will remove Permissive access options HN1-HN7 from the agreement before making the extension offer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You keep all educational access items.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will remove any incomplete capital works from the agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extensions are available for <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>, ELS/<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>, OELS/<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> and UELS/<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will not extend an agreement if there are no remaining <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> options available, for example after permissive access is removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to submit a new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-stewardship-supplementary-land-ownership-and-control">supplementary land ownership and control form</a>, with your acceptance declaration, that’s countersigned by your landlord if:<br>- there are any changes to management control under the landlord’s consent for 2023 agreement year<br>- your current arrangements expire during the extension period<br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to submit a new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-land-and-shared-grazing-form-countryside-stewardship">shared grazing and common land form</a> with your acceptance declaration if:<br>- there are any changes to the commons supplementary arrangements for the 2023 agreement year<br>- your current arrangements expire during the extension period</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Changes to boundary restoration options for extended agreements</h3>

<p>If you have any of the following options in your agreement, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send you an ELS base map with your revised extension agreement documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UB14, OB14, EB14, UOB14: Hedgerow restoration</li>
  <li>UB15: Stone-faced hedgebank restoration</li>
  <li>UB16: Earth bank restoration</li>
  <li>UB17, UOB17: Stone wall restoration</li>
</ul>

<p>You must mark up the length of boundary you will be restoring for the extension period on the map. This can be up to a maximum of 40 metres each year. You must keep the map for your records, as you may need to show it during a site visit. You cannot include lengths of boundary previously restored under the agreement. If you do not have any additional lengths of boundary to be restored, contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>How woodland will be affected by <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extensions</h3>

<p>If you have woodland options HC7 or HC8 in your current agreement with a combined area greater than 3 hectares (ha), <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will remove these options from your extended agreement. The woodland parcels will remain in your extended agreement without <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> payments (ELS payments will continue, if applicable).</p>

<p>If the HC7 or HC8 individual land parcels are larger than 0.5ha, but together are 3ha or less, then the HC7 or HC8 can remain in the agreement.</p>

<p>Any HC7 or HC8 options on parcels less than 0.5ha will be extended regardless of the total area of HC7 or HC8 on the agreement and do not count towards the 3ha limit.</p>

<p>However, if you wish to secure funding for ongoing management of these woodland parcels where HC7 or HC8 have been removed from the agreement, you will need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To apply for CS Woodland Higher Tier, you need a Forestry Commission (<abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr>) approved Woodland Management Plan (<abbr title="Woodland Management Plan">WMP</abbr>). You can apply for CS funding to prepare the plan through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/create-a-woodland-management-plan">Woodland Management Plan grant</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Request the removal of those parcels from your extended <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement by contacting <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> after <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr> have approved your <abbr title="Woodland Management Plan">WMP</abbr> or given approval in principle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apply for a standalone Higher Tier Woodland Only agreement. If you do not already have a plan approved by <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr>, you need to allow for the time it takes to write a <abbr title="Woodland Management Plan">WMP</abbr> and get it approved. Allow at least 7 weeks for <abbr title="Forestry Commission">FC</abbr> to approve your plan in support of your Higher Tier application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your draft plan no later than 31 December to allow enough time to get it approved and make a Higher Tier application. You should also allow for time to apply and receive any <abbr title="Woodland Management Plan">WMP</abbr> agreement if you are applying for funding.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Woodland Creation grant options HC9 and HC10 will be extended.</p>

<h3>Land with <abbr title="sites of special scientific interest">SSSIs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you are offered an <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> extension and you have a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> on your land, you will need a new consent for the ongoing management activities on the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>. You will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">get consent from Natural England</a> as soon as you receive the agreement extension documents from <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> cannot extend your agreement without the appropriate consent from Natural England, where this is required.</p>

<h3>Educational access options</h3>

<p>Educational access options will be extended. You will need to continue to record and submit a record of these visits, as currently required under the terms of your agreement.</p>

<h3>Greening and Ecological Focus Areas (<abbr title="Ecological Focus Areas">EFAs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Greening requirements were removed from the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>). This means that you do not need to consider the overlap of <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> options with <abbr title="Ecological Focus Areas">EFAs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>When a site visit is needed</h2>

<p>Natural England will carry out an initial assessment to see if your agreement may be suitable for extension before it is due to expire. If it is, a Natural England adviser will contact you to decide if your agreement still meets the rules and continues to provide the environmental outcomes it was set up to deliver.</p>

<p>The adviser may arrange a site visit to confirm your agreement is suitable. A site visit may not be necessary if Natural England already has sufficient knowledge of your agreement. If your agreement includes <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> land, a visit will take place.</p>

<h2>How to accept an agreement extension offer</h2>

<p>If your current agreement meets the criteria, a Natural England adviser will recommend that <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> offer an extension to your agreement for 5 years. We expect Natural England to complete assessments and make recommendations by December 2022.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will decide whether to extend your agreement and if suitable, will prepare an amended version of your agreement. To extend your agreement, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will remove any incomplete capital works and any options ineligible for extension.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send you an extension offer with amended agreement documents, and a declaration for you to sign if you want to accept the extension.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will offer you an extension to your agreement for 5 years if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your current agreement is due to expire in 2023</li>
  <li>you continue to meet the criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>You should contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> if there have been any changes to your circumstances. Also, consider whether any changes to your circumstances affect any consents you currently have, for example, <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent.</p>

<p>You will need to sign and return the declaration, and <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> must receive it by the date shown on the covering letter (usually 20 working days). You must send your declaration to the address in your offer letter. Emailed declarations will not be accepted.</p>

<p>You must also include any other consents and documents, if required, with the signed acceptance declaration. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent</li>
  <li>form: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-land-and-shared-grazing-form-countryside-stewardship">shared grazing and common land</a>
</li>
  <li>form: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-stewardship-supplementary-land-ownership-and-control">supplementary land ownership and control</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will record the receipt of your signed declaration and your <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement will continue until the new end date. You will need to submit an annual claim in the normal way. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will let you know when the claim form deadline is announced.</p>

<h2>If you disagree with <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>’s decision</h2>

<p>If you’re unhappy with a decision or service you’ve had from <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, follow its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to raise any query as soon as possible because it may not be possible to extend your agreement after the end date of your <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement, regardless of the final decision.</p>
