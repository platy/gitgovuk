<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>If you’re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average you may be able to get New Style Jobseeker’s Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr>).</p>

<p>New Style <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or at the same time as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit">Universal Credit</a>.</p>

<p>New Style <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> is a contribution based benefit. Normally, this means you may be able to get it if you’ve paid  enough National Insurance (<abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>) contributions, usually in the 2 full tax years before the year you’re claiming in. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-credits">National Insurance credits</a> can also count.</p>

<p>If you qualify, you can get New Style <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> for up to 182 days. After this your work coach will talk to you about your options.</p>

<p>If you qualify for both New Style <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> and Universal Credit, any New Style <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> you receive will be taken into account as income for Universal Credit.</p>

<h2>Why should I claim New Style <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr>?</h2>

<p>Your savings and capital (or your partner’s savings, capital and income) are not taken into account when claiming New Style <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr>. However, your earnings and any payment you’re getting from a pension can affect the amount you may receive.</p>

<p>While you receive New Style <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> you’ll be awarded Class 1 National Insurance credits, which can help towards your State Pension and other contributory benefits in the future. It is a regular fortnightly payment.</p>

<p>The following table shows what you may be able to claim depending on your circumstances:</p>

<h3>Support at your interview</h3>

<p>You can take someone with you to your <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> interview.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-your-nearest-jobcentre.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Contact your Jobcentre Plus</a> before the interview if you need support because of a disability or health condition (for example, if you’re deaf and need a sign language interpreter).</p>

<h3>Sign an agreement to look for work (‘Claimant Commitment’)</h3>

<p>At your&nbsp;<abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr>&nbsp;interview, you must sign an agreement about what steps you’ll take to look for a job. This is called a ‘Claimant Commitment’.</p>

<p>You and your work coach will agree what goes in your Claimant Commitment. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what you need to do to look for work - for example registering with recruitment agencies, writing a CV</li>
  <li>how many hours you need to spend looking for work each week</li>
</ul>

<p>What you agree to do will depend on things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your health</li>
  <li>your responsibilities at home</li>
  <li>how much help you need to get work or increase your income</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance/your-jsa-claim">Your&nbsp;JSA&nbsp;might be reduced or stopped</a>&nbsp;if you do not do what you’ve agreed to in your Claimant Commitment and you cannot give a good reason.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you disagree with a decision</h2>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/mandatory-reconsideration">challenge a decision</a> about your claim. This is called asking for mandatory reconsideration.</p>
