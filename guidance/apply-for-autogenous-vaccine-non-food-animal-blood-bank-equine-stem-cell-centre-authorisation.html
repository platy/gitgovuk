<p>Guidance on how to get an Autogenous Vaccine Authorisation (AVA), Non-Food Animal Blood Bank Authorisation (NFABBA), or Equine Stem Cell Centre Authorisation (ESCCA) - collectively known as Specific Manufacturing Authorisations.</p>

<h2>Autogenous Vaccines</h2>

<p>The manufacturing premises and the method of production must be the subject of a valid AVA for autogenous vaccines manufactured from pathogens or antigens obtained from an animal/s and used for the treatment of that animal and/or other animals within the same epidemiological unit or in the same rearing chain.</p>

<p>An AVA will only be granted if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the product has been inactivated. It is expected that most authorisations will relate to the manufacture of bacterial vaccines. Additional safeguards will be required in respect of most viral vaccines</li>
  <li>the VMD is satisfied that the production process will produce a consistent, safe product</li>
  <li>the premises are under the supervision of a person who has sufficient qualifications and experience to manufacture the product safely</li>
  <li>a veterinary surgeon has confirmed a need and fully justified the use of the AVA in preference to UK authorised products</li>
</ul>

<p>Manufacturers of autogenous vaccines may apply for two different types of authorisation; AVA-I (Individual), or AVA-S (Standard).</p>

<p>An AVA-I covers the production of a single batch of product; an AVA-S covers the on-going production of the products specified in the authorisation.</p>

<h3>Viral Autogenous Vaccines</h3>
<p>In the case of viral autogenous vaccines there is a need for a technical framework to give assurance that the associated risks are suitably controlled and that the final vaccines are free from contamination.</p>

<p>The requirements for the authorisation of these types of vaccines are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A Manufacturing standard such as a full GMP certificate or inspection from a VMD inspector. Where a viral vaccine is being produced at a GMP compliant site within the EU, the VMD retains the right to address specific manufacturing issues with the national competent authority and if necessary to carry out a site inspection. This is because production is not conducted to a harmonised set of requirements such as extraneous agent testing and validation of inactivation kinetics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assurance that the vaccine is an autogenous vaccine, ie. the vaccine is manufactured from pathogens or antigens obtained from an animal/s and used for the treatment of that animal and/or other animals within the same epidemiological unit or in the same rearing chain. The nature of the animal production industry where the vaccine is intended to be used should be taken into account. The use of the same isolate to produce further batches of vaccine would be on a quality risk basis and tested to determine similarity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete testing of cell seed to Pharmacopoeia European requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inactivation kinetics validation. This must cover the agent in the vaccine but also all possible sources of contamination from the isolate itself as well as potential sources of cross contamination. A risk assessment approach to those viruses which are not likely to be present can be conducted taking into account the geographical source of the isolate, the health status of the animals from which the isolate originated, other isolates handled in the plant and the range of extraneous agents testing of starting materials. A condition of authorisation would include the obligation to update this assessment and validation as appropriate, when any new isolates/starting materials are handled at the plant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extraneous testing of the final product to Pharmacopoeia European requirements where not justified by inactivation kinetics. It may be possible to have derogations on the degree of testing depending on the range of agents covered by the inactivation kinetics validation package and the risk assessment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Batch safety test using a double dose of vaccine to be conducted on the site of use of the vaccine with satisfactory results before use of the vaccine batch in the entire group of animals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pharmacovigilance reporting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Validation of any tests used for extraneous agents testing should be provided.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Blood Banks (NFABBA)</h2>

<p>An NFABBA authorises a blood bank for the collection and storage of blood for supply to a vet for the treatment of non-food producing animals. NFABBA applications can be made <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-autogenous-vaccine-non-food-animal-blood-bank-equine-stem-cell-centre-authorisation">online</a>.</p>

<p>Collected blood may be stored and supplied as whole blood or blood constituents.</p>

<p>The NFABBA permits the blood or blood constituents to be placed onto the market without the need for a marketing authorisation (MA) as long as no medicinal claims are made.  However, blood constituents must be obtained by the physical separation of donor blood into different fractions within a closed-bag system to be acceptable under this scheme.  The production of blood products by any other means should only be carried out by the holder of a manufacturing authorisation (ManA) and in accordance with an MA.</p>

<p>An NFABBA will only be granted if the VMD is satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the welfare of the animals used in the collection of blood will be respected</li>
  <li>the production process will produce a consistent, safe product</li>
  <li>the blood bank is under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon, or a person that is suitably qualified to operate the blood bank</li>
</ul>

<p>NFABBA holders must be established in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The NFABBA holder is also subject to a number of additional obligations.  These relate to the supply and administration of blood and blood constituents from the blood bank, the labelling of containers holding blood, and record-keeping. The requirements for each are outlined in the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013 (VMR). This guidance sets out additional requirements on reporting of adverse reactions.</p>

<h2>Stem Cells (ESCCA)</h2>

<p>An ESCCA authorises premises in the UK used for the collection, storage, processing, production and administration of equine stem cells for use as an autologous treatment for non-food producing horses.</p>

<p>It covers manufacturers that operate a cryo-storage facility, or bank of equine derived stem cells, or manufacture stem cells derived products.</p>

<p>An ESCCA will only be granted if the VMD is satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the welfare of the animals used in the collection of equine stem cells will be respected</li>
  <li>the production process will produce a consistent, safe product</li>
  <li>the centre is under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon, or a person that is suitably qualified to operate the centre</li>
</ul>

<h2>Validity</h2>

<p>With the exception of an AVA-I, an authorisation will be valid continuously subject to satisfactory re-inspection of the premises.</p>

<p>The frequency of the inspections will be risk-based and derived from the performance of the authorisation holder at the last inspection.</p>

<h3>AVA-I</h3>
<p>An AVA-I will be valid for one year from the date it was granted.</p>

<p>The single batch of vaccine covered by the AVA-I must be manufactured and placed on the market before the expiry of the authorisation.</p>

<h2>Variations</h2>

<p>You must submit a variation application to the VMD if you intend to make any changes to an authorisation that could impact upon the quality, safety or efficacy of the products manufactured, for example registered personnel changes, premises alterations, change of site.</p>

<p>An AVA-I may not be varied. The holder of an AVA-I will be required to submit an application for a new authorisation if any of the details change.</p>

<h2>Post Authorisation steps</h2>

<p>Your authorisation may be varied, refused, suspended or revoked if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have not complied with the Veterinary Medicines Regulations (VMR)</li>
  <li>you have manufactured a Veterinary Medicinal Product (VMP) which is not covered by the authorisation</li>
  <li>you have produced a VMP outside the terms of the authorisation</li>
  <li>the premises or equipment are no longer suitable</li>
</ul>

<p>Where it appears to the VMD that animal or public safety is at risk it may suspend an authorisation with immediate effect for a period of up to three months. This suspension may be renewed for further periods of up to three months if the VMD considers this necessary.</p>

<p>Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:postmaster@vmd.gov.uk">postmaster@vmd.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Obligations on holders</h2>

<h3>AVAs</h3>

<p>You are subject to a number of obligations in relation to the labelling of containers of autogenous vaccines, recordkeeping, and the reporting of adverse reactions. The requirements for each are outlined in the VMR.</p>

<p>Autogenous vaccines may not be released onto the market before a target animal safety test has been conducted on the premises on which it is intended to administer the vaccine.</p>

<p>Holders of an AVA-S are subject to batch release requirements. The VMD must be notified every time a batch of autogenous vaccine has been placed onto the market. It should be noted that a product may not be placed onto the market until a satisfactory on-farm safety test result has been achieved.</p>

<h3>NFABBAs</h3>

<h2>Blood collection from donor animals</h2>

<p>In setting up a blood bank the VMD expects that the animals used as donors will be client owned pet animals, rescue animals waiting for re-homing, or camelids from the same herd as recipients. It is also expected that the blood donation procedure will not require animal sedation / chemical restraint.</p>

<p>If the donor animals are a colony of animals kept for the specific purpose of blood donation then an application for a Home Office Licence under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (ASPA) 1986 and an NFABBA from the VMD will be required.</p>

<p>Donor animals should be free from certain infectious agents that may pose a potential risk to transfusion recipients. A risk assessment should be conducted to determine any necessary testing. Donor animals should be tested for those infectious agents whose presence cannot be excluded during the risk assessment in order to ensure that the risk of disease transmission from donors to transfusion recipients is minimised.  Retesting of repeat donors may be necessary and should be performed at suitable intervals based on the risk assessment.</p>

<p>An NFABBA holder must ensure that the health and welfare of the donor animals is not compromised.  At the time of donation, the attending vet must certify that each donor animal is suitable for use in the collection of blood.</p>

<h2>Supply and administration of blood from a blood bank</h2>

<p>The NFABBA holder may only supply blood or blood constituents from the blood bank to a vet.  These blood products may only be administered by a vet or someone acting under a vet’s responsibility.  In addition, the following rules must be followed in relation to the use of blood:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No person may administer blood to a food-producing animal;</li>
  <li>Any unused collected blood product should be disposed of as waste material</li>
</ul>

<p>The RCVS have reviewed this VMD guidance that includes criteria for suitable blood donors, additional species-specific criteria, and guidance concerning blood donation procedures.  At the time of publication, the RCVS considers these blood donation procedures and criteria to be consistent with recognised veterinary practice.</p>

<p>This VMD guidance for blood banks was the subject of tripartite discussion between the RCVS, VMD, and Home Office and was agreed by all three regulators.</p>

<h3>ESCCAs</h3>

<p>You are subject to a number of obligations in relation to the supply and administration of stem cells, labelling of containers of stem cell products, record-keeping, and the reporting of adverse reactions. The requirements for each are outlined in the VMR.</p>

<p>You should ensure that the health and welfare of the horses is respected at all times.</p>

<h2>Criteria for suitable blood donors under NFABBA scheme</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Identification: All donors should be uniquely identified, and records kept of all donations to ensure that donors that present problems at donations can be identified and excluded from further donations where appropriate.</li>
  <li>Travel: Donor cats and dogs must have no history of travel outside the UK and Ireland.  In the case of camelids, the travel history should be documented.  Any camelid imported from outside of the UK and Ireland within the preceding 12 months should not be used as a donor.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Medical history: The examining vet must consider the donor’s available medical history before allowing the donation to proceed.  Blood should only be collected from animals with:</p>

    <p>a. no history of receiving a blood transfusion</p>

    <p>b. no history of medical conditions (and not currently receiving medication)</p>

    <p>c. no history of taking any medication that could have a detrimental effect on the subsequent recipients of blood products from this donor, and</p>

    <p>d.  no history of having had any surgical procedures that could impact on the safe collection of blood from the donor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Temperament: A careful evaluation of donor temperament is important when selecting potential donor animals, especially donor cats.  Only animals that do not appear stressed, are compliant and settled, and can be handled without excessive restraint will be able to donate.  Donors must not be chemically restrained/sedated to facilitate collection of blood under the NFABBA scheme.</li>
  <li>Health status: The donor should be examined by a vet prior to blood collection to ensure it is in a good state of general health and therefore able to donate. This health assessment must take into consideration the donor animal’s species, breed, activity level, and haematological status before allowing the donation to proceed.</li>
  <li>Haematological status: The donor’s haematological status should be assessed to establish its suitability for donation (for example a measurement of packed cell volume and/or haemoglobin levels).  It must be determined that the relevant haematological parameters are within the acceptance ranges pre defined in the company’s approved procedures. Assessment of haematological status must also include checks to ensure that the planned volume of blood for donation can be removed safely without adverse effects, for example, induction of anaemia.</li>
  <li>Vaccination: Consideration should be given to any recent vaccinations received by the donor and whether this affects their ability to donate.</li>
  <li>Pregnancy and lactation: Animals that are pregnant or nursing are not permitted to be blood donors.</li>
  <li>Bodyweight: At the initial donation, the minimum bodyweight permitted is dependent on species as follows: 5 kg in cats, 25 kg in dogs, and 50 kg in camelids. At subsequent donations, blood may be collected from a donor animal weighing not more than 5% less than the bodyweight recorded at the initial donation.</li>
  <li>Age: Donor animals should be skeletally mature adults (fully grown). Geriatric animals should not be used. For example, eligible donor dogs should not be more than 8 years old and eligible donor cats should not be more than 9 years old.</li>
  <li>Repeat donors: In the case of repeat donors, the vet is responsible for ensuring no changes have taken place since the last donation that could have a detrimental effect on the donor or subsequent recipient.</li>
  <li>Interval between donations: The minimum interval between donations should be at least 8 weeks. Furthermore, the number of donations within a calendar year should be restricted to a level that would ensure there is no risk of significantly depleting the donor’s iron reserves. This could be supported by the re evaluation of relevant haematological parameters before donation to confirm that they have returned to within their normal range.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional criteria for cats</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Cardiac assessment: Donor cats should have no heart murmur on auscultation when assessed pre donation.  Prior to the first donation, and once annually thereafter, a heart scan (echocardiogram) should be performed to confirm the cat’s cardiac health status.</li>
  <li>Blood pressure: Before collecting blood, the attending vet should assess the donor cat’s blood pressure, and this should fall within normal reference ranges.</li>
  <li>Routine flea and worm treatments: When assessing the history of the donor, consideration should be given to as to whether appropriate levels of worming and flea treatment have been performed.</li>
  <li>Maximum donation volume: The maximum amount of blood that can be collected from a donor cat is 10% total blood volume (equivalent to approximately 6.6 ml blood per kilogram bodyweight), up to an absolute maximum volume of 60 ml of blood.  When calculating the maximum volume in overweight cats, the animal’s lean bodyweight should be used.</li>

<p>For example, a cat with a bodyweight of 5.0 kg at the initial donation will be able to donate a maximum of 33 ml of blood (that is 5.0 kg x 6.6 ml = 33 ml).</p>

<h3>Additional criteria for Dogs</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Maximum donation volume: 450 ml +/-10%.<br>
The donor dog must have a minimum bodyweight of 25 kg at the initial donation.  This will allow the collection of a volume of up to 450 ml +/-10%.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional criteria for New World Camelids (Alpaca, Vicuna, Llama and Guanaco)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Herd health status: Only donors that are in a good state of health should be used to donate.  Herd health information including known disease status (absence of certain infectious agents) should be reviewed.</li>
  <li>Maximum donation volume: 450 ml +/-10%. The donor must weigh a minimum weight of 50 kg at the initial donation. This will allow the collection of a volume of up to 450 ml +/-10%.</li>
  <li>Supply and administration of camelid blood: Blood collected from camelids, including blood constituents, should only be used within the herd where the donating camelid resides.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Blood donation procedures</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Blood collection should take place under the supervision of a vet, in premises including but not limited to a veterinary practice, farm or specifically adapted vehicle.  The location should provide the appropriate standard of hygiene for the procedures being performed.  The appropriate emergency backup must be available should it be required.</li>
  <li>All donations should adhere to the strict procedures detailed in the company’s approved procedures and be conducted with the owner’s informed consent.</li>
  <li>Owners should be permitted to be present throughout the donation process.  Measures should be taken to prevent blood collection from being a negative experience for the donor animal.</li>
  <li>When calculating the volume of blood that can be collected from a donor animal the attending vet must take into consideration all relevant factors.  These factors must include the donor’s haematological status and the maximum donation volume set for the specific species (see the additional criteria set for cats, dogs, and New World camelids).</li>
  <li>The donor should be closely monitored during the donation process.  Measures should be taken to reduce risk of haematoma and infection as a consequence of blood donation.</li>
  <li>Donors should be clinically examined after donating and monitored for signs of adverse effects.  First time donors should remain under observation for at least 30 minutes post donation and repeat donors for no less than 15 minutes post donation.</li>
  <li>Post donation, instructions should be given to the owner.  This information must include the contact details of an emergency vet available in the event of a delayed adverse reaction.</li>
  <li>Donors must not be routinely administered replacement fluids by injection under the NFABBA scheme.  The need for this type of fluid replacement therapy must be determined by the attending vet and should be reserved for those animals experiencing adverse effects from blood collection.  Animals that had previously experienced adverse effects of this kind following blood collection must not be allowed to donate blood under the NFABBA scheme in the future.</li>
