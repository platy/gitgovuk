<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been extended until 30 April 2021.</p>

<p>Claims for furlough days in January 2021 must be made by 15 February 2021.</p>

<p>You can no longer submit claims for claim periods ending on or before 31 October 2020.</p>

<p>You can read <a rel="external" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/calculate-how-much-you-can-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">previous versions of this guidance on The National Archives</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance covers Job Retention Scheme claims for periods up to 30 April 2021.</p>

<p>If you’re using the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to claim for employees’ wages, the steps you’ll need to take are:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">Check if you can claim.</a></p>

</li>
</ol>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Before calculating how much you can claim, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">complete the steps before calculating your claim</a>.This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#deciding-the-length-of-your-claim-period" class="govuk-link">deciding the length of your claim period</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#usual-hours" class="govuk-link">working out your flexibly furloughed employee’s usual and furloughed hours</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>For the period 1 November 2020 to 30 April 2021 the government grant will cover the full 80% of wages. Employers will not be required to contribute or top-up for the hours not worked. You will still need to pay employer National Insurance contributions and employer pension contributions, you cannot claim for these.</p>

<p>You can choose to top up your employees’ wages above the minimum 80% furlough pay amount but you do not have to. Employees must not work or provide any services for the business during hours which they are recorded as being on furlough, even if they receive a top-up wage.</p>

<h2>Record keeping requirements</h2>

<p>You must keep a copy of all records for 6 years, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount claimed and claim period for each employee</li>
  <li>the claim reference number for your records</li>
  <li>your calculations in case HMRC need more information about your claim</li>
  <li>usual hours worked, including any calculations that were required, for employees you flexibly furloughed</li>
  <li>actual hours worked for employees you flexibly furloughed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use the calculator</h2>

<p>This calculator can be used to work out what you can claim. It can be used for most employees who are paid either regular or variable amounts each pay period (for example, weekly or monthly).</p>

<p>The calculator cannot be used if employees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>started a notice period or went back off a notice period in the same claim period on or after 1 December 2020</li>
  <li>have an annual pay period</li>
  <li>have been transferred under The Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment (TUPE)</li>
  <li>were not employed continuously before their furlough started</li>
  <li>returned from statutory leave such as maternity leave in the 3 months prior to the claim period, and the claim period is in July 2020 or earlier</li>
  <li>receive employer pension contributions outside of an auto-enrolment pension scheme</li>
  <li>ended furlough then began again during the same claim period</li>
  <li>were variably paid, and have been on more than one period of furlough where any part of any of the periods of furlough was in the 2019 to 2020 tax year</li>
  <li>have variable pay, started employment before 6 April 2020 and were not on their employer’s payroll on or before 19 March 2020</li>
  <li>started employment with their employer during a calendar period in the 2019 to 2020 tax year which corresponds with part or all of the period being claimed for</li>
  <li>are on fixed pay and have had a change in payment frequency, for example from monthly pay to weekly pay</li>
  <li>have variable pay, were not on their employer’s payroll on or before 19 March 2020 and have been on more than one period of furlough after 1 November 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are claiming for an employee who is flexibly furloughed, you will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#usual-hours">work out their usual hours</a> before you use the calculator.</p>

<p><a role="button" class="gem-c-button govuk-button govuk-button--start" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/job-retention-scheme-calculator/"> Calculate now <svg class="govuk-button__start-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="19" role="presentation" focusable="false" width="17.5" viewBox="0 0 33 40"><path fill="currentColor" d="M0 0h13l20 20-20 20H0l20-20z"></path></svg></a></p>

<p>If you cannot use this calculator, you’ll need to work out what you can claim manually using the calculation guidance or by seeking professional advice from an accountant or tax adviser.</p>

<p>We will continue to improve our online services on a frequent basis, including supporting more employment situations with this calculator.</p>

<p>It’s your responsibility to check that the amount you’re claiming for is correct.</p>

<h2>Work out the maximum wage amount</h2>

<p>The maximum wage amount is £2,500 a month, or £576.92 a week. This is the upper limit of the amount you can claim for your employee’s wages.</p>

<p>You will also need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/calculate-how-much-you-can-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#work-out-80-of-your-employees-usual-wage" class="govuk-link">work out 80% of your employee’s usual wage.</a></p>

<p>If the length of time you’re claiming for is not one or more weeks or one month, you’ll need to use the daily maximum wage amounts to work out the maximum amount for each employee.</p>

<p>To work out the maximum amount you can claim, multiply the daily maximum wage amount by the number of calendar days your employee is furloughed for in your claim.</p>

<p>If you’re claiming for multiple pay periods in one claim, you can calculate the total maximum using a mixture of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>daily maximum wage amount</li>
  <li>weekly maximum wage amount</li>
  <li>monthly maximum wage amount</li>
</ul>

<p>Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-examples-to-help-you-work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages/examples-of-how-to-work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages-national-insurance-contributions-and-pension-contributions#example1" class="govuk-link">example of working out the maximum wage amount for part of a pay period</a>.</p>

<h2>Work out 80% of your employee’s usual wage</h2>

<p>You will need to work out 80% of your employee’s usual wages to determine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how much you have to pay your employees for the time they are furloughed</li>
  <li>what you can claim under the scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the calculator to help you work out how much you can claim, though there are some cases where this may not be suitable – it is your responsibility to check that the amount you are claiming for is correct.</p>

<p>You will need to identify the number of furlough days in the period. A furlough day means every calendar day within a period where the employee was either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fully furloughed</li>
  <li>under a flexible furlough agreement with you</li>
</ul>

<p>The way you should work out 80% of your employee’s usual wages is different depending on the way they’re paid. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#include" class="govuk-link">You must check what you can include as wages first</a>.</p>

<p>Choose the calculation you think best fits the way your employee is paid, this might not be the same way that you have worked out their usual hours. For example, if you pay your employee a fixed regular salary, use the calculation for fixed pay amounts. HMRC will not decline or seek repayment of any grant based solely on the particular choice of pay calculation, as long as a reasonable choice is made.</p>

<p>Where a claim covers multiple pay periods, this calculation should be done for each and then added together.</p>

<p>If your employee received some statutory payments you should <a href="#statutory-payments" class="govuk-link">adjust your claim for this</a>.</p>

<h3>If your employee has fixed pay</h3>

<p>You will need to identify the reference period that you will use to work out your employee’s usual wages.</p>

<p>The reference period is the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020 for employees who either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>were on your payroll on 19 March 2020, that is you made a payment of earnings to them in the tax year 2019 to 2020 which was reported to HMRC on a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) Full Payment Submission (FPS) on or before 19 March 2020</li>
  <li>you made a valid Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme claim for in a claim period ending any time on or before 31 October 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>For all other employees, the reference period is the last pay period ending on or before 30 October 2020; this will only apply for periods starting after 1 November 2020.</p>

<h3>If your fixed pay employee has worked overtime</h3>

<p>If your fixed pay employee has worked enough overtime to have a significant effect on the amount you need to claim, you should calculate 80% of their usual wages using the method for <a class="govuk-link" href="#varied-pay">employees whose pay varies</a>. Examples of situations where overtime could have a significant effect on the claim amount include where the employee worked overtime:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the reference period</li>
  <li>in the corresponding calendar period to the pay period you are claiming for</li>
  <li>a lot, or often, in the tax year up to the reference period</li>
</ul>

<h3>Work out 80% of wages for employees on a fixed salary</h3>

<p>To work out 80% of your employee’s wage:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with the wages payable to your employee in their reference period - if you’re claiming for a full pay period, skip to step 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by the total number of days in the pay period you are calculating for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by the number of furlough days in the pay period (or partial pay period) you are claiming for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 80%.</p>
</li>

<h3>If your employee’s reference period is not a full pay period or the pay frequency has changed</h3>

<p>You will need to work out your employees usual wages and then calculate 80% if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your employee’s reference period is not a full pay period</li>
  <li>your employee’s pay frequency has changed between the reference period and the pay period you are calculating for</li>
</ul>

<p>To work out their usual wages and then calculate 80%:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with the wages payable to your employee in their reference period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by the number of days in that period (including non-working days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by the number of furlough days in the pay period (or partial pay period) you are claiming for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 80%.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>If your fixed-rate employee’s first pay period ends after 30 October 2020</h3>

<p>You can claim for fixed-rate employees whose first pay period ends after 30 October 2020, if HMRC received the details of their wages on a PAYE Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) Full Payment Submission (FPS) on or before 30 October 2020 and the other eligibility conditions are met.</p>

<p>To work out 80% of the employee’s usual wages:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with the amount of the employee’s wages that was included on your last PAYE Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) Full Payment Submission (FPS) submitted to and received by HMRC on or before 30 October 2020. You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#include" class="govuk-link">check what you can include as wages first</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by the number of days in the pay period that PAYE Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) Full Payment Submission (FPS) relates to (including non-working days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by the number of furlough days in the pay period (or partial pay period) you are claiming for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 80%.</p>
</li>

<h3>Employees with annual pay</h3>

<p>The reference salary for employees with annual pay (including company directors) is calculated the same way as for other employees. We expect that most employees with annual pay will be treated as fixed rate employees.</p>

<p>Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-examples-to-help-you-work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages/examples-of-how-to-work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages-national-insurance-contributions-and-pension-contributions#annual-march" class="govuk-link">examples of calculating 80% of wages for employees with annual pay</a>.</p>

<h3>Employees whose pay varies</h3>

<p>If your employee has variable pay, how you work out their usual wages depends on when they were on your payroll.</p>

<p>For employees who were on your payroll on 19 March 2020, that is you made a payment of earnings to them in the tax year 2019 to 2020 which was reported to HMRC on a Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) Full Payment Submission (FPS) on or before 19 March 2020 you should calculate 80% of the higher of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wages earned in the corresponding calendar period in a previous year</li>
  <li>average wages payable in the tax year 2019 to 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>This also applies to employees for whom you made a valid Job Retention Scheme claim in a claim period ending any time on or before 31 October 2020.</p>

<p>For all other employees you should calculate 80% of the average wages payable between 6 April 2020 (or, if later, the date the employment started) and the day before they were first furloughed on or after 1 November 2020.</p>

<p>If your employee has variable hours you will have completed a similar comparison to work out their usual hours but the outcome may be different.</p>

<h3>Calendar lookback method</h3>

<p>When you calculate 80% of the wages from the corresponding calendar period in a previous year, the period you look back to depends on the period you are claiming for:</p>

<p>If your employee did not work for you in the lookback period, you can only use the averaging method to calculate 80% of their wages.</p>

<p>To calculate 80% of the wages from the corresponding calendar period in a previous year:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with the <a href="#eighty-percent" class="govuk-link">amount they earned in the corresponding part of the lookback period</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by the total number of days in that pay period - including non-working days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by the number of furlough days in the pay period (or partial pay period) you are claiming for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 80%.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are claiming for an employee who is furloughed for the whole month of February 2021, you may wish to make an adjustment to the employee’s pay to reflect that February 2020 had 29 days. When you calculate 80% of the wages from the corresponding calendar period in February 2020, you may use the full amount earned in that month or 28/29ths of that amount to reflect the leap year. HMRC will not challenge either approach.</p>

<h3>Averaging method</h3>

<p>To work out 80% of the average monthly wages for tax year 2019 to 2020:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with the amount of wages that were payable to the employee in the tax year up to the day before they were first furloughed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide it by the number of days from the start of the tax year – including non-working days (up to the day before they were first furloughed, or 5 April 2020 – whichever is earlier).</p>

<h3>Work out your employee’s minimum furlough pay</h3>

<p>The minimum furlough pay is the lesser of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>80% of their usual wage</li>
  <li>the maximum wage amount</li>
</ul>

<p>If your employee is flexibly furloughed the minimum furlough pay depends on their working and furloughed hours.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with the lesser of 80% of their usual wages and the maximum wage amount</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by the employee’s furloughed hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by the employee’s usual hours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the minimum amount you must pay your employee for the time they are recorded as being on furlough. You can choose to pay more than this but you do not have to.</p>

<p>If any of the furlough hours are taken as paid holiday or annual leave, you need to top up the pay for these hours to the employee’s full contracted rate.</p>

<h3>Calculating the number of working and furloughed hours for an employee that is furloughed or flexibly furloughed for part of a claim period</h3>

<p>If your employee is only furloughed or flexibly furloughed for part of your claim period, when calculating the number of furloughed hours you can claim for make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only calculate the employee’s usual hours for the days covered by the furlough agreement</li>
  <li>do not include any working hours on days not covered by a furlough agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies even if your claim period includes days before or after the employee’s furlough agreement. For example, because you’re claiming for multiple employees and some of them are furloughed for a different period.</p>

<h3>Work out how much you can claim for your employee’s furlough pay</h3>

<p>For periods up to 30 April 2021 you can claim a grant for the full amount of the minimum furlough pay.</p>

<p>Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-examples-to-help-you-work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages/examples-of-how-to-work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages-national-insurance-contributions-and-pension-contributions#min-furlough-claim" class="govuk-link">example of how to work out how much of the minimum furlough pay you can claim for.</a></p>

<h3>If your employee was paid a statutory payment in the claim period</h3>

<p>You must subtract the amount which is paid to the employee for the claim period from the amount you claim under the scheme, if your employee is paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Statutory Maternity Pay</li>
  <li>Statutory Adoption Pay</li>
  <li>Statutory Paternity Pay</li>
  <li>Statutory Shared Parental Pay</li>
  <li>Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay</li>
</ul>

<p>Your employee cannot be furloughed while they receive statutory sick pay and your employee cannot receive statutory sick pay while they are furloughed.</p>

<h2>Employment Allowance</h2>

<p>You may be eligible to claim the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-employment-allowance" class="govuk-link">Employment Allowance</a>.</p>

<p>The rules for claiming the allowance are the same, even if you claimed a Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme grant for your Class 1 employer National Insurance contributions costs for a claim period ending on or before 31 July 2020. You were only able to claim for a grant towards your Class 1 employer National Insurance contributions for periods between 1 March and 31 July.</p>

<p>If you’re eligible you can use the Employment Allowance to pay less employer National Insurance contributions until the allowance runs out or until the end of the tax year, whichever comes first. The Employment Allowance cannot be manually spread over the tax year if it would otherwise be used up sooner.</p>

<p>When working out how much employer National Insurance contributions you could have claimed back from the scheme, you should have subtracted any Employment Allowance you used in that pay period.</p>

<p>If you claimed the allowance and you did not have to pay any employer National Insurance contributions in a pay period, you should not have claimed for any employer National Insurance contributions costs through the scheme.</p>

<p>If the amount of Employment Allowance you claimed did not cover the total employer National Insurance contributions due, the grant you could have claimed was the lower of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grant towards employer National Insurance contributions costs that you already calculated</li>
  <li>employer National Insurance contributions costs that you paid, or expect to pay, across your entire payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>Employment Allowance can be claimed at any point in the tax year you’re claiming for, or for 4 years afterwards. If you’ve claimed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the grant for employer National Insurance contributions for periods on or before July, you must ensure that you do not receive relief for the same employer National Insurance contributions costs twice.</p>

<p>July 2020 was the last month for which you could claim a Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme grant towards National Insurance Contributions. You should have reduced the National Insurance contributions element of your Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme claims to take account of the Employment Allowance. If you have claimed too much you should contact our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/employer-enquiries">employer helpline</a> and we’ll change the value of your Employment Allowance claim.</p>

<p>If you delay your Employment Allowance claim and have unused allowance available at the end of the tax year, you can use this to reduce other tax costs. If you received a grant for employer National Insurance contributions costs through the scheme, you cannot claim the Employment Allowance against those same contributions. You should not include any National Insurance contributions covered through the scheme when calculating your Employment Allowance entitlement. If you included these, you’d wrongly get relief for the same cost twice. Attempting to get relief for the same costs twice is fraudulent and may result in claims being investigated.</p>
