<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to the Czech Republic to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>The Czech Republic’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/immigration.aspx" rel="external">Czech Republic’s government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.
If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in the Czech Republic. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with the Czech Republic’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 180 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in the Czech Republic, so you know which ones to use when speaking to the Czech Republic’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>
<p>You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to the Czech Republic for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>meeting with recruitment and talent agencies</li>
  <li>acquisitions, such as due diligence prior to purchase, or pre-closing activities</li>
  <li>attending court as a witness</li>
  <li>attending a trade fair or seminar convention</li>
  <li>attending a board meeting</li>
  <li>attending a workshop</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference (unpaid)</li>
  <li>meeting a client, customer or colleague</li>
  <li>attending a meeting with a contractor or vendor (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>fact-finding visits</li>
  <li>touring a company facility</li>
  <li>negotiating deals or contracts</li>
  <li>team-building activities</li>
  <li>receiving classroom-based training for the same group or company</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border you may be asked to show you have health insurance that covers your stay.</p>

<h2>Check the Czech Republic’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>The following may not require a visa or permit in the Czech Republic if they’re for no more than 7 continuous days and up to 30 days in a calendar year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing services as part of an after-sales agreement by a non-Czech company</li>
  <li>supplying goods or services</li>
  <li>carrying out assembly work under a commercial contract</li>
  <li>carrying out warranty and repair work</li>
  <li>educational and academic work in a school</li>
  <li>scientific, research and development work in a public research institution, or other research organisation</li>
  <li>performing artist</li>
</ul>

<p>The following may not require a visa or permit in the Czech Republic for up to 90 days in a 180-day period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dependants of diplomatic mission workers</li>
  <li>spiritual workers of the Catholic Church, or other religious societies registered in the Czech Republic</li>
  <li>members of rescue units assisting with the consequences of accidents or natural disasters, or providing humanitarian aid under international agreements</li>
  <li>employees in international rail, road and sea traffic, if working on behalf of a UK employer</li>
  <li>accredited journalists</li>
  <li>military members or civilian personnel</li>
  <li>work that has particular interest to the Czech Republic, usually requiring permission from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior or Trade</li>
</ul>

<p>These are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you have an EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) permit from another country you can work in the Czech Republic without a visa and permit for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.</p>

<h3>Notify the labour office</h3>

<p>The Czech company will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mpsv.cz/documents/20142/129607/Informace-o-nastupu-do-zamestnani-k-vykonu-prace-v-CR.pdf/63453390-eff4-2b66-01d3-87fc193664da" rel="external">notify the regional branch of the labour office</a> in writing on your first day of work.</p>

<h3>Dependant work</h3>

<p>You must make sure any exempt activities could not be classed as employment (dependant work).</p>

<p>You need to make sure the relationship between the Czech and UK organsations (and, or you) is not an employment relationship.</p>

<p>The Czech company should check with the labour office if they’re not sure if an activity would be classed as dependant work.</p>

<p>Dependant work would always require a work permit.</p>

<p>All exemptions would be covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>an employment confirmation letter</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma and professional certificates</li>
  <li>an after-sales agreement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>
<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the Czech Republic’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/immigration.aspx" rel="external">immigration authorities</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>
<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with the Czech Republic’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/immigration.aspx" rel="external">immigration authorities</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>
<p>If you have a family they won’t be able to apply for dependant permits if you’re working in the Czech Republic for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver rules</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a long-term permit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mvcr.cz/mvcren/article/third-country-nationals-long-term-residence.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Nw%3d%3d" rel="external">family members can join you</a>.</p>

<h3>Short and long-term permits</h3>

<p>You need a <a class="govuk-link" href="#short-term">combined Schengen visa and short-term work permit</a> if you’re in the Czech Republic for up to 90 days in 180-day period because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transferring short-term from a UK-based company to a branch in the Czech Republic</li>
  <li>working for a company in the Czech Republic on a short fixed-term Czech contract</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to apply for a long-term work permit if you’re in the Czech Republic for more than 90 days because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring long term to a Czech branch, or providing long-term services to a client in the Czech Republic</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a Czech company on a long-term Czech contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#sports">working in professionals sports as an athlete or player</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed work or you’re a statutory representative</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research, other academic work and teaching</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#invest">investing in the Czech Republic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Long-term permits are valid for up to 2 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<h2>Short-term transfer to a branch in the Czech Republic, or working on a short-term Czech contract</h2>

<p>To qualify for the combined Schengen visa and work permit you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have the relevant professional skills and experience for the job</li>
  <li>keep your employment contract with your UK employer, if you’re transferring (on assignment)</li>
  <li>have a signed letter from your employer stating the exact terms of the assignment, if you’re transferring</li>
  <li>sign a short-term Czech employment contract (for up to 90 days) with the employer in the Czech Republic</li>
  <li>meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mpsv.cz/minimalni-mzda" rel="external">minimum monthly wage requirements</a>, if you’re on a Czech contract</li>
</ul>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You need to check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Czech Republic’s embassy or consulate</a> on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You or your employer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mpsv.cz/web/cz/-/zadost-cizince-o-povoleni-k-zamestnani-o-prodlouzeni-povoleni-zamestnani-na-uzemi-ceske-republiky" rel="external">applies for a work permit</a> from the local Czech labour office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mzv.cz/visaform" rel="external">apply for a Schengen visa</a> at the Czech embassy or consulate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You register at the local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.policie.cz/clanek/oddeleni-pobytovych-agend.aspx" rel="external">Foreign Police Inspectorate</a> within 3 business days of arriving in the Czech Republic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your employer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mpsv.cz/-/sdeleni-zamestnavatele-o-nastupu-cizince-s-pracovnim-opravnenim-do-zamestnani-o-vyslani-k-plneni-ukolu-vyplyvajicich-z-uzavrene-smlouvy-nebo-o-vnitrop" rel="external">provides the local labour office with written information about your work and entry into the country</a> no later than your first day of work.</p>
</li>
