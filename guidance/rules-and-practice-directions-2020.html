<h2>What are the Criminal Procedure Rules?</h2>

<p>The Criminal Procedure Rules are rules about criminal court procedure in magistratesâ€™ courts, the Crown Court, the Court of Appeal and, in extradition appeal cases, the High Court. Each Part of the Criminal Procedure Rules contains rules about parts of that procedure. On this page there are summaries of what each Part is about and links to the rules in each Part. In those rules there are notes that give more detail, including references to the Acts of Parliament and other legislation that applies.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/759/contents/made" rel="external">Criminal Procedure Rules</a> are published at legislation.gov.uk. There you can read and download the rules in HTML and pdf.</p>

<p>On this page, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>read the rules online and download them in MS Word.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>read and download the Criminal Practice Directions made by the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On the Criminal Procedure Rules forms page you can read and download the forms to use with the rules.</p>

<h2>Criminal court procedure</h2>

<p>When someone is accused of a crime, they may be sent a notice (called a â€˜summonsâ€™ or a â€˜requisitionâ€™) that tells them to go to court on the date in the notice, or tells them to fill in a form with the notice and send that form to the court. Sometimes the person is arrested, questioned, formally accused of the crime (â€˜chargedâ€™) and then taken to court, or given a date they must go to court.</p>

<p>In the Criminal Procedure Rules anyone accused of a crime is called a â€˜defendantâ€™. The authority responsible for prosecuting the case in court is called the â€˜prosecutorâ€™. In most cases that will be the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

<p>Almost all criminal cases start in a magistratesâ€™ court. At court, some cases will be dealt with completely at the first hearing, for example if the defendant pleads guilty to the crime. Serious cases may be sent for trial in the Crown Court. Some cases may be sent for sentence in the Crown Court even if the defendant is convicted of the crime in a magistratesâ€™ court.</p>

<p>In magistratesâ€™ courts usually there will be between one and three magistrates. They may be helped by a legal adviser.</p>

<p>In the Crown Court there will be one judge. Usually there will be a jury for a trial.</p>

<p>At the first court hearing many cases will be postponed (â€˜adjournedâ€™) to another date. If the defendant pleads not guilty to the crime the court will need to arrange a trial to receive evidence about what happened. At the first hearing the court will ask for information about the case, set a trial date and make court orders (â€˜directionsâ€™) about getting the case ready for trial.</p>

<p>At the trial, unless the defendant pleads guilty the court will hear evidence from prosecution witnesses and it may receive written evidence. The prosecution witnesses can be questioned by the defendant or by the defendantâ€™s lawyer. After the court has heard, or read, the prosecution evidence the defendant can give evidence and can ask witnesses to give evidence for the defence. It is up to the prosecution to prove that the defendant is guilty, not up to the defendant to prove the opposite.</p>

<p>After the court has heard, or read, all the evidence the magistrates, in a magistratesâ€™ court, or the jury, in the Crown Court, decide whether the prosecution has proved that the defendant is guilty. If it has, the magistrates, in a magistratesâ€™ court, or the judge, in the Crown Court, pass sentence on the defendant. A sentence can be an order to spend time in prison, or to pay money (a â€˜fineâ€™), or to carry out unpaid work, or to do, or not do, other things.</p>

<p>Criminal offences are divided into three types. The most serious have to be sent by the magistratesâ€™ court to the Crown Court for trial and sentence. Those are described as â€˜triable only on indictmentâ€™. The least serious offences are tried and sentenced in the magistratesâ€™ court. Those are described as â€˜summary offencesâ€™. With the third type of offence the magistratesâ€™ court has to decide whether to send the case to the Crown Court or to keep it in the magistratesâ€™ court. Those offences are described as â€˜triable either wayâ€™. In most cases of that third type the defendant can choose to be tried in the Crown Court even if the magistratesâ€™ court is willing to keep the case. The decision about which court will try an offence of that third type is called â€˜allocating for trialâ€™. This Part contains rules about how the magistratesâ€™ court must allocate cases and send cases to the Crown Court for trial.</p>

<p>Even if the magistratesâ€™ court keeps a case involving an offence that is â€˜triable either wayâ€™, sometimes the court can send the case to the Crown Court for sentence if the defendant is found guilty in the magistratesâ€™ court.</p>

<p><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/923962/crim-proc-rules-2020-part-10.doc">Part 10 The indictment</a> (<span class="type">MS Word Document</span>, <span class="file-size">113 KB</span>)</span></p>

<p>The indictment is a Crown Court document in which the prosecutor must explain formally what the defendant is accused of doing. It has to be prepared after the case is sent by the magistratesâ€™ court to the Crown Court for trial.
