<h2>Support available to the further education sector</h2>

<p>Government is committed to ensuring the further education sector is supported to achieve continuous improvement and improved outcomes for learners and that should be available to all colleges and designated institutions, regardless of where they are on their improvement journey. It can mean helping good providers to become great providers, encouraging our strongest providers to share their expertise more with others through peer leadership, and sometimes offering more intensive and targeted support where that is needed.</p>

<p>This page brings together  the existing support available from the FE Commissioner, the Department for Education (DfE) and our delivery partners. The summary of support provided here includes support that is available to any college or designated institution that seeks it, support that is in its early development and will be made more widely available to all over time, and some support that is available through application on a competitive basis.</p>

<p>All types of support can be discussed and considered through Annual Strategic Conversations, an important and ongoing connection to your local further education team at DfE, or at any time through informal discussions with the FE Commissioner and her team.</p>

<p>While this summary is focused on government-funded support, we do acknowledge the wide range of market-led support also available. The support here should be seen as complementary to that.</p>

<h2>Active Support available from the FE Commissioner</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Informal, supportive conversation with the FE Commissioner team</h3>

<p>Available to all colleges and designated institutions</p>
</div>

<p>Support from the FE Commissioner and her team is not limited just to colleges or designated institutions in intervention. The FE Commissioner and her team of deputies and advisers have a wealth of further education practitioner experience and are available to support continuous improvement at all stages.</p>

<p>Any college that would like to request an informal discussion with the FE Commissioner or her team to explore what further Active Support might be available may do so at any time. These conversations will be advisory in nature and would form a good starting point for any reflection on further support a college or designated institution might find helpful.</p>

<p>Informal, supportive conversations can be requested by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fe.commissioner@education.gov.uk">fe.commissioner@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Principals intervention support group: An informal network</h3>

<p>Available to principals of all colleges in intervention and post-intervention, monitoring and support (PIMS)</p>
</div>

<p>The â€˜Principals Intervention Support Groupâ€™ is a solutions focussed peer support group, available to the principals of all colleges in intervention and post-intervention, monitoring and support (PIMS). The group is chaired by a current CEO of a college in intervention and will meet on a monthly basis. The purpose of the support group is to discuss concerns, share experiences and to provide a connection to other principals in a similar position. The FE Commissioner and DfE will not be involved in the administration of this group and will not be present at the meetings, unless requested to attend by the group.</p>

<p>You can request further information on the network by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fec.operations@education.gov.uk">fec.operations@education.gov.uk</a> or by contacting your territorial team.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Tailored Active Support from the FE Commissioner team</h3>

<p>Available to all colleges and designated institutions</p>
</div>

<p>The FE Commissionerâ€™s team is developing a range of specialist Active Support, separate from intervention, available for all colleges and designated institutions which can be tailored to suit specific need and circumstances. This can include help to understand specific issues or challenges and to improve what is already working well. It is likely a college or designated institution would first request an informal, supportive conversation, as outlined above, as a precursor to requesting and agreeing any further package of tailored support.</p>

<p>A key element of tailored Active Support will be working closely with FE sector agencies and colleges, signposting, promoting, and sharing examples of effective practices that we have identified through our FE Commissioner team and Annual Strategic Conversations.</p>

<p>The FE Commissioner team can also support colleges in their decision making in respect of significant strategic changes. This could take the form of general advisory discussions with college leaders and/or governors but could also include the specific support products, such as structure and prospects appraisals and local provision reviews, described below.</p>

<p>This flexible approach to support also includes the opportunity to engage peer-led support, if needed, direct from either the National Leaders of Further Education or National Leaders of Governance (see below for more detail).</p>

<p>Tailored Active Support is available on request by contacting <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fe.commissioner@education.gov.uk">fe.commissioner@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>FE Commissioner-led diagnostic assessments</h3>

<p>Available to all colleges and designated institutions</p>
</div>

<p>A diagnostic assessment is a comprehensive review of a college, undertaken by practitioners from the FE Commissionerâ€™s team. Practitioners will use their expertise to consider the collegeâ€™s governance, financial, and quality plans and provide suggestions and recommendations, where appropriate, that would lead to improvement. It enables the FE Commissioner to support the collegeâ€™s or designated institutionâ€™s senior leadership team and the board in considering how further improvements might be achieved.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1006411/College_Oversight_revised_document_July_21.pdf" rel="external">Further information on diagnostic assessments</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>FE providers can contact the FE Commissioner to discuss whether a diagnostic assessment would be useful and to progress any formal request. This can be arranged by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fe.commissioner@education.gov.uk">fe.commissioner@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Active Support from National Leaders of Further Education</h3>

<p>Available to all colleges and designated institutions</p>
</div>

<p>National Leaders of Further Education (NLFE) are serving college senior leaders who have a strong track record of delivering improvement, both at their own colleges and in working with others. They provide peer-led mentoring and support to colleges.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-leaders-of-further-education-programme-current-national-leaders/national-leaders-of-further-education-programme-current-national-leaders">Further information and a list of current NLFEs</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Colleges seeking support from an NLFE should email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fec.operations@education.gov.uk">fec.operations@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Active Support from National Leaders of Governance for further education</h3>

<p>Available to all colleges and designated institutions</p>
</div>

<p>National Leaders of Governance (NLG) are experienced college governors and governance professionals with a strong record of supporting college improvement. They provide peer-led mentoring and improvement support to governing boards.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-leaders-of-governance-for-further-education-national-leaders/national-leaders-of-governance-for-further-education-current-national-leaders">Further information and a list of current NLGs</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Governing bodies seeking support from an NLG should email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fec.operations@education.gov.uk">fec.operations@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>FE Commissioner-led structure and prospects appraisals</h3>

<p>Available to all colleges and designated institutions</p>
</div>

<p>Structure and prospects appraisals (SPAs) are a framework which enable colleges considering options to restructure. The FE Commissioner team can provide support to do this in a clear, objective, and evidence-based way.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fe-commissioner-led-structure-and-prospects-appraisals-spa">Further information on SPAs</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>You can request a SPA or discuss whether it would be helpful by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fec.operations@education.gov.uk">fec.operations@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Curriculum Efficiency and Financial Sustainability Support (CEFSS)</h3>

<p>Available to all colleges and designated institutions</p>
</div>

<p>CEFSS is a tailored support package designed to flexibly meet the requirements of all types of colleges, rather than a â€˜one-size-fits-allâ€™. The aim of CEFSS is to make a positive difference to colleges that may require help with costed curriculum and financial planning, and to raise awareness of effective practice which they can use and could be shared within the sector. Any suggested actions given through the help and support are advisory and it is up to the individual college to decide whether to implement any of the advice through their senior leadership team and board of governors.</p>

<p>There will be a range of supporting documents, case studies of effective practice, and more detailed information available from autumn 2022.</p>

<p>CEFSS can be accessed throughout the year by a direct request from a college to a member of the FEC team or the DfE Territorial Team, or they can contact the FEC team to request more information on CEFSS by emailing&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FEC.OPERATIONS@education.gov.uk">FEC.OPERATIONS@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Local provision reviews</h3>

<p>Available to all colleges and designated institutions</p>
</div>

<p>FE Commissioner local provision reviews (LPRs) assess options for changing the provision or structure of multiple institutions in a local area. LPRs make recommendations on the best way of achieving long-term sustainable provision.</p>

<p>You can request further information on LPRs by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fec.operations@education.gov.uk">fec.operations@education.gov.uk</a> or by visiting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-oversight-support-and-intervention/college-oversight-support-and-intervention#fe-commissioner-local-provision-reviews">college oversight: support and intervention</a> page on GOV.UK.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Active Support for recruitment to senior leadership and board appointments</h3>

<p>Available to all colleges and designated institutions</p>
</div>

<p>Support is available to governing bodies in their recruitment and selection panels for CEO/principals, other senior posts, or Chair of Board appointments.</p>

<p>Where it might be helpful, a request can be made for a member of the FE Commissioner team or NLG to join a selection panel to support decision making.</p>

<p>Support can be requested by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fe.commissioner@education.gov.uk">fe.commissioner@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Support available from the Department for Education</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Strategic Development Fund</h3>

<p>National programme of grant funding open to local collaborations of FE providers, including general further education colleges, sixth form colleges and designated institutions in England, as well as independent training providers.</p>
</div>

<p>The Strategic Development Fund (SDF) is a national programme that supports a change in facilities and provision to meet skills priorities across a local area and improve the local skills system.</p>

<p>Applications to the SDF can incorporate proposals that address quality improvement challenges shared by FE providers, generate new resources and learning for wider use, and strengthen the self-improvement capacity of the FE sector.</p>

<p>Applications must align with the prescribed geographical boundaries for the SDF as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/skills-accelerator-apply-now">SDF application guidance</a>. The lead applicant for each area will be expected to have an Ofsted grade of good or outstanding.</p>

<p>Prior to the SDF, the college collaboration fund (CCF) ran from 2020 to 2022 and supported groups of FE colleges to deliver a range of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-collaboration-fund-ccf-projects">projects</a>. FE providers can continue to access and benefit from the CCF legacy of free to use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-collaboration-fund-ccf-projects/resources-college-collaboration-fund-ccf">resources</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-collaboration-fund-ccf-insight-report">learning</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Independent business reviews</h3>

<p>Suitable for FE colleges and lenders</p>
</div>

<p>Independent business reviews (IBR) are intended to establish clarity on a collegeâ€™s position and to provide a robust and independent assessment of the options for its future. They are a tool for colleges and their lenders and funders.</p>

<p>IBRs can be commissioned by colleges, lenders, or, in exceptional circumstances, the DfE.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-oversight-support-and-intervention/college-oversight-support-and-intervention">Further information on IBRs</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>
