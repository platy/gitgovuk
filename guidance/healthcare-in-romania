<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>
</div>

<p>This content was originally published on the NHS website.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-romania">Healthcare in Romania after Brexit</h2>
<p>You should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national living in Romania and do not have statutory or private health insurance from a Romanian provider.</p>

<p>There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Romania in place. For example, if you are a current S1 form holder, or a posted worker or student using a <a href="#ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</a> you will not be able to use these to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-live-in-romania">If you live in Romania</h3>
<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Romania</a>. You can find more information on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.mae.ro/en">Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>
</li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Romania. If you live in Romania, you must contribute to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.cnas.ro/default/index/index/lang/EN">National Health Insurance House</a> (NHIH) and are therefore eligible for the same access to state healthcare as Romanian nationals. Your contribution will be automatically deducted from your salary and you may be entitled to free medical insurance if you meet the eligibility requirements</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance if you are not eligible for local schemes or while you are applying for residency</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a UK posted worker, you may need to buy additional healthcare insurance in Romania so you can receive the healthcare treatment you need.</p>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>
<p>Your S1 certificate may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Romania and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-romania-after-brexit">Studying in Romania after Brexit</h3>
<p>Your EHIC may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Romania and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Romania before Brexit, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after Brexit should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>
<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>
<p>If you are living in Romania and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or EHIC, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK.</p>

<p>You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Romania before Brexit, you can use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge when visiting the UK after exit day if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</a>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>
<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="ehic">European Health Insurance Cards (EHIC)</h3>
<p>Your EHIC may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Romania and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance in you’re planning to visit Romania.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need.</p>

<p>If you have any pre-existing conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>You should prepare for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national travelling to Romania.</p>

<p>UK-issued EHICs will still be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your EHIC can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Romania and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Romania. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you are a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to liaise with a different team depending on the exportable benefit. You can find more information under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania">Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)</a> provides information about what UK and Romanian benefits are available to Britons living in Romania.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Romania. The government always advises UK citizens to take out comprehensive travel insurance when going overseas.</p>

<p>Your <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">EHIC</a> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an EHIC.</p>

<p>Your EHIC enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in Romania at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free if you are staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Check you are being treated by a healthcare provider in the state system as you will not be covered for private healthcare with an EHIC.</p>

<p>There is state and private healthcare in Romania. State medical care in Romania is managed by the <a rel="external" href="http://www.cnas.ro/default/index/index/lang/EN">National Health Insurance House</a> (NHIH), which provides free or subsidised care to all Romanian residents.</p>

<p>Private health services are expanding in Romania with services requiring patient payments for treatment and receipts are issued so patients can be reimbursed by their private insurers.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>
<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Romania if you have a pre-existing health condition. You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>The Money and Pensions Advice Service has information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions">buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a></p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medication with you.</p>

<p>If you are travelling to have medical planned treatment, read the NHS guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">seeking medical treatment in Europe</a>.</p>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>
<p>If you have a serious, life-threatening emergency or you need an ambulance, you should call 112. This number is free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="dentists">Dentists</h3>
<p>Dental treatment is not covered by the state healthcare system, unless it’s an emergency.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>
<p>You’ll need to be referred by a doctor for any specialist treatment. Check that you are referred to a state hospital as only these provide treatment with an EHIC. Double-check you are not treated as a private patient.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>
<p>Your prescription will be free or subsidised depending on your individual circumstances. The list of medicines that fall into the free category is published by the National Health Insurance Authority.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-own-medicines-to-romania">Bringing your own medicines to Romania</h2>
<p>Some prescribed medicines contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in the UK. This means that additional legal controls apply to these medicines.</p>
