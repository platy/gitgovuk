<h2>The Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review - setting the UK’s broadband targets</h2>

<p>In July 2018 the Government published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-telecoms-infrastructure-review">The Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review</a> that set clear, ambitious targets for the availability of full fibre and 5G networks.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>What does gigabit-capable mean?</strong></p>

<p>A gigabit is the fastest and most reliable available broadband speed and is the same as 1,000 megabits per second (Mbps) - so it’s a big leap forward in connection speeds that will benefit you into the future, whether at home or work.
Gigabit-capable means that the connection can handle speeds of 1,000 Mbps but users only sign up to speeds they can afford. As demand increases, users can choose the option to pay for more speed as required.</p>
</div>

<p>An ‘outside-in’ approach was proposed in the review to ensure that gigabit-capable broadband to premises in the final 10% can be delivered along with the rest of the UK. Since the report was published, the scope of this scheme for the hardest to reach premises has increased from the final 10% to 20%.</p>

<p>In May 2019, the Chancellor announced a £5 billion commitment to fund gigabit-capable broadband for the hardest to reach 20% of homes and businesses and in the Spending Review in November 2020 the budgetary phasing of the programme was confirmed.</p>

<p>In December 2020, BDUK launched the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/947250/20201222_-_Planning_for_Gigabit_Delivery_in_2021_V2.pdf" rel="external">‘Planning for Gigabit in 2021’</a> consultation with communications network providers and local authorities followed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/project-gigabit-phase-one-delivery-plan">Project Gigabit Phase One Delivery Plan</a> in March 2021.</p>

<p>The latest update on the procurement pipeline is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/project-gigabit-delivery-plan-winter-update">Project Gigabit Delivery Plan - winter update</a>.</p>

<h2>UK Gigabit Programme</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/119120/Project_Gigabit_image.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>The UK Gigabit Programme or ‘Project Gigabit’ is a £5 billion government infrastructure project that brings together everything the government is doing to enable and deliver fast and reliable digital connectivity for the entire country. Through one of the fastest rollouts in Europe, two thirds of households now have access to gigabit speeds by the end of 2021 - a huge leap from 2019 when it was just one in ten.</p>

<p>As part of this programme BDUK is launching phased contracts to those hard to reach parts of the UK that will need government support towards the cost of gigabit-capable broadband.</p>

<p>To complement this work and to support pace of delivery, there are three other elements to Project Gigabit:</p>

<h3>Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme</h3>

<p>There is up to £210 million to give people in eligible rural areas immediate financial help to get gigabit-capable speeds. The scheme is accessible through broadband service providers that have registered to provide connections through the scheme.</p>

<p>Vouchers worth up to £1,500 for homes and £3,500 for businesses help to cover the costs of installing gigabit broadband to people’s doorsteps.</p>

<p>You can check if you’re eligible for a voucher at your address on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gigabitvoucher.culture.gov.uk/" rel="external">Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme website</a>.</p>

<h3>Gigabit Hubs</h3>

<p>There is up to £110 million available to connect public sector buildings - such as GP surgeries, libraries and schools - in hard to reach parts of the UK.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gigahubs-key-information">GigaHubs: key information</a>.</p>

<h3>Superfast Programme</h3>

<p>Now largely gigabit-capable, Superfast will reach half of the remaining premises that have broadband speeds of less than 30 megabits per second (Mbps). In late 2020, the government approved a further £490 million of new contracts signed at the end of last year to provide mainly gigabit-capable coverage to a further 172,000 premises.
Information and take-up data on all procurements on the Superfast Broadband Programme can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hs00bNsyRV1WoOt-fow3rsNXzpcKg26AsOWvk1bvJRk/edit#gid=1411146266" rel="external">table of local broadband projects spreadsheet</a>. The spreadsheet also contains links to gainshare consultations published by local broadband projects.</p>

<h3>Barrier Busting</h3>

<p>In order to support pace of delivery for network providers, the government has also published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/barrier-busting-task-force-next-steps">update on the work of its Barrier Busting Taskforce</a>.</p>

<h3>Very Hard to Reach Premises</h3>

<p>The UK has some very remote places for which the cost of a gigabit-capable network may be too expensive, even with substantial public subsidy and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/improving-broadband-for-very-hard-to-reach-premises">call for evidence</a> is currently underway to explore the barriers to improving their broadband and how innovative new technologies might help change this.</p>

<h2>Public reviews</h2>

<p>Building Digital UK will be seeking views from the public and other stakeholders with regard to existing or planned commercial gigabit capable broadband in areas open for public review. All areas currently open for public review can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-gigabit-programme-public-reviews">UK Gigabit Programme: public reviews</a> page. Each public review will take place over a specified time period and will be replicated on the corresponding county council’s broadband web pages.</p>

<h2>Current mobile infrastructure projects</h2>

<h3>Shared Rural Network</h3>

<p>The Shared Rural Network (SRN) is part of the UK Mobile Programme and will see the government and the four mobile network operators (Vodafone, O2, Three and EE) jointly invest over £1 billion to increase 4G mobile coverage throughout the UK to 95% by the end of programme, underpinned by legally binding coverage commitments.</p>

<p>The £532 million investment by mobile network operators is supported with more than £500 million of government funding to significantly reduce ‘total not-spots’: hard-to-reach areas where there is currently no coverage from any operator. This will provide new digital infrastructure in total not spot areas not commercially viable for the operators.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it will also level up the country by improving mobile coverage for an extra 280,000 premises and 16,000km of roads – giving the UK the world-class digital infrastructure it deserves.</p>

<p>The programme will lead to increases in coverage across all four nations, with the biggest coverage improvements in rural parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.</p>

<p>The four mobile operators have already commenced work on the first element of the SRN programme which is funded by the industry, and are on track to eliminate the majority of partial not-spots - areas where there is coverage from at least one but not all operators - by mid-2024.</p>

<p>Now that funding has been released for the total not-spot element of the programme the government and the operators remain confident that combined coverage will be delivered to 95% of UK geography by the end of 2025, with areas around the UK starting to see improvements to 4G coverage long before completion.</p>

<p>DCMS has published a transparency notice in compliance with the UK’s subsidy obligations under the UK–EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA). The notice sets out how the programme meets the TCA’s subsidy control principles. You can read more in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shared-rural-network-transparency-commitment-publication">transparency commitment publication</a>.</p>

<h2>Programmes closed to new applicants</h2>

<h3>Rural Gigabit Connectivity Programme: 2019-2021</h3>

<p>The Rural Gigabit Connectivity (RGC) programme was a pilot to test ways in which the government could stimulate the market and provide targeted investment in hard to reach areas of the UK.</p>

<p>Eligible public sector buildings that met qualifying criteria set by BDUK received gigabit-capable connectivity thereby enhancing a public service and improving commercial viability for the surrounding area.
It also featured a rural voucher, where communities could pool funding together to fund the cost of building gigabit-capable broadband to their area.</p>

<h3>Local Full Fibre Networks Programme: 2017–2021</h3>

<p>The Local Full Fibre Networks (LFFN) programme was designed to stimulate commercial investment in full fibre networks in both rural and urban locations across the whole of the UK and was funded by the National Productivity Investment Fund.</p>

<p>Since 2017, LFFN has initiated three waves of a capital grant programme - called the Challenge Fund - funding public connectivity projects in gigabit-capable connections. Concurrently the programme set up the Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme and a project on rail connectivity run jointly with the 5G.</p>

<p>The BDUK team continues to provide support and guidance to the local bodies leading the Wave 2 and Wave 3 projects to ensure successful delivery by 2021 but the fund concluded on 31st March 2021.</p>

<h3>TransPennine Initiative: 2017–2020</h3>

<p>The Trans-Pennine Initiative (TPI) was a pilot initiative to deliver gigabit-capable infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York.</p>

<p>The initiative tested the viability of using the rail corridor to deploy high capacity, cost effective fibre, aiming to stimulate commercial extension of the fibre footprint to line-side businesses and communities along the route.</p>

<p>For more information about the initiative, please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.networkrail.co.uk/industry-and-commercial/third-party-investors/network-rail-is-open-for-business/connecting-telecom-services" rel="external">Network Rail</a>.</p>

<h3>700MHz Clearance Programme: 2014–2020</h3>

<p>The 700MHz spectrum clearance programme was a government-funded programme to clear airwaves used by Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and PMSE (Programme Makers and Special Events) services in order to meet the growing demand for 5G mobile data.</p>

<p>The last phase of the clearance was completed in August 2020. During the course of the programme, 154 grants for TV infrastructure works were awarded at a value of approximately £270m. Work for the programme was finished under budget and on schedule.</p>

<h3>Government subsidy rules</h3>

<p>Under the United Kingdom/European Union Withdrawal Agreement of October 2019, all awards made prior to the end of the Transition Period (31 December 2020) continue to fall under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-aid-advice">State aid regime</a> for a period of four years and need to be managed in accordance with the rules in that period.</p>

<p>We are developing the UK Gigabit Programme within the UK Subsidy Control Regime and have published detailed guidance on the approach. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/project-gigabit-uk-subsidy-advice">Project Gigabit: UK subsidy advice</a>.</p>

<h3>Guidance for local authorities and network providers</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-connectivity-portal">Digital Connectivity Portal</a> provides guidance for local authorities and network providers on improving connectivity in local areas.</p>
