<h2>How to report fraud</h2>

<p>If your charity has been the victim of fraud, it’s important to report it to the relevant authorities. Reporting can help you access essential advice to get your charity back on track, but will also build a clearer picture of the scale of fraud affecting the wider sector.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk" rel="external">report attempted or actual fraud to Action Fraud</a>.</p>

<p>Action Fraud is a national reporting centre specifically for reporting frauds and has an online fraud reporting service, available 24 hours a day. The website includes an <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/a-z_of_fraud" rel="external">A to Z of fraud types</a>.</p>

<p>For essential advice on why, what and how to report fraud incidents to the Charity Commission, read our guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-report-a-serious-incident-in-your-charity">how to report a serious incident in your charity</a>.</p>

<h4>Text version of the infographic: top tips for responding to fraud when things go wrong</h4>

<p>If in doubt, take action and report it.</p>

<p>Act quickly. This will minimise harm done and maximise your legal options.</p>

<p>Do not panic, stay calm and follow procedure (wherever you can)</p>

<p>Find out in advance who needs to be informed (both inside and outside the charity)</p>

<p>Have a ‘fraud response plan’ ready so that everyone knows what to do and when</p>

<p>Take steps to preserve evidence. You may need this for investigative or legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Seek professional legal advice, especially if you think you might take action in the civil courts.</p>

<h2>How to protect against different types of fraud</h2>

<p>Fraud is a serious problem that you can’t afford to ignore. Charities can, and should do more, to be fraud-aware. Fraud poses a serious risk to valuable funds and sensitive data, and can damage the good reputation of charities, affecting public trust and confidence in the sector as a whole.</p>

<p>Charity trustees have a duty to manage their charity’s resources responsibly and ensure that funds are protected, applied and accounted for.</p>

<p>With a total annual income of over £69 billion, the charity sector is vulnerable to fraud and financial crime. It’s essential that trustees put in place suitable counter-fraud measures – even small changes can help protect charities from harm.</p>

<p>It’s vital that all money given to charities is used for legitimate and lawful purposes.</p>

<h3>Insider fraud</h3>

<p>Fraud can come from internal sources (insider fraud), for example by employees and volunteers, or from external sources such as fake emails set up by hoaxers.</p>

<p>You can find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fraudadvisorypanel.org/resources/insider-fraud-e-learning-resource/" rel="external">preventing insider fraud in this e-learning video</a> on the Fraud Advisory Panel website.</p>

<p>We have also published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/focus-on-insider-fraud-in-charities">research report about insider fraud</a> and how it is affecting charities. The report includes wider lessons, case studies and tips to help you prevent insider fraud.</p>

<h3>Financial fraud</h3>

<p>Fraud and financial crime is one of the most common types of abuse for charities. These are highlighted in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tackling-abuse-and-mismanagement-in-charities">tackling abuse and mis-management reports</a>.</p>

<p>Charity trustees can avoid basic mistakes and make sure their charity is well protected by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring strong financial management and good governance</li>
  <li>putting in place financial controls and ensuring they’re applied robustly</li>
  <li>reading our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/internal-financial-controls-for-charities-cc8">guidance on internal financial controls for charities (CC8)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some charities, such as shops or trading outlets, have a higher risk of financial loss or falling victim to fraud, due to the nature of their activities.</p>

<p>If your charity relies upon cash-based fund raising, it may be more vulnerable to opportunist and organised fraudsters. For advice on protecting your charity from fraud and financial crime, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-fraud-and-financial-crime">Chapter 3 of the Compliance Toolkit</a>.</p>

<p>Charities should take a proactive approach to reducing fraud risk by following best practice advice and practical tips, such as those outlined in <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/649643/CounteringFraud2016.pdf">Charity Finance Group’s Countering Fraud Manual</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">858 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">35 pages</span>)</span>.</p>

<h2>About cyber crime and reporting a live attack</h2>

<p>The risks to your charity from cyber crime are increasing all the time. It’s a huge problem, which all organisations need to be aware of and guard against. The vast majority of fraud is now committed online.</p>

<p>Cyber crimes can be quite complex and difficult to detect, often involving data breaches or identity fraud. It’s important that you consider how best to protect your charity’s valuable assets from harm online.</p>

<p>The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has produced an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/ncsc-cyber-security-training-for-staff-now-available" rel="external">e-learning training package: ‘Stay Safe Online: top tips for staff’</a>. It’s free, easy to use and takes less than 30 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>The training explains why cyber security is important and how attacks happen. It then covers 4 key areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>defending yourself against phishing</li>
  <li>using strong passwords</li>
  <li>securing your devices</li>
  <li>reporting incidents</li>
</ol>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/cyberessentials/" rel="external">Cyber aware website</a> has an online assessment tool so you can check how cyber secure your charity is. Advice and guidance is provided after the assessment to help you meet the standard. You can also download <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/cyberessentials/docs.html" rel="external">Cyber Essentials documents</a> to help you put essential security controls in place.</p>

<p>For an insight into the mindset of cyber hackers, you can read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nature.com/news/how-to-hack-the-hackers-the-human-side-of-cybercrime-1.19872?error=cookies_not_supported&amp;code=2884a056-dd30-4af9-9f00-290b7cf8e589" rel="external">the human side of cybercrime</a> in the journal ‘Nature’.</p>

<p>You can learn more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fraudadvisorypanel.org/resources/cyber-fraud-e-learning-resource/" rel="external">protecting your charity against cyber fraud in this e-learning video</a> on the Fraud advisory Panel website.</p>

<p>For more advice on guarding against cyber crime visit the following websites:</p>

</ul>

<p>Taking a few simple actions today is a good start - you don’t need to be a technology expert to protect your charity.</p>

<h3>Get help if experiencing a live cyber attack</h3>

<p>Action Fraud has launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://actionfraud.police.uk/24-7-live-cyber-reporting" rel="external">24/7 live cyber-attack helpline</a>. In the event of a live cyber-attack, this helpline gives access to specialist advisors who can offer advice and support to charities or other organisations in reporting the attack. These reports are immediately sent to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB).</p>

<p>To prevent cyber criminals from operating, the NFIB will then assess whether there are any websites, bank accounts or phone numbers that can be closed down. The reports are also sent to the relevant law enforcement agency for investigation if necessary.</p>

<h2>Cyber security toolkit for charity boards</h2>

<p>Charity boards have an important role in improving the cyber security of their organisations. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/board-toolkit" rel="external">National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) board toolkit</a> has been designed for larger charities, to encourage essential discussions about cyber security between the board and wider staff or volunteer body.</p>

<p>Board members don’t need to be technical experts, but they should be able to have a fluent conversation with their experts and understand the right questions to ask.</p>

<p>The board toolkit covers a range of cyber security topics, starting with an introduction to cyber security specifically written for board members. Other topics include understanding the threat, collaborating with suppliers and partners, and planning a response to a cyber incident.</p>

<p>Each topic has straightforward guidance and helpful questions that board members can ask their technical teams. It can be adapted to fit a charity’s own unique cultures and priorities, and was created using genuine insights from boards about what they would like to know.</p>
