<p>A Real Estate Investment Trust (<abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr>) is exempt from UK tax on the income and gains of its property rental business. Corporation Tax is payable on its profits and gains from any other activities.</p>

<p>As a <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ll pay at least 90% of your property rental business income to shareholders each year</li>
  <li>your investors will be taxed on this income as if they’ve received income from property directly</li>
</ul>

<p>You’re a ‘property rental business’ when you make money from land for rent. It does not include money made from the occupation of land. This is chargeable as property business income — for example, farming or running a hotel are chargeable as trades so are not classed as a ‘property rental business’.</p>

<h2>Who can apply</h2>

<p>A company or principal company of a group can apply to be a <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has an existing property rental business of at least 3 properties, where no one property represents more than 40% of the total value of properties involved</li>
  <li>is UK resident for tax purposes</li>
  <li>is not an open ended investment company</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>You must write to HMRC to apply to be a <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> before you can convert to <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> status. Email your application to  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:reit.lb@hmrc.gov.uk">reit.lb@hmrc.gov.uk</a>, or post it to:</p>

  <li>the date by which your accounts will be prepared</li>
  <li>the start and end dates of the first accounting period</li>

<h2>How to leave the regime</h2>

<p>Notice may be given for withdrawal from the <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> regime. This can be given by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> company or group</li>
  <li>HMRC</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also circumstances where you may be automatically withdrawn from the regime.</p>

<p>The date that withdrawal from the regime will apply from depends on how the notice to withdraw is given.</p>

<h3>When you give notice to withdraw</h3>

<p>If your company or group of companies wish to leave the <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> regime, you must give notice in writing by post or email. You should send this to the tax office that deals with your company or group.</p>

<p>You must tell us the date you wish to leave the regime, which must be a date in the future. The regime will then cease on that date.</p>

<p>If your business is still trading you’ll revert to Corporation Tax.</p>

<p>We will confirm receipt of your withdrawal notice by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>email — if you’ve given us consent to email you</li>
  <li>post — if you’ve not given email consent</li>
</ul>

<h3>When HMRC gives notice to withdraw</h3>

<p>HMRC may withdraw you from the regime if you fail to meet certain conditions required to remain within the regime, or if you attempt to use the regime to obtain a tax advantage.</p>

<p>Read more technical information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/investment-funds/ifm26025">the conditions required to remain in the regime</a>.</p>

<p>We will tell you why we have withdrawn you from the regime.</p>

<p>The regime will stop on the date at the end of the accounting period before the one in which the event that triggered the issue of the notice.</p>

<h3>Automatic withdrawal</h3>

<p>You will automatically be withdrawn from the regime if you cease to be UK resident for tax purposes or become an open-ended investment company.</p>

<p>You will also automatically be withdrawn from the regime if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the company or principal <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> company no longer meets the requirements of Condition C regarding the shares, unless this is because the <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> company or the principal company of the group <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> becomes a member of another group <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you issue a new class of ordinary shares or any other type of share apart from non-voting restricted preference shares</li>
  <li>you borrow on terms that entitle the lender to a share of the profits or otherwise breach the rules of section 528(8) <abbr title="Corporation Tax Act">CTA</abbr> 2010</li>
</ul>

<p>The regime will cease to apply from the end of the accounting period before the breach occurs. There are specific exemptions that may apply on demerger, both on the disposal of an asset and a company leaving the group <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr>.</p>

<p>After the 3 year period from receiving <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> status, you must not be a close company. You will not be considered a close company if you are only a close company because you have a participator as an institutional investor, as defined under section 528 (4A) <abbr title="Corporation Tax Act">CTA</abbr> 2010.</p>

<p>If you breach this condition, the regime will cease to apply from whichever comes later out of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the end of the 3 year period from receiving <abbr title="Real Estate Investment Trust">REIT</abbr> status</li>
  <li>the end of the accounting period before the breach occurred</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to appeal against a decision</h2>

<p>You must appeal in writing within 30 days from the date we issue the notice.</p>
