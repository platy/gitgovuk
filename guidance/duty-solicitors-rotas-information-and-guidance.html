<h2>Application information (for organisations on the October 2022 duty solicitor rotas)</h2>

<h3>Duty solicitor rotas: 3 January 2023 to 31 March 2023</h3>

<p>For organisations on the October 2022 duty solicitor rotas, the CRM12 application deadline for adding duty solicitors to the next set of rotas commencing 3 January 2023 is 23:59 Monday 10 October 2022.</p>

<p>Organisations on the October 2022 rotas must use the new 2022 CRM12 form at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/crm12-duty-solicitor-application-when-moving-firm">CRM12: duty solicitor application when moving firm</a> to submit their application.</p>

<p>Completed applications should be saved as an excel file and emailed to  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:crm12@justice.gov.uk">crm12@justice.gov.uk</a> by no later than 23:59 Monday 10 October 2022. We will not accept late applications.</p>

<p>The scheme members list below at duty solicitor members lists 1 October 2022 to 2 January 2023 sets out the duty solicitors and organisations for the October 2022 rotas.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Organisations not on the October 2022 rotas must have submitted their CRM12 for the January 2023 rotas through the Bravo portal by 5 September 2022. For queries concerning these applications please send a message through the Bravo portal</p>
</div>

<p>Organisations on the October 2022 rotas should use the new 2022 CRM12:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To add to the January 2023 rotas any newly qualified duty solicitors who will be engaged by you on 3 January 2023 - a copy of their Law Society CLAS certificate should be sent with the CRM12 application.</li>
  <li>To add to the January 2023 rotas any duty solicitors who will move organisations and be engaged by you on 3 January 2023.</li>
  <li>To add to the January 2023 rotas any duty solicitors for any of your offices not on the October 2022 rotas. This only applies where you  have at least one office with duty solicitors on the October 2022 rotas and the offices you are adding had been part of your bid and have passed verification. You must ensure all offices authorised to undertake duty work have duty solicitors on the January 2023 rotas, otherwise you will lose scheme membership for the relevant office(s).</li>
  <li>To change for the January 2023 rotas, the office from which any of your organisation’s duty solicitors on the October 2022 rotas are engaged.  The duty solicitor(s) will move to the duty scheme(s) listed in your organisation’s 2022 contract schedule against the new office.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you become aware that a duty solicitor will cease to be engaged by you, you must email straight away both your contract manager and duty team at  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dutysolqueries@justice.gov.uk">dutysolqueries@justice.gov.uk</a>. You cannot use the CRM12 form and wait until the CRM12 deadline for the next rota period.</p>

<p>We do not need CRM12 applications if there are no changes to be made.</p>

<p>On the CRM12 form please make sure that the correct date is supplied for when the duty solicitor will be engaged by you under the column heading ‘Date duty solicitor will be engaged by your organisation’. The DSCC will use this date to move a duty solicitor from the old to the new organisation and/or old office to new office with the same firm. LAA and DSCC will not be held responsible if duty calls are missed or sent to the wrong place due to an incorrect date being entered on the form.</p>

<p>We expect to publish new member’s lists (not rotas) on our website by Friday 14 October 2022 to allow firms to check that their duty solicitors are recorded correctly. We ask that feedback is provided by email only, so that we can keep a record of any issues and amend and respond accordingly to those who raise them. The deadline for us to receive feedback relating to the members lists will be Thursday 20 October 2022.</p>

<h2>Duty solicitor members lists 1 October 2022 to 2 January 2023</h2>

<p>The members lists will generally only show rota schemes. Courts will only be listed separately where a choice had to be made from alternative options or if there are restrictions on eligibility due to postcode. All other courts are included on the normal rota schemes.</p>

<p>Organisations should check that all duty solicitors are listed correctly. Organisations may contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:crm12@justice.gov.uk">crm12@justice.gov.uk</a> regarding any inaccuracies with the members lists. We are unable to accept any new requests for changes to the October 22 rotas, and we cannot accept requests from individual duty solicitors. We ask that queries are sent by email only to the above address, so that we can keep a record and respond accordingly to those who raise them. The deadline for us to receive feedback relating to the members lists is Friday 12 August 2022.</p>

<p>Organisations are reminded of their obligation to ensure that their contact details are accurate and kept up to date via the Duty Solicitor Contact Centre website in accordance with paragraph 9.22 of the 2022 Standard Crime Contract Specification.</p>

<p>We expect to publish the new rotas mid-September 2022.</p>
