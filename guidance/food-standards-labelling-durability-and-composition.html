<p>Food compositional standards generally apply to foods that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consumers expect to be of a certain quality</li>
  <li>are at risk of being substituted for lower quality alternatives</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide covers food compositional standards rules in England, but similar rules apply across the UK.</p>

<p>You can sell food products from other parts of the UK in England if your products comply with either the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>food compositional standards and labelling rules</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uk-internal-market-act-2020/complying-with-the-uk-internal-market-act-2020-for-trade-in-goods-guidance-for-traders#mutual-recognition">mutual recognition principle</a></li>

</div>

<p>When marketing food, you must label your food with a name that represents the food honestly. This is so you do not mislead consumers.</p>

<p>Some foods have â€˜reserved descriptionsâ€™ which you can only use if the food has a certain composition.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br>
A product labelled â€˜beef burgerâ€™ must contain at least 62% beef and an â€˜economy beef burgerâ€™ must contain at least 47% beef.</p>
</div>

<p>Foods that have a â€˜reserved descriptionâ€™ and are covered in this guide are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bottled water</li>
  <li>bread and flour</li>
  <li>cocoa and chocolate products</li>
  <li>fats and oils</li>
  <li>fruit juices and nectars</li>
  <li>honey</li>
  <li>jams and similar products</li>
  <li>products containing meat</li>
  <li>milk and milk products</li>
  <li>soluble coffee and chicory extracts</li>
  <li>specified sugar products such as sucrose or glucose syrups</li>
</ul>

<h2>International standards</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fao.org/fao-who-codexalimentarius/en/" rel="external">Codex Alimentarius</a> is a large international body which sets food standards, guidelines and codes of practice in the international trade of food and agricultural products.</p>

<p>The Codex international standards are voluntary good practice and not legally binding. They aim to ensure the safety, quality and fairness in international food trade and protect consumers. UK foods standards generally go above and beyond the Codex standards.</p>

<p>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) is the Codex contact in the UK. For any questions, email Codex.</p>

<h2>Bottled water</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of bottled water with rules that producers need to follow to produce and market it to the public.</p>

<p>These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/natural-mineral-water-how-to-produce-and-label">natural mineral water</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/spring-water-how-to-produce-and-label">spring water</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bottled-drinking-water-how-to-produce-and-label">bottled drinking water</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Read the guidance to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/compare-types-of-bottled-water">compare natural mineral water, spring water and bottled drinking water.</a></p>

<p>You can check the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recognition-of-natural-mineral-water-inside-and-outside-the-uk">recognised natural mineral waters in the UK.</a></p>

<p>These rules are laid out in law in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2785/contents/made" rel="external">The Natural Mineral Water, Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water (England) Regulations 2007.</a></p>

<h2>Bread and flour</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/141" rel="external">Bread and Flour Regulations 1998</a> lay down labelling and compositional standards for bread and flour. The regulations define terms such as â€˜wholemealâ€™ and â€˜self-raisingâ€™.</p>

<p>You should make sure that iron, niacin, thiamine and calcium are added to wheat flour (except wholemeal) thatâ€™s produced in or imported into England. These rules aim to protect the publicâ€™s health.</p>

<p>You can sell flour produced in England that does not comply with the regulations if itâ€™s to be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>directly exported from England to a country outside the UK and is not sold to consumers in England</li>
  <li>used only in products that are exported directly to a country outside the UK and are not sold to consumers in England</li>
</ul>

<p>The addition of calcium is not required for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>self-raising flour which has a calcium content of not less than 0.2%</li>
  <li>wheat malt flour</li>
</ul>

<p>The regulations also do not apply to flour that is used in the manufacture of :</p>

<ul>
  <li>communion wafers</li>
  <li>matzos</li>
  <li>gluten</li>
  <li>starch</li>
  <li>any concentrated preparation that assists the addition of calcium carbonate, iron, niacin and thiamine to flour</li>
</ul>

<p>You can import flour that does not comply with the regulations into England from a country outside the UK if the flour both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>was lawfully produced and sold in that country</li>
  <li>will be used in England to produce food which will be exported outside the UK and will not be sold to consumers in England</li>
</ul>

<p>Bread produced in England for direct export to a country outside the UK does not need to comply with the labelling and compositional rules, providing itâ€™s not sold to consumers in England.</p>

<h3>Flour: importing and manufacturing in England from 1 October 2022</h3>

<p>The exemptions for imports from the EU will change on 1 October 2022. 
From 1 October 2022, white and brown wheat flour imported into England from the EU must be fortified if itâ€™s either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sold directly to consumers or businesses in England</li>
  <li>used in products marketed or sold in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You must follow these rules even if you import flour from the EU into England that originally came from a non-EU country.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2022, you can only import unfortified white and brown wheat flour from EU and non-EU countries into England if itâ€™s lawfully produced and sold in the country youâ€™re importing the flour from.</p>

<p>It must also be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>directly exported from England to a country outside the UK and not sold to consumers in England</li>
  <li>used only in products that are exported from England to a country outside the UK and not sold to consumers in England</li>
</ul>

<p>You can continue to manufacture products in England with unfortified white and brown wheat flour from 1 October 2022 if the flour was both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>legally imported from the EU</li>
  <li>imported at any time before 1 October 2022</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bread: importing and manufacturing in England from 1 October 2022</h3>

<p>The exemptions for imports from the EU, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein (the European Economic Area, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) will change on 1 October 2022.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2022, bread you import from the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> to England must not contain or have been prepared with flour bleaching agents.</p>

<p>Bread labelled or advertised as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€˜wholemealâ€™ must contain 100% wholemeal flour</li>
  <li>â€˜wheat germâ€™ must have at least 10% added processed wheat germ</li>
</ul>

<p>You can continue to sell and use bread in England that does not meet these rules after 1 October 2022 if it was both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lawfully marketed in an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country (even if it originally came from a non-<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country)</li>
  <li>imported at any time before 1 October 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cocoa and chocolate products</h2>

<p>Certain cocoa and chocolate products must comply with the reserved descriptions set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/1659/contents/made" rel="external">Cocoa and Chocolate Products Regulations 2003</a>. The rules lay down the composition of cocoa and chocolate products including setting minimum ingredient and specific labelling requirements. The amount of cocoa solids and milk solids that must be present are stipulated, as well as allowing only certain additional ingredients to be added.</p>

<p>A cocoa solids declaration such as X% minimum is required for most chocolate products covered by the rules and where appropriate a milk solids declaration is also required. This enables consumers to make informed decisions about the type of chocolate they want to buy.</p>

<h2>Fats and oils</h2>

<p>There are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/made" rel="external">general labelling rules for fats and oils</a> when labelling them as an ingredient â€˜vegetable oil or fatâ€™.</p>

<h3>Importing spreadable fats into England from 1 October 2022</h3>

<p>From 1 October 2022, you will not be able to import spreadable fats from Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein into England that do not meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1287/contents/made" rel="external">labelling and compositional rules</a> for sale or supply to consumers in England - for example, through restaurants, hospitals or canteens.</p>

<h3>Olive oil</h3>

<p>Olive oil products have specific requirements relating to chemical and sensory characteristics. Read the detailed guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/olive-oil-regulations-and-inspections">olive oil labelling, packaging and inspections.</a></p>

<h2>Fruit juices and nectars</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/2775/contents/made" rel="external">Fruit Juice and Fruit Nectars (England) Regulations 2013</a> bring together all rules on fruit juices and fruit nectars by setting minimum compositional standards.</p>

<p>These rules define terms such as fruit juice, fruit juice from concentrate, concentrated fruit juice, water extracted fruit juice and fruit nectar. For example, orange juice must have a minimum brix (sugar) level of 11.2.</p>

<p>They also lay down permitted authorised ingredients and treatments in the manufacture of fruit juices.</p>

<h2>Honey</h2>

<p>Honey composition and labelling is controlled by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1348/made" rel="external">The Honey (England) Regulations 2015</a>. This legislation lays down reserved descriptions that must be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the source from which the honey is obtained (for example, blossom, honeydew)</li>
  <li>the processes by which itâ€™s obtained (for example, drained, extracted)</li>
  <li>the way itâ€™s presented (for example, comb, chunk honey)</li>
</ul>

<p>The regulations lay down detailed specifications honey must comply with in terms of its composition and sets out some general quality criteria for honey.</p>

<p>If you use one of the reserved descriptions (for example, â€˜comb honeyâ€™ or â€˜honeydew honeyâ€™), your product must be made according to the defined compositional criteria.</p>

<h3>Labelling honey blends</h3>

<p>The regulations contain some specific labelling requirements including a requirement for country of origin labelling. If the honey is a blend of honeys from more than one country, you can choose to use the statement â€˜blend of honeys from more than one countryâ€™ (or similar wording). You can use this statement as an alternative to listing the various countries of origin.</p>

<h3>Period of adjustment</h3>

<p>Honey placed on the UK market before 1 January 2021 can stay on the market using the following origin wording, providing the label was accurate at the time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€˜blend of EU honeysâ€™</li>
  <li>â€˜blend of non-EU honeysâ€™</li>
  <li>â€˜blend of EU and non-EU honeysâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>You can continue to list the countries of origin of honey blends placed on the UK market.</p>

<p>For honey blends sold in England and Wales until 30 September 2022, you can use one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€˜blend of honeys from more than one countryâ€™ (or similar wording)</li>
  <li>â€˜blend of EU honeysâ€™</li>
  <li>â€˜blend of non-EU honeysâ€™</li>
  <li>â€˜blend of EU and non-EU honeysâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>If you continue to use EU terms, you must ensure your label is accurate. For example, a blend of UK and French honey placed on the market in England and Wales would either need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>list both countries</li>
  <li>use the words â€˜blend of EU and non-EU honeysâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because the UK is no longer part of the EU.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2022, you must use â€˜blend of honeys from more than one countryâ€™ (or similar wording) if you decide not to list each country of origin.</p>

<p>For honey blends sold in Scotland, options for labelling origin include using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€˜blend of honeys from more than one countryâ€™ (or similar wording)</li>
  <li>reference to the trading bloc of the countries of origin (for example, â€˜blend of EU honeysâ€™, â€˜blend of non-EU honeysâ€™ or â€˜blend of EU and non-EU honeysâ€™)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you continue to use trading bloc or EU terms, you must ensure your label is accurate. For example, a blend of UK and French honey placed on the market in Scotland would either need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>list both countries</li>
  <li>use the words â€˜blend of EU and non-EU honeysâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because the UK is no longer part of the EU.</p>

<h3>Northern Ireland and the EU markets</h3>

<p>If you place on the Northern Ireland or EU markets a blend of honeys from different countries, you must accurately reflect that GB honey is no longer EU honey and use one of the following terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€˜blend of EU honeysâ€™</li>
  <li>â€˜blend of non-EU honeysâ€™</li>
  <li>â€˜blend of EU and non-EU honeysâ€™</li>
