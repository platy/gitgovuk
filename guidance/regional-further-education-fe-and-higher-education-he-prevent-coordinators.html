<h2>How regional further and higher education Prevent co-ordinators can help providers</h2>

<p>Regional further and higher education Prevent co-ordinators play a key role in the delivery of Prevent, providing further education (<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>) and higher education (<abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>) providers with support to build resilience against the dangers of radicalisation.</p>

<p>They do this through strategic engagement with senior leaders and through the provision of advice, support and training (including <abbr title="workshops to raise awareness of Prevent">WRAP</abbr> - workshops to raise awareness of Prevent) to staff in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>universities</li>
  <li>colleges</li>
  <li>independent <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> providers</li>
  <li>apprenticeship providers</li>
  <li>employer based learning providers</li>
  <li>other forms of <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>They help co-ordinate stakeholders involved in the delivery of Prevent in <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr>, <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> and wider Prevent partners. This ensures there is a full and robust understanding of any regional threat and risk relating to <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Their role might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>briefings to vice-chancellors, principals and governors</li>
  <li>delivering training</li>
  <li>engaging with students</li>
  <li>assisting with institutional policies</li>
  <li>attending compliance working groups and providing advice and guidance in support of referrals and external speaker requests</li>
</ul>

<p>Co-ordinators act as the conduit between <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> providers and other stakeholders, including local authorities, Ofsted, Office for Students, the Police, Home Office and Department for Education.</p>

<p>Chris also spent a brief period of time in 2017 seconded to the Department for Education Prevent and Counter-Extremism policy team.
