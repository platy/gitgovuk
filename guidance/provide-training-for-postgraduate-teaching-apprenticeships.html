<p>There is separate guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-a-postgraduate-teacher-apprentice-guidance-for-employers">employers and local authorities</a> who want to recruit for the postgraduate teaching apprenticeship.</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The postgraduate teaching apprenticeship is an employment-based initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>) route leading to qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Providers</h3>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You must agree on the overall <a class="govuk-link" href="#structure-of-the-apprenticeship">structure of the apprenticeship</a> with employers before the apprentice starts.</p>
</div>

<p>Providers are higher education institutes (<abbr title="higher education institute">HEIs</abbr>) or school-centered initial teacher training (SCITT) providers who are accredited to recommend <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and provide the training to the apprentice.</p>

<p>You can offer the postgraduate teaching apprenticeship alongside other employment-based <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> programmes.</p>

<h3>Apprenticeship levy</h3>
<p>Schools can get value for their apprenticeship levy contribution by using it to pay for the apprenticeship training and assessment costs.</p>

<p>Schools must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>partner with <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers to provide the training</li>
  <li>have a Commitment Statement with you and the candidate before the apprenticeship starts</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="#funding">funding and the apprenticeship levy</a> is available.</p>

<h3>Apprentices</h3>
<p>Apprentices are trainee teachers employed by schools. The apprenticeship allows them to combine paid work with on and off-the-job training.</p>

<h3>Employers</h3>
<p>Employers are the school or local authority that employs the apprentice.</p>

<h3>Lead schools</h3>

<p>Lead schools hold apprenticeship places for schools in a school direct partnership. Lead schools can also be providers.</p>

<h3>Additional grant funding</h3>

<p>Schools in a school direct partnership can access additional grant funding to help meet the costs of the apprentice’s salary.</p>

<h2>Requirements for providers</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>As for any other teacher training routes, apprentices must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-criteria/initial-teacher-training-itt-criteria-and-supporting-advice#entry-criteria">ITT entry requirements</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>You can only provide the postgraduate apprenticeship training if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an accredited <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider</li>
  <li>on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers">register of apprenticeship and training providers (RoATP)</a>
</li>
  <li>an accredited <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider operating as a subcontractor to a provider on the register that can provide apprenticeship training up to a limit of £100,000 a year</li>
</ul>

<h3>Providers to non-levy paying schools</h3>
<p>You can provide training to non-levy paying schools if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are an accredited <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider</li>
  <li>have a non-levy contract with the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA)</li>
</ul>

<p>Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:teaching.apprenticeship@education.gov.uk">teaching.apprenticeship@education.gov.uk</a> to get a list of providers.</p>

<h3>New providers</h3>
<p>You can find guidance on how to apply to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers">register of apprenticeship training providers</a>.</p>

<p>As an approved <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider, you will be exempt from certain parts of the application process.</p>

<p>Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:RoATP.maibox@education.gov.uk">RoATP.maibox@education.gov.uk</a> if you have any questions about becoming an accredited <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider.</p>

<h3>Training period</h3>
<p>Apprentices must train for a minimum of 12 months. The apprenticeship can start at any time of the year.</p>

<h3>Structure of the apprenticeship</h3>
<p>The apprentice must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be employed by the school</li>
  <li>spend 20% of their paid hours in off-the-job training</li>
  <li>be assessed by you to make sure they meet the standards for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>take an end-point assessment (<abbr title="end point assessment">EPA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Off-the-job training includes developing the knowledge, skills, values and behaviours set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a>.</p>

<h3>End-point assessment (<abbr title="end point assessment">EPA</abbr>)</h3>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations">register of end-point assessment organisations (RoEPAO)</a> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>find a list of EPA organisations</li>
  <li>register your interest to become an EPA organisation</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="end point assessment">EPA</abbr> is a holistic test, which includes a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lesson observation</li>
  <li>professional discussion</li>
</ul>

<p>The full <abbr title="end point assessment">EPA</abbr> criteria are available in the teacher assessment plan which you can download from the Institute for Apprenticeships’ <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/teacher/" rel="external">teacher standards</a> webpage.</p>

<p><abbr title="end point assessment">EPAs</abbr> must be carried out by other accredited <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers that have been separate from the training or employment. This is to ensure the <abbr title="end point assessment">EPA</abbr> is fair and there is no conflict of interest.</p>

<h3>Apprenticeship agreement</h3>
<p>Before the apprenticeship starts, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtain evidence that the apprentice has an apprenticeship agreement with the employer</li>
  <li>have a commitment statement with the apprentice and the employer</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about the apprenticeship agreement is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules-for-training-providers/what-is-an-apprenticeship">funding rules for providers</a>.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>You must agree the total cost of the apprenticeship training and assessment with the employer.</p>

<p>The employer is responsible for paying the full cost of training and assessment and the trainee’s salary.</p>

<p>There is a completion element to the funding. 20% of the total training cost or the funding band maximum (whichever is lower) will be withheld until the apprentices complete their end-point assessment (<abbr title="end point assessment">EPA</abbr>). 
For more detailed information, please refer to the ESFA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules-for-training-providers/what-is-an-apprenticeship">funding rules for providers</a>.</p>

<h2>Training and assessment costs</h2>

<h3>Levy paying schools</h3>
<p>Levy paying schools can use up to £9,000 of their apprenticeship service account to cover training and assessment costs for each apprentice they employ. This will be paid directly to you from the employer’s apprenticeship service account.</p>

<h3>Non-levy paying schools and schools with insufficient funds</h3>
<p>These schools are eligible to get funding through government-employer co-investment.
We will pay 95% of the training costs and the school will pay 5% of the total negotiated training cost up to £9,000 for apprenticeships started on or after April 2019.</p>

<h2>Salary</h2>
<p>Schools can get up to £19,400 in additional grant funding to contribute towards the apprentice’s salary depending on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the subject the apprentice is training to teach</li>
  <li>the location of the employing school</li>
</ul>

<p>Information on how schools can access this funding is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-a-postgraduate-teacher-apprentice-guidance-for-employers">guidance for employers</a>.</p>

<p>General funding information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/postgraduate-teaching-apprenticeships-funding-manual">Postgraduate teaching apprenticeship funding manual</a>.</p>

<h2>Recruitment: what lead schools must do</h2>

<h3>Choose a provider</h3>

<p>You must chose an <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://roatp.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/download" rel="external">RoATP</a> before you can get permission to recruit.
Training places are held by the school direct partnership.</p>

<h3>Get permission to recruit</h3>

<p>To get permission to recruit contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk">becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You must have permission to recruit before you advertise.</p>

<p>You do not need permission to recruit if you do not want DfE funding.</p>

<p>You’ll be expected to make requests for permission to recruit for other schools in your partnership. You can do this using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://traineeteacherportal.education.gov.uk/default.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="database of trainee teachers and providers">DTTP</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Advertise courses</h3>
<p>Courses are listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses-in-england">Find postgraduate teacher training courses</a>, DfE’s online search service for potential teachers.</p>

<p>You need to register as a provider using the ‘Publish postgraduate teacher training courses service’, the provider-facing part of the ‘Find’ service. On ‘Publish’, providers can list courses, change contact details and update locations. To register, and for any queries about this service, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk">becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re already registered on ‘Publish’, you can list your courses using your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE sign-in account</a>.</p>

<p>You can also place an advert on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/recruit-apprentice">Recruit an apprentice</a>. It will not affect your funding if you do not do this.</p>

<h2>Grant funding agreements (<abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr>)</h2>
<p>Grant funding agreements are for lead schools with permission to recruit.</p>

<p>You’ll only get your grant funding once you have a <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr> with us.</p>

<p>These steps show you how you can get your <abbr title="grant funding agreement">GFA</abbr>.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Apply for grant apprenticeship funding using the DTTP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete the grant offer letter (GOL) that we will send you following your application for funding, including the highlighted sections and the signature of your accounting officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return your GOL to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:GFA.ittfunding@education.gov.uk">GFA.ittfunding@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the countersigned GOL we send to you as this is part of your GFA and contains important terms and conditions.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Lead schools</h3>

<p>You can apply for grant apprenticeship funding at any time in the year if you are a lead school.</p>
