<p>If you plan to create woodland in England you may be eligible for a grant from the Forestry Commission. We can also provide advice and guidance on the legal regulations you’ll need to follow and how to establish your woodland sustainably. Grants may also be available for planting trees outside of woodland.</p>

<h2>Get support to plan a woodland creation project</h2>
<p>The Forestry Commission can support you to develop the documents you’ll need to plan a woodland creation project.</p>

<h3>Planning a woodland creation project</h3>
<p>You need to carefully design new woodlands to fit within the landscape and accommodate features of interest. To get regulatory approval and grant funding for your project, your woodland creation design plan must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-forestry-standard">UK Forestry Standard</a>.</p>

<p>You need to develop a written plan supported by a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>landscape context plan</li>
  <li>site appraisal plan</li>
  <li>design concept plan</li>
  <li>final woodland creation design plan</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about what these plans need to show, and see examples, in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-guide-to-planning-new-woodland-in-england">Guide to Planning New Woodland in England</a>.</p>

<p>Find out more about the forest design process in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-forestry-standard">UK Forestry Standard</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/design-techniques-for-forest-management-planning-practice-guide">practice guide on Design techniques for forest management planning</a>.</p>

<h3>Woodland Creation Planning Grant</h3>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-creation-planning-grant">Woodland Creation Planning Grant (<abbr title="Woodland Creation Planning Grant">WCPG</abbr>)</a> provides funding to help cover the costs of producing a UK Forestry Standard (<abbr title="UK Forestry Standard">UKFS</abbr>) compliant woodland creation design plan. You can apply for up to £150 per hectare, plus a 70% contribution to any specialist surveys that are needed, capped at £30,000 per project.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-creation-planning-grant">Find out if you’re eligible for the Woodland Creation Planning Grant and how to apply</a></h4>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Woodland Creation Planning Grant">WCPG</abbr> is for planning only and does not provide approval to plant. Proposals with a woodland creation design plan that has been approved for payment through <abbr title="Woodland Creation Planning Grant">WCPG</abbr> are still subject to Environmental Impact Assessment regulations.</p>

<h3>Environmental Impact Assessment (<abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> process involves two stages, but most projects only need to undergo the first stage.</p>

<p>If you want to create a new woodland without grant support from the Forestry Commission you may, depending on the size and location of the proposed project, need to submit a ‘stage 1’<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-impact-assessments-for-woodland">Forestry Environmental Impact Assessment (<abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr>)</a> application.</p>

<p>If your proposal has been through the Woodland Creation Planning Grant and we have approved your woodland creation design plan for grant payment, you can submit the plan alongside your ‘stage 1’ <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> application and you will not need to complete all sections of the application form.</p>

<p>If you are applying for grant support from the Forestry Commission (for example, through the England Woodland Creation Offer), there is no need to engage separately with the <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> process – your grant application to us will be sufficient for us to carry out the <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> process as long as you have included all of the detail asked for in the application. Alternatively, if you have completed the Woodland Creation Planning Grant for your proposal, your approved woodland creation design plan will be used for the <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> process and you don’t need to complete all of the England Woodland Creation Offer application form either.</p>

<p>For more information on the <abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> process, visit our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-impact-assessments-for-woodland"><abbr title="Environmental Impact Assessment">EIA</abbr> overview page</a>.</p>

<h2>Funding and grants for woodland creation</h2>
<p>You may be eligible for funding and grants to create woodland or plant trees. The Forestry Commission offers a range of funding schemes for woodland creation and tree planting, planning, maintenance, and tree health in England.</p>

<h3>England Woodland Creation Offer</h3>
<p>Landowners, land managers and public bodies can receive over £10,000 per hectare to create new woodland on areas as small as one hectare.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/england-woodland-creation-offer">Find out more about the England Woodland Creation Offer and how to apply</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Funding and grants for non-woodland trees</h2>

<h3>Local Authority Treescapes Fund</h3>
<p>Available to local authorities to support the establishment of trees in non-woodland settings. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-authority-treescapes-fund">Find out more about the Local Authority Treescapes Fund</a>.</p>

<h3>Urban Tree Challenge Fund</h3>
<p>The fund provides 50% of published standard costs for planting and establishment of trees in urban or peri-urban areas, especially in areas of low canopy cover and high social deprivation. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/urban-tree-challenge-fund">Find out more about the Urban Tree Challenge Fund</a>.</p>

<h2>Other funding opportunities</h2>

<h3>Earn extra income from selling carbon</h3>
<p>If your project is not cost-effective with a woodland creation grant alone, you might be able to earn further income by selling carbon credits from your project. To do this you need to register with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-woodland-carbon-code-scheme-for-buyers-and-landowners">Woodland Carbon Code</a> within 2 years from the start of planting. Validation/verification to this standard provides assurance of the carbon savings and access to the voluntary carbon market. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-woodland-carbon-code-scheme-for-buyers-and-landowners">Find out more about the Woodland Carbon Code</a> scheme for buyers and landowners and read our <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1041498/FC_Woodland_Carbon_Code_leaflet.pdf">Woodland Carbon Code leaflet</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">824 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">4 pages</span>)</span>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-carbon-guarantee">Woodland Carbon Guarantee</a> provides you with the option to sell your captured carbon in the form of verified carbon credits, called Woodland Carbon Units (WCUs), to the government for a guaranteed price. You must first be registered with the Woodland Carbon Code to be eligible, and planting must not have happened yet. We run multiple auctions per year to allocate Woodland Carbon Guarantee funding, and only those who have already applied are able to take part in future auctions.</p>

<p>You can also read our <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1083262/FC_Fact_Sheet_Carbon_FINAL_14062022.pdf">Woods and carbon factsheet</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">2.76 MB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">8 pages</span>)</span> for more information on how woodland creation can help tackle climate change.</p>

<h2>Creating sustainable woodlands</h2>

<h3>UK Forestry Standard (<abbr title="UK Forestry Standard">UKFS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-forestry-standard">Read the <abbr title="UK Forestry Standard">UKFS</abbr>, the reference standard for sustainable forest management across the UK.</a></p>

<p>This guidance applies to all UK woodland and explains the international agreements and conventions that apply to sustainable forest management to address climate change, help biodiversity and protect soil and water resources. It covers all forestry activities in the UK and sets out the legal requirements and best practice standards for owners of woodland.</p>

<h3>Sustainability best practice</h3>
<p>When designing new woodlands, use the Forest Research tool - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/ecological-site-classification/" rel="external">Ecological Site Classification Decision Support System (ESC-DSS)</a> - to help you select species ecologically suited to your site.</p>

<p>You should also consider how tree species suitability is likely to change in the future. Find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/tree-species-and-provenance/" rel="external">tree species and resilience to climate change</a>.</p>

<p>It is important the plants and trees you use are free from pests and diseases. Where possible, get your plants from nurseries with clear plant health management standards in place including, for example, nurseries with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthy.org.uk/certification" rel="external">Plant Healthy certification</a> or similar.</p>

<h3>Habitats and species protection</h3>
<p>You need to consider habitats and species already present on the land when planning a new woodland. Find out more about:</p>
