<h2>Book and plan your visit to Risley</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>Each visitor party will be allocated a time to arrive at the visitor centre. Arrival times are staggered to allow for adequate social distancing. Visitors will be advised as to which sessions they can attend, based on where the prisoner is resident.</p>

<p>Each visitors group will be allowed to enter the prison with cash to the total value of £40.00 where a hot/cold menu will be available.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>In-cell telephony is now available in all cells.</p>

<p>Prisoners can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a></p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe. Please note all phone calls are recorded. (except for legal etc.)</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at Risley.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Risley</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Purple Visits</h2>

<p>Purple Visits (a secure video call system) are available at Risley.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Risley are given a list of approved items that can be sent to them as gifts. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Risley</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>We do not accept any parcels that have been sent directly from families. Any exception to this will require an application to be approved by the Head of Operations.</p>

<p>The quickest way for a prisoner to receive clothing etc. is for friends or family to send the prisoner money (ideally not cash), the prisoner can then purchase the items via the approved catalogues.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>If HMP Risley receives parcels which have not been approved they will not be issued to the prisoner.</p>

<p>Risley is now allowing underwear and socks through visits again. The process will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Visitors must provide underwear and/or socks in an open bag. No more than 4 pairs of socks and 4 items of underwear per visit. The clothing must be new and have the receipt proving they are new items of clothing. The name and number of the prisoner must be clearly written on the bag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bag will be searched and handed to the visits officer on the desk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the bags will be taken to reception where they will be X-rayed. Once confirmed clear, an Active drug dog will check all the clothing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once confirmed clear, the bags will be sealed, and they will be returned to visits. At the end of visits they will be issued to the relevant prisoners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no dog handler on duty, the clothing will be stored in reception until such a time as a dog handler is on duty. Once the dog handler is on duty, reception staff will X-ray the clothing and the dog handler will examine with an Active dog, once confirmed clear the dog handler will seal the bags.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The items will then be distributed to various wings by reception OSGs.</li>
  <li>Clothing will not be accepted on Saturday or Sunday.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important you’re made aware:</p>

<p>If an unauthorised item is found on the clothing or an indication by the drug dog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The visit will be terminated and the bag will be confiscated as evidence—in some cases the visitor may be arrested and the police called. The visitor may also be banned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an indication occurs on a different day to the visits i.e. clothing which has been stored in reception until a dog handler is on duty; the bag of clothing will be sealed as evidence and later destroyed, the prisoner will be informed this has occurred. This information will be passed to the police and the visitor may be banned from visits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all cases in this section an IR will be submitted and placed on the prisoners security file.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Clothing like this through visits was allowed in the past however this was abused by a small minority where clothing was laced by illegal narcotics, when this came to light this privilege was removed.</p>

<p>Should we receive any intelligence and/or evidence that this is re-occurring this privilege will again be removed for all prisoners.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Life at Risley</h2>
<p>Risley is committed to providing a safe and educational environment where men can learn new skills to help them on release.</p>

<h3>Security and safeguarding</h3>
<p>Every person at Risley has a right to feel safe. The staff are responsible for their safeguarding and welfare at all times.</p>

<p>For further information about what to do when you are worried or concerned about someone in prison <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/pages/category/need-urgent-help?Take=24" rel="external">visit the Prisoners’ Families helpline website</a>.</p>

<p>All safeguarding processes are overseen by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.warrington.gov.uk/warrington-safeguarding-adults-board-wsab" rel="external">Warrington Safeguarding Adults Board</a>.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>
<p>When a prisoner first arrives at Risley, they will be able to contact a family member by phone. This could be quite late in the evening, depending on the time they arrive.</p>

<p>They will get to speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<p>All new prisoners will be required to reverse cohort for the first 14 days at Risley. This means they cannot leave the unit they are on, and cannot have a visit during that time. They will be able to have a shower, have some time in the fresh air and use the phone each day.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>

<p>Induction takes place the day after arrival at Risley and lasts about a week. It has been scaled down to allow for social distancing, but the induction programme does allow for new prisoners to receive important information about life at Risley, and they can ask questions about anything they are unsure of.</p>

<p>They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone also finds out about the rules, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Over 1000 men live at Risley in mostly single rooms.</p>

<p>Risley Prison has a diverse, multi-faith chaplaincy team providing support to prisoners.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>
<p>Prisoners have access to a broad range of vocational training, including interior fitting, painting and decorating, plastering, bricklaying and cleaning. Risley is also part of the Prisons ICT Academy (PICTA) which helps prepare prisoners for work in information and communications technology (ICT) roles.</p>

<p>They can take classroom courses in subjects such as English, maths, art and design and IT. They can also train with the PE department as a gym instructor or take other sports-related qualifications.</p>

<p>Prisoners can work at Risley in contract services workshops as well the kitchens, laundry, gardens and waste management unit. They can also work in the braille workshop which is part of a restorative justice project (where prisoners meet with the victims of crime).</p>
