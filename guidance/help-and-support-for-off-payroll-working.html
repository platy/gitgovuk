<h3>Workshops</h3>

<p>Workshops for small groups of customers will be delivered virtually to provide a comprehensive overview of what the changes mean and will be targeted to specific sectors or customer groups.</p>

<p>These workshops started in November 2020 and HMRC works closely with stakeholders to ensure that the right customers are invited to workshops. Invitations will be sent through trade and representative bodies.</p>

<p>For tax agents, the most relevant workshops will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tax agents — focused on accounting treatment and record keeping for tax agents who deal with contractor’s intermediaries</li>
  <li>sector specific — targeted to specific sectors and the issues that affect them for example banking, oil and gas, public sector and construction, more sectors may be added based on customer feedback</li>
  <li>agencies — focused toward the requirement of recruiter and agencies when dealing with contractors and clients</li>
</ul>
