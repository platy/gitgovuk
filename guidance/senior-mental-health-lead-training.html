<p>This training is not compulsory. We encourage you to identify and train a senior mental health lead, to develop your whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing. This will help your school or college to better promote and support the mental wellbeing of pupils, students and staff, and make best use of existing resources.</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) is offering a £1,200 grant for a senior member of school or college staff to access quality assured training to implement an effective whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing in your setting. Grants of £1,200 are now available to eligible state schools and colleges in England who meet the conditions set out below and wish to commence training before 31 May 2022. This is part of the government’s commitment to offer this training to all eligible schools and colleges by 2025.</p>

<p>The grant is provided to cover (or contribute to) the cost of attending a quality assured course and may also be used to hire supply staff whilst leads are engaged in learning.</p>

<h2>What the training covers</h2>

<p>The <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/995681/Learning_outcomes_for_senior_mental_health_leads_in_schools_and_colleges.pdf">Learning outcomes for senior mental health lead training</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">172 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">9 pages</span>)</span> are aligned with the principles of Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and the Department for Education’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/promoting-children-and-young-peoples-emotional-health-and-wellbeing">promoting children and young people’s emotional health and wellbeing</a>.</p>

<p>Research indicates that taking a coordinated and evidence-informed approach to mental health and wellbeing leads to improved emotional health and wellbeing in children and young people, and greater readiness to learn. Schools and colleges which have taken this approach often report improved attendance, attention, behaviour and attainment.</p>

<p>You can reflect on your setting’s existing approach to mental health and wellbeing using the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the National Children’s Bureau (<abbr title="National Children's Bureau">NCB</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://schoolswellbeing.org.uk/resources/all-resources/filter/wellbeing-mental-health/mental-health-and-wellbeing-secondary" rel="external">preparing for recovery: self-review and signposting tool</a>
</li>
  <li>an approach developed by Oldham Council, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.oldham.gov.uk/info/200807/mental_health/1795/the_whole_school_and_college_approach_to_emotional_health_and_mental_wellbeing" rel="external">the whole school and college approach to emotional health and mental wellbeing</a>

  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.annafreud.org/schools-and-colleges/5-steps-to-mental-health-and-wellbeing/leading-change/" rel="external">Leading Change</a>, developed by the Anna Freud Centre</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who the training is for</h2>

<p>State-funded schools and colleges in England, including those in receipt of ESFA pre-16 revenue, high needs block, or 16 to 19 programme funding are eligible to apply for a grant.</p>

<p>Settings that claimed a grant in the 2021 to 2022 financial year are not eligible to apply for further funding.</p>

<p>Independent settings with fee-paying pupils and students are not eligible for a grant but may access <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> assured training independently.</p>

<p>Senior mental health lead training is available for primary and secondary schools and colleges, including some special and alternative provision, but is not intended to meet the specific needs of early years or adult settings.</p>

<p>All eligible education settings can benefit from senior mental health lead training. Courses are available to meet the learning needs and preferences of senior leads, whatever their level of experience, type of setting or location.</p>

<p>Schools and colleges can decide who is best placed to take on the role of senior mental health lead and undertake the training as every setting’s circumstances are different. Training could be for your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>headteacher</li>
  <li>deputy headteacher</li>
  <li>member of the senior leadership team (<abbr title="senior leadership team">SLT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>if not a senior leader, an appropriate member of staff, working with colleagues, who is empowered to develop and oversee your setting’s whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Existing mental health leads</h3>

<p>Existing mental health leads, or someone who has previously had mental health and wellbeing training, can still be nominated for this training, although settings that claimed a grant in the 2021 to 2022 financial year will not be able to claim any further funding.</p>

<p>While you can still nominate your existing mental health lead if they are not a member of the <abbr title="senior leadership team">SLT</abbr>, you will need to consider whether the individual has the authority, capacity and support to influence and lead strategic change within the setting.</p>

<p>The grant must be used on <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> quality assured training to help develop or introduce your whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing. Existing senior leads might wish to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop or refresh their knowledge and skills in specific priority areas</li>
  <li>get more advanced training</li>
  <li>get a relevant qualification</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mental health support teams (<abbr title="mental health support teams">MHSTs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are already working with an <abbr title="mental health support team">MHST</abbr>, your nominated senior lead can also be your <abbr title="mental health support team">MHST</abbr> coordinator, responsible for liaising with the team, or can be a different member of staff.</p>

<h2>Before you apply for a training grant</h2>

<p>Before you apply for a training grant, you should check that you meet all the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-mental-health-lead-training-grant-funding/senior-mental-health-lead-training-conditions-of-grant-for-the-2022-to-2023-financial-year">eligibility criteria and terms for the training grant</a>, including that you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>committed to develop or implement a whole school or college approach to mental health</li>
  <li>identified a senior mental health lead to oversee your whole school or college approach, and confirmed that they are available to commence training before 31 May 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply for a senior mental health lead training grant</h2>

<p>You can now apply for a senior mental health lead grant to commence training up to 31 May 2022.</p>

<p>When you apply through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinecollections.des.fasst.org.uk/fastform/senior-mental-health-leads" rel="external">grant application service</a> you will be asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide your school or college details to confirm you are an eligible setting</li>
  <li>make a series of declarations as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-mental-health-lead-training-grant-funding/senior-mental-health-lead-training-conditions-of-grant-for-the-2022-to-2023-financial-year">conditions of grant</a> and eligibility criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>You will then receive confirmation (including a confirmation email) that we have successfully received your application. This means you will have successfully reserved a training grant and can therefore proceed to book a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> quality assured training course commencing up to, and including, 31 May 2022.</p>

<p>Please retain evidence of your booking as this will be needed to claim your grant.</p>

<h2>Programme evaluation</h2>

<p>We also ask that you participate in our programme evaluation. This includes providing feedback on your completed training as a condition of your grant. The feedback will help us to understand how the training is supporting schools and colleges to develop their approaches to mental health and wellbeing and inform future support.</p>

<p>We will contact you by email to request your contributions and keep our requests brief to minimise burdens on your time.</p>

<h2>Will there be further opportunities to apply for a grant?</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will confirm the position on issuing grants for courses starting from June 2022 later in the spring.</p>

<p>If you are waiting to apply for a grant for whatever reason, we encourage school leaders to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider your setting’s commitment to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/promoting-children-and-young-peoples-emotional-health-and-wellbeing">whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing</a>
</li>
  <li>identify a senior mental health lead to receive training to oversee your whole school or college approach in the context of wider SEND, pastoral and safeguarding responsibilities</li>
