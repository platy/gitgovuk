<p>Designs are a form of intellectual property. They protect the appearance of the whole or part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, its lines, contours, colour, shape, texture, materials and ornamentation.</p>

<p>A design can be protected if it is new and has individual character compared to designs that are already in the public domain.</p>

<p>Trade marks enable consumers and businesses to differentiate the goods and services of one trader from another. They commonly take the form of words, logos, or a combination of both.</p>

<p>Trade marks are registered rights, with protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> granted by the Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>), the European Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>), or via an international registration filed under the Madrid Protocol at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organisation">WIPO</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="what-will-change-after-brexit">What will change after Brexit</h2>

<p>After Brexit, registered Community designs (<abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>), unregistered Community designs (<abbr title="unregistered community designs">UCDs</abbr>), and protected international trade mark and design registrations designating the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will no longer be valid in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>These rights will be immediately and automatically replaced by <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> rights.</p>

<p>If you own an existing right, you do not need to do anything at this stage.</p>

<p>Design protection can currently be obtained via a registered right or an unregistered right in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a national registered design granted by the Intellectual Property Office of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a registered Community design granted by the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an international registration designating either the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, filed under the Hague Agreement at <abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organisation">WIPO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>unregistered protection can be obtained in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> through the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design right and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> unregistered Community design.</li>
</ul>

<p>After Brexit, any existing <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>, <abbr title="unregistered community designs">UCDs</abbr>, European Union Trade Marks (<abbr title="European Union Trade Mark">EUTM</abbr>), and International (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) Designs and Trade Marks will only cover the remaining <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states.</p>

<h2 id="registered-design">Registered design</h2>

<h3 id="creation-of-the-re-registered-design">Creation of the re-registered design</h3>

<p>All  registered and published <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> will have comparable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> designs, which will be recorded on the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register. These will be treated as if they had been applied for and registered under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>The legislative changes introduced in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will ensure that the holder of an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is provided with an equivalent <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right, even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>They will retain the registration and application dates recorded against the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and will inherit any priority dates.</p>

<p>As fully independent <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> rights, they may be challenged, assigned, licensed or renewed separately from the original <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Re-registered designs will be created at no cost to the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> holder, and we are ensuring that minimal administrative burden will be placed upon the right holder.</p>

<h3 id="numbering-of-re-registered-design">Numbering of re-registered design</h3>
<p>The number allocated to the re-registered design will consist of the full <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> number prefixed with the digit ‘9’.</p>

<p>This will provide users with a means of identifying re-registered rights created from <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and distinguishing them from existing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered designs.</p>

<p>The following examples demonstrate how re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> designs will be codified:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Existing RCD number</th>
      <th scope="col">Re-registered UK design number</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>004048098-0004</td>

    <tr>
      <td>000000021-0001</td>
      <td>90000000210001</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h3 id="pending-applications">Pending applications</h3>

<p>On exit day, there will be a small number of <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> applications that are still pending in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> system.</p>

<p>If you hold a pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application on exit day, you will be able to apply to register a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design in the 9 months after exit day and retain the earlier filing date of the pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<p>To do so, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application must relate to the same design as that filed in the pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application.</p>

<p>If the details of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application do not match those of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application, then the earlier <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> date(s) will not be recognised.</p>

<p>Our digital and paper forms will be amended to include a new section for claiming the earlier filing date of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application.</p>

<p>These applications will be treated as a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design application. They will be examined under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law. In these circumstances, the standard <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> fee structure will apply.</p>

<h3 id="opt-out">Opt out</h3>

<p>We are creating approximately 700,000 re-registered designs on exit, we recognise that some <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> holders may not want to be granted such a right.</p>

<p>Holders of the new right will be allowed to ‘opt out’ of holding it. Opting out will mean that the re-registered design will be treated as if it had never been applied for or registered under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>You may not exercise an opt out right in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if you have assigned, licensed or entered into an agreement in relation to the re-registered design</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you have already launched proceedings based upon it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-request-an-opt-out">How to request an opt out</h3>

<p>To request an opt out, you must submit a short notice providing us with the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> number, along with details of any persons with an interest in the right.</p>

<p>The new law requires that notice to interested third parties must be given for opt out to have effect.</p>

<p>Therefore, where needed, you must confirm that such action has been taken.
Opt out requests should only be submitted after Brexit. Any requests made before exit day will not be valid.</p>

<p>We have created a notice template which you should use when requesting opt out.</p>

<p>The template will be available at GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> after exit, and we will provide a dedicated email address for sending it back to us. Once we have received a request, we will send you confirmation that the right has been removed from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register.</p>

<p>Opt out requests should only be submitted after Brexit. Any requests made before exit day will not be valid.</p>

<h3 id="renewals-and-restoration">Renewals and restoration</h3>

<p>Once re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design rights are created, a separate renewal fee will apply for each re-registered <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design.</p>

<p>Both <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered designs and <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> can be renewed every 5 years up to a maximum of 25 years.</p>

<p>Once a re-registered design is created, a separate renewal fee will apply for both that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> right and the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>. The fees will need to be paid separately to <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> and to <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of future renewal, the re-registered design will retain the existing renewal date of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Under existing law, we send a renewal reminder to any <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design owner whose right is due to expire, and we do so in advance of the expiry date.</p>

<p>This practice will be retained for all re-registered designs with renewal dates which fall more than 6 months after exit day.</p>

<p>However, where the re-registered design expires within the 6 month period that falls after exit day, we will adopt a new procedure.</p>

<p>We are also changing the law to accommodate <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> that have expired in the 6 months before exit day, and which are still in their late renewal period when we leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="designs-which-expire-after-exit-day">Designs which expire after exit day</h3>

<p>The same procedure for renewal and late renewal of registered designs under the Registered Designs Act and the Registered Designs Rules will apply to re-registered designs.</p>

<p>You will be sent a reminder renewal notice on the actual day of expiry (or as soon as is practicable after that date). This notice will inform you that the re-registered design has expired, and that we will provide you with a further 6 month period, running from the date of the notice, in which the right may be renewed.</p>

<p>Where the re-registered design will expire within 6 months after exit day, the usual additional renewal fee will not be payable.</p>

<p>In addition to the new reminder notice being sent on or soon after the day of expiry, those with re-registered designs that expire within the fourth, fifth and sixth months after exit day will also receive the conventional advance reminder notice in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Where the re-registered design is not renewed, it will be removed from the register. It may be restored at a later date in accordance with existing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<p>You should note that where an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>’s renewal date falls after exit day, early payment of the renewal fee at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>, on a date prior to exit day, will have no effect in respect of the re-registered design.</p>

<p>Any re-registered design with a renewal date falling at any time after exit day will be subject to a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> renewal action and fee. This is regardless of whether a renewal action was taken on the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> before exit.</p>

<h3 id="designs-which-expire-before-exit-day">Designs which expire before exit day</h3>

<p>We will also create a re-registered design from any <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>has expired in the 6 months prior to exit day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has not been subject to a late renewal action at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> by exit day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is still within its 6 month late renewal period on exit day</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These re-registered designs will hold an ‘expired’ status. Their continued effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will be dependent upon late renewal of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is subject to late renewal, that renewal will also have effect on the expired re-registered design.</p>

<p>This means that the re-registered design will be automatically renewed as a result of the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>’s late renewal.</p>

<p>In this scenario, you will not be required to pay any renewal fees in respect of your first (<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) renewal of the re-registered design.</p>

<p>If the expired <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is not late-renewed at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>, then the re-registered design (which was created on exit day in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) will be removed from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> register on expiry of the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>’s late renewal period.</p>

<p>It will then be treated as if it had never been applied for or registered under <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law.</p>

<h3 id="rcd-registrations-and-applications-reinstated-after-exit-day">
<abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> registrations and applications reinstated after exit day</h3>

<p>Under the Community Design Regulation, a right that has been struck from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> register because of the applicant or owner’s failure to meet a deadline may be reinstated later and treated as if it had continuous legal effect.</p>

<p>Re-registered designs will only be created from <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> which are registered within 6 months of its renewal date  prior to exit day.</p>

<p>Therefore, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rights which are not registered on that date but which are subject to reinstatement will not automatically result in the grant of re-registered designs.</p>

<p>To address this, the new law provides holders and applicants of reinstated <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rights with the means to preserve those rights in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> are reinstated after exit day, and the proprietor notifies us of such action, we will create a re-registered design.</p>

<p>Reinstatement of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rights can only occur where application is made to the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> within one year of the missed deadline.</p>

<p>If you hold an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> which was reinstated after exit day, and you have not been granted a re-registered design, you should inform us within 6 months of the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr>’s restoration by emailing information@ipo.gov.uk.</p>

<p>If you have a pending <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application which was reinstated after exit day and it holds a filing date prior to exit day, you may submit a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design application claiming the earlier <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> filing and/or priority date.</p>

<p>You can do this within 9 months of the date on which the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> application was restored.</p>

<h2 id="deferred-publication">Deferred publication</h2>

<h3 id="where-publication-of-the-rcd-is-deferred-at-euipo">Where publication of the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is deferred at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Under the new law, an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> that is deferred on exit day will be treated as being equivalent to a pending application.</p>

<p>The publication of an <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> may be deferred at <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> for up to thirty months.</p>

<p>Where deferment is requested, <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> will not publish the design until either the holder has paid a publication fee and the deferment period has elapsed, or the holder requests publication before such expiry.</p>

<p>Whilst the deferment period is ongoing, <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr> will only publish basic details about the right holder and the filing date.</p>

<p>This means that the holder of a deferred <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> can preserve its earlier filing and priority dates in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by filing an equivalent registered design application within nine months after exit day.</p>

<p>The application will not be the subject of a substantive examination, because the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> has already been examined by <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-the-uk-registered-design-to-be-deferred">Applying for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design to be deferred</h3>

<p>There is currently no framework in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation creating the right to defer publication of a registered design.</p>

<p>As a matter of practice, the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> permits applicants to defer publication of their design by up to 12 months.</p>

<p>The examples below explain when a design will be published where the <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> is subject to deferment at the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>, and a corresponding <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application is made which seeks to retain the earlier <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> dates and requests <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> deferment.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design applications, that do not seek to retain earlier filing and priority dates of a corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> that was deferred on exit day, may request <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> deferment in the normal manner.</p>

<p>In such cases, a period of twelve months’ deferment will run from the date on which the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> application was filed. This is regardless of whether that date falls inside or outside of the nine months after exit day.</p>

<h3 id="effect-of-priority-claims">Effect of priority claims</h3>
<p>A priority date claimed under the Paris Convention that has been recorded against the corresponding <abbr title="registered Community design">RCD</abbr> will be inherited by the re-registered design.</p>

<h3 id="how-uk-design-and-international-design-and-trade-mark-law-currently-works">How <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and international design and trade mark law currently works</h3>

<p>The primary <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on registered designs is <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/88/contents">The Registered Designs Act 1949</a>. There is also secondary legislation, mainly contained within the Registered Design Rules 2006, together with amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<p><abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr> and <abbr title="unregistered community designs">UCDs</abbr> are defined by <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32002R0006">Council Regulation (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>) No 6/2002 on Community designs</a>. Registered and unregistered Community designs both have effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Community design regulation has been amended to apply the Hague System for the international registration of industrial designs to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Separately, the Registered Designs Act has been amended to apply the Hague System to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> as an individual country.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> legislation on trade marks is primarily contained in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/26/contents">Trade Marks Act 1994</a>. Secondary legislation appears in the Trade Marks Rules 2008 and other amending and standalone regulations.</p>

<p>Protected international trade marks registrations filed under the Madrid Protocol that designate the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (or both) also currently have effect in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="we-are-changing-uk-design-and-trade-mark-law">We are changing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> design and trade mark law</h3>

<p>After Brexit, all existing <abbr title="registered Community designs">RCDs</abbr>, <abbr title="unregistered community designs">UCDs</abbr>, EUTMs and international design and trade mark registrations designating the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will no longer provide protection in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>As a result, we must amend existing legislation to ensure that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> protection granted by these rights is preserved and allows <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law to continue to function effectively.</p>

<p>In addition, it will be necessary to remove or amend many of the existing references to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, European Economic Areas (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), and Member States will become redundant or inappropriate.</p>

<p>It is necessary to fix these deficiencies to make sure that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law continues to work effectively in this scenario.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we have introduced <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111180037/contents">The Designs and International Trade Marks (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019</a> under the powers contained in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. These regulations should be considered in conjunction with <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2018/9780111175460/contents">The Trade Marks (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> businesses will still be able to obtain registered design protection in the remaining 27 member states of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> through an application to the <abbr title="European Union Intellectual Property Office">EUIPO</abbr>. Businesses from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and worldwide will still be able to apply for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> registered design through the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Designers will also still be able to establish unregistered design protection in both the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> separately.</p>

<p>Businesses may also continue to use the international route for protection following the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s ratification of the Hague Agreement for the international registration of industrial designs and the Madrid Protocol for trade marks.</p>
