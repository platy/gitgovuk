<p>Delivering a deal remains the government’s top priority. However, it is right for the government to prepare for every eventuality, including a no deal scenario.</p>

<p>The UK government has always been clear that we highly value the contributions <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> (European Economic Area) citizens make to the social, economic and cultural fabric of the UK and that we want them to stay in the UK.</p>

<p>To remove any ambiguity, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/policy-paper-on-citizens-rights-in-the-event-of-a-no-deal-brexit">Citizens’ Rights - <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a> policy paper outlines the UK government’s action to protect the rights of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> citizens resident in the UK if the UK leaves without a deal.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> citizens that move to the UK after we leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, the government is working through options for what access they will have to benefits and services.</p>

<h2 id="the-rights-of-eea-nationals-and-their-families-currently-living-in-the-uk-before-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-to-access-social-housing-and-homelessness-assistance">The rights of <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> nationals and their families currently living in the UK before the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to access social housing and homelessness assistance</h2>

<p>The rights and status of <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> nationals and their family members living in the UK before the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will remain the same as now. This means they will continue to be eligible to access social housing, including supported housing, and homelessness assistance on the same terms as now.</p>

<p>In order to deliver the government’s policy intent to maintain the status-quo of eligibility for social housing and homelessness assistance, the current eligibility regulations (the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/1294) have been amended by <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/861/contents/made">The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) (Amendment) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/861)</a>. The Amendment Regulations were laid on 16 April and came into force on 7 May 2019.</p>

<p>These regulations clarify the government’s position on access to benefits and services for those granted pre-settled status under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Settlement Scheme.</p>

<p>A letter was sent to all chief executives of local authorities, chief housing officers and chief officers for children’s services in England informing of this change in legislation.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> citizens who move to the UK after we leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, we are working through options for what access they will have to social housing and homelessness assistance if the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.
Any changes to accessing social housing and homelessness assistance after the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will be in line with the Home Office future immigration system.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-change-for-local-authorities">What will change for local authorities?</h2>

<p>Applications for social housing and homelessness assistance in England are managed by local authorities. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is working with local authorities to ensure they are prepared for any changes to <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> nationals’ eligibility to access social housing and homelessness assistance after the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Further information on how to contact a local authority about housing in England is available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/council-housing">gov.uk</a>.
Housing is a devolved government function.
