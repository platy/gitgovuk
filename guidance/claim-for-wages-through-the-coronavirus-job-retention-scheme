<h2 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll need</h2>

<p>To make a claim, you will need:</p>

  <li>to be registered for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-online/enrol" class="govuk-link">PAYE online</a>
</li>

  <li>the number of employees being furloughed</li>
  <li>each employee’s National Insurance number (you will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-paye-tools-national-insurance-number-verification-requests-only/basic-paye-tools-with-other-software-check-a-national-insurance-number" class="govuk-link">search for their number using basic PAYE Tools</a> if you do not have it, or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/get-help-with-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC</a> if your employee has a temporary number or genuinely has never had one)</li>
  <li>each employee’s payroll or employee number (optional)</li>
  <li>the start date and end date of the claim</li>
  <li>the full amounts that you’re claiming for including:
    <ul>
      <li>employee wages</li>
      <li>employer National Insurance contributions (for claims up to 31 July)</li>
      <li>employer minimum pension contributions (for claims up to 31 July)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>your phone number</li>
  <li>contact name</li>
</ul>

<p>You also need to provide either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name (or the employer’s name if you’re an agent)</li>
  <li>your Corporation Tax unique taxpayer reference</li>
  <li>your Self Assessment unique taxpayer reference</li>
  <li>your company registration number</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re claiming for employees that are flexibly furloughed, you’ll also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of usual hours your employee would usually work in the claim period</li>
  <li>the number of hours your employee has or will work in the claim period</li>
  <li>you will also need to keep a record of the number of furloughed hours your employee has been furloughed in the claim period</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that you provide the data we need to process your claim. Payment of your grant may be at risk or delayed if you submit a claim that is incomplete or incorrect.</p>

<h3 id="using-an-agent-to-do-paye-online">Using an agent to do PAYE online</h3>

<p>If you use an agent who is authorised to do PAYE online for you, they will be able to claim on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you’re using an agent you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get their agent ID (your agent can get this from their HMRC online service for agents account under ‘authorise client’)</li>
  <li>be enrolled for PAYE online for employers</li>
  <li>give them your UK bank account details (only provide bank account details where a BACs payment can be accepted)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to use an agent, but do not have one authorised to do PAYE online for you, you can do that by accessing your <a rel="external" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/bas-gateway/sign-in?continue_url=/business-account?utm_source=Gov&origin=" class="govuk-link">HMRC online services</a> and selecting ‘Manage Account’.</p>

<p>You can also use this service to remove authorisation from your agent if you do not want it to continue after they have submitted your claim(s).</p>

<h3 id="if-youre-putting-100-or-more-employees-on-furlough">If you’re putting 100 or more employees on furlough</h3>

<p>For claim periods starting on or after 1 July, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/download-a-template-if-youre-claiming-for-100-or-more-employees-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">download a template if you’re claiming for 100 or more employees</a> and upload this when you claim.</p>

<p>Using this template will help ensure your claim is processed quickly and successfully. Your template may be rejected if you do not give the information in the right format.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-claim">How to claim</h2>

<p>You’ll need the Government Gateway user ID and password you got when you registered for PAYE online.</p>

<p>If you do not finish your claim in one session, you can save a draft. You must complete your claim within 7 days of starting it. All claims must be submitted no later than 30 November 2020 and you will not be able to add to that claim after 30 November.</p>

<p>If you want to delete a claim in the online service, you must do this within 72 hours of starting it.</p>

<h2 id="after-youve-claimed">After you’ve claimed</h2>

<p>Once you’ve claimed, you’ll get a claim reference number. HMRC will then check that your claim is correct and pay the claim amount by BACs into your bank account within 6 working days.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep a copy of all records for 6 years, including:
    <ul>
      <li>the amount claimed and claim period for each employee</li>
      <li>the claim reference number for your records</li>
      <li>your calculations in case HMRC need more information about your claim</li>
      <li>for employees you flexibly furloughed, usual hours worked including any calculations that were required</li>
      <li>for employees you flexibly furloughed, actual hours worked</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>tell your employees that you  have made a claim and that they  do not need to take any more action</li>
  <li>pay your employee their wages, if you have not already</li>
</ul>

<p>You must pay the full amount you are claiming for your employee’s wages to your employee. You must also pay the associated employee tax and National Insurance contributions to HMRC, even if your company is in administration. If you’re not able to do that, you’ll need to repay the money back to HMRC.</p>

<p>You must also pay to HMRC the employer National Insurance contributions on the full amount that you pay the employee. If you have submitted a claim for the employer National Insurance contributions and pension contributions, then the full amount you claim in respect of these must be paid or you will need to repay the money back to HMRC.</p>

<p>Employers cannot enter into any transaction with the worker which reduces the wages below the amount claimed. This includes any administration charge, fees or other costs in connection with the employment. Where an employee had authorised their employer to make deductions from their salary, these deductions can continue while the employee is furloughed provided that these deductions are not administration charges, fees or other costs in connection with the employment.</p>

<h3 id="when-the-government-ends-the-scheme">When the government ends the scheme</h3>

<p>When the scheme closes on October 31, you must decide to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bring your employees back to work on their normal hours</li>
  <li>reduce your employees’ hours</li>
  <li>terminate their employment (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/staff-redundant" class="govuk-link">normal redundancy rules apply to furloughed employees</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>30 November is the last day that you can submit claims for periods ending on or before 31 October. After this date you will not be able to submit any further claims or add to existing claims.</p>

<h3 id="tax-treatment-of-the-coronavirus-job-retention-grant">Tax Treatment of the Coronavirus Job Retention Grant</h3>

<p>Payments you’ve received under the scheme are to offset the deductible revenue costs of your employees. You must include them as income when you calculate your taxable profits for Income Tax and Corporation Tax purposes.</p>

<p>Businesses can deduct employment costs as normal when calculating taxable profits for Income Tax and Corporation Tax purposes.</p>

<p>Individuals with employees that are not employed as part of a business (such as nannies or other domestic staff) are not taxable on grants received under the scheme. Domestic staff are subject to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions on their wages as normal.</p>

<h2 id="underclaim">If you have not claimed enough</h2>

<p>If you made an error in your claim that has resulted in receiving too little money, you will still need to make sure you pay your employees the correct amount. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/get-help-with-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC</a> on or before 30 November to amend your claim and as you are increasing the amount of your claim, we may need to conduct additional checks. You will not be able to amend your claim to increase the amount you have claimed after 30 November.</p>

<p>30 November is the last day that you can submit claims for periods ending on or before 31 October. After this date you will not be able to submit any further claims or add to existing claims.</p>

<h2 id="contacting-hmrc">Contacting HMRC</h2>

<p>We are receiving very high numbers of calls. Contacting HMRC unnecessarily puts our essential public services at risk during these challenging times.</p>

<p>Do not contact HMRC unless it has been more than 10 working days since you made the claim and you have not received it in that time.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-online">Get help online</h3>
