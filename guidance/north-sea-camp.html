<h2>Book and plan your visit to North Sea Camp</h2>

<h3>Getting to North Sea Camp</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/FGgJJFFsWsw45ETJ7" rel="external">Find North Sea Camp Prison on a map</a></p>

<p>There is a visitor car park just before the entrance to the prison and you can report to the gate lodge on arrival.</p>

<p>To plan your journey by public transport, use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" rel="external">National Rail Enquiries</a>.</p>

<p>The closest railway station is Boston. The prison provides transport to and from the station, which must be booked at the time of booking your visit.</p>

<h3>Entering North Sea Camp</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>The prison has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should be properly dressed at all times (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into the prison. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There is a children’s play area and a cafe where you can buy snacks and drinks. 
Activities are arranged for children visiting prisoners by the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://latcharity.org.uk/family/family-childrens-support/" rel="external">Lincolnshire Action Trust (LAT)</a>.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days taking place.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at North Sea Camp</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at North Sea Camp.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a>
###Phone calls
Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this. Prisoners can call between 7am and 11.45pm.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in North Sea Camp using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at North Sea Camp.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write to a prisoner at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prison number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact North Sea Camp</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in North Sea Camp are given a list of approved items that can be sent to them as gifts. The prisoner needs to apply for the ‘56 day’ parcel. Items can only be sent in 56 days from the day the prisoner arrived at the prison.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact North Sea Camp</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>Family and friends of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.
&nbsp;
For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prison number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Life at North Sea Camp</h2>
<p>North Sea Camp is committed to providing a safe and educational environment where men can learn new skills to help them on release.</p>

<p>As an open prison, its main focus is on resettling the prisoners and getting them used to working in the community. There is a job club and Jobcentre Plus, self-employment classes and paid opportunities to work outside prison.</p>

<h3>Security and safeguarding</h3>
<p>Every person at North Sea Camp has a right to feel safe. The staff are responsible for their safeguarding and welfare at all times.</p>

<p>For further information about what to do when you are worried or concerned about someone in prison <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/pages/category/need-urgent-help?Take=24" rel="external">visit the Prisoners’ Families helpline website</a>.</p>

<p>All safeguarding processes are overseen by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/lsab" rel="external">Lincolnshire Safeguarding Adults Board</a>.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>
<p>When a prisoner first arrives at North Sea Camp, they will be able to contact a family member by phone. This could be quite late in the evening, depending on the time they arrive.</p>

<p>They will speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>
<p>Each person who arrives at North Sea Camp gets an induction that lasts about a week. They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
  <li>offender management processes, including guidance on release on temporary licence (<abbr title="release on temporary licence">ROTL</abbr>), parole and home detention curfew</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone also finds out about the rules, fire safety and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>The North and South units were originally dormitories that have been converted to smaller multi-occupancy rooms. Most have 2 prisoners in each room but have some bigger dormitories, used mostly for the induction of new prisoners.</p>

<p>All accommodation is non-smoking, but there are smoking areas open from 7am to 10pm.</p>

<p>There is disabled shower access on the North unit.</p>

<p>There are 6 single rooms on the South unit that are generally allocated to prisoners who have shown a continuous period of ‘enhanced’ behaviour.</p>

<p>The Harrison and Llewellin temporary units accommodate 60 prisoners each. 40 of the rooms are singles, the other 40 rooms have 2 prisoners in each room.</p>

<p>The Jubilee accommodation is made up of 5 houses, 4 of which are on the outer borders of the prison estate, while the other is closer to the prison. This is to encourage prisoners to engage with their rehabilitation and to incentivise good behaviour.</p>

<p>There is an emphasis on allowing prisoners to develop independent living skills when living in the Jubilee houses. Prisoners have access to fridges and cooking facilities. Nine of the rooms are singles, the other 29 rooms house 2 prisoners. They take part in restorative justice work, attend offending behaviour programmes and engage in activity and employment in preparation for release.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>
<p>Full and part-time education courses cover functional skills qualifications.</p>

<p>All prisoners are encouraged to achieve their level 2 maths and English.</p>

<p>Other courses include IT and personal development, along with workshops in painting, decorating, streetwork, warehousing, health and safety, recycling and bricklaying. NVQs are available in catering.</p>

<p>Prisoners are also offered support with business, Virtual Campus, distance learning, art, employability and resettlement.</p>

<p>Farms and gardens offer courses in horticulture, tractor driving, lawnmower repair, animal care and fork-lift truck driving.</p>

<p>External training opportunities are available as part of the resettlement packages. Weekend courses are also available including food safety, health and safety and IT.</p>

<p>Educational facilities are open all day, evenings and at weekends to allow maximum participation from prisoners and to allow those working in the community to continue their learning.</p>

<p>With a strong emphasis on resettlement in the community, almost a third of prisoners do community or paid work.</p>

<p>There is also drug and alcohol support and counselling.</p>

<p>Courses such as anger management and thinking skills and short-duration programmes are offered in the community to some of the prisoners.</p>

<p>A ‘listener’ scheme operates for men who are considered to be at risk of suicide or self-harm.</p>

<p>Prisoners help with the care and supervision of local special needs groups (adults and children) who come to the prison on a weekly basis.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>
<p>Release on temporary licence (<abbr title="release on temporary licence">ROTL</abbr>) is a large part of life at North Sea Camp. The focus is on prisoners moving from custody to community. Reintegration is achieved through a re-settlement programme, training and unpaid work opportunities.</p>

<p>With the prisoner’s permission, the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://latcharity.org.uk/family/family-childrens-support/" rel="external">Lincolnshire Action Trust (LAT)</a> offers advice and help to families about how <abbr title="release on temporary licence">ROTL</abbr> will work.</p>

<p>The prison works closely with Jobcentre Plus, external training providers and local and national businesses. With the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-services-and-communities-folder/new-futures-networks" rel="external">New Futures Network</a>, work is arranged while on day release.</p>

<p>Our prisoner-led job club advertises its current internal and external opportunities and guides other prisoners through application processes.</p>

<p>The re-settlement programme offers a business course for prisoners hoping to be self employed, covering aspects of finance, planning and business proposals.</p>

<p>It also helps maintain family ties and to complete practical tasks like getting a driving licence and opening a bank account.</p>

<p>The Governor recognises the achievements of the prisoners as they prepare for release. They have an informal ceremony in their final week where they discuss past experiences and hopes for the future.</p>

<h3>Organisations North Sea Camp Prison works with</h3>
