<h3><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/t-levels-next-steps-for-providers">Providers impacted by change to T Level eligibility – published 21 July 2022</a></h3>

<p>The change to T Level eligibility published on 21 July 2022 applies to providers with a Requires Improvement Ofsted rating and new institutions that have not yet been inspected by Ofsted. These providers are no longer limited to delivering only the Construction, Digital, Education and Health and Science T Level routes from September 2023.</p>

<p>If you are a provider in this category and plan to register to deliver T Levels in 2023, you are now also able to offer the following T levels from September 2023:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accounting T Level</li>
  <li>Finance T Level</li>
  <li>Management and Administration T Level</li>
  <li>Design and Development for Engineering and Manufacturing T Level</li>
  <li>Maintenance Installation and Repair for Engineering and Manufacturing T Level</li>
  <li>Manufacturing, Processing and Control T Level</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the T Levels that will be available for delivery for the first time from September 2022.</p>

<p>For providers impacted by the eligibility change, the normal registration process applies for the Construction, Digital, Education and Health and Science T Level routes (explained in the guidance below with a 29 July deadline). To add any of the additional T Levels listed above that you are now eligible to deliver from September 2023, simply email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:TLevel.REGISTRATION@education.gov.uk">TLevel.REGISTRATION@education.gov.uk</a> by 16 September to tell us which of these you plan to offer.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are looking for information about how to register to deliver T Levels from September 2024, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-register-to-deliver-t-levels-from-2024-to-2025-academic-year">how to register to deliver T Levels 2024 to 2025 academic year</a> page.</p>

<p>Registration to deliver T Levels from September 2023 is closed. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-register-to-deliver-t-levels-from-2024-to-2025-academic-year">Registration</a> has opened if you wish to deliver T Levels from 2024 and this closes 24 March 2023.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Guidance for providers who are delivering 16 to 19 study programmes. It outlines how to register an intention to deliver T Levels in 2023 to 2024 academic year and to indicate an interest in delivering a T Level Transition Programme.</p>

<p>The purpose of this guidance is to set out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how providers can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/en/service/2023tlevel-registration" rel="external">register an intention to deliver T Levels in 2023 to 2024 academic year</a>
</li>
  <li>the registration deadlines of:
    <ul>
      <li>30 July 2021 to access implementation planning support</li>
      <li>29 July 2022 to receive up-front delivery funding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the T Levels that will be available for delivery</li>
  <li>what is required from providers wanting to deliver T Levels from 2023 to 2024 academic year</li>
  <li>the support available to providers after they have registered</li>
  <li>that the current T Level approved providers (selected to deliver in 2020, 2021 or 2022) do not need to submit a registration form to extend their T Level delivery for 2023 to 2024 academic year. Their delivery intentions will be collected through the bi-annual T Level data collection</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-action-plan">T Level Action Plan</a> provides important information for providers interested in delivering T Levels from 2023. It provides an update on the progress with T Levels so far and the next stage work. It also provides information on the T Level Transition Programme, and providers will be able to indicate their interest in delivering this as part of their T Level 2023 registration. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-transition-programme-framework-for-delivery-2020-to-2021">T Level Transition Programme framework for delivery</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>2023 will be the fourth year of T Level rollout and this is the point at which we are broadening access to T Levels so that it becomes part of the mainstream offer for all students aged 16, 17 and 18. All providers currently funded to deliver 16 to 19 study programmes will be eligible to deliver some of the available T Levels from September 2023.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Providers may submit their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/en/service/2023tlevel-registration" rel="external">registration form</a> up to the closing date, which is midnight on 29 July 2022. This is the final date to register to receive an up-front revenue funding allocation for T Level delivery for 2023 to 2024 academic year.</p>

<p>Information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-are-funded">how T Levels are funded</a> and the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providers-selected-to-deliver-t-levels">T Level providers</a> (those delivering T Levels and the T Level Transition Programmes from 2020 or planning to deliver from 2021 or 2022) can be found on GOV.UK.</p>
</div>

<h2>Current T Level approved providers</h2>

<p>Current T Level approved providers (selected to deliver in 2020, 2021 or 2022) do not need to submit a registration form to extend their T Level delivery for 2023 to 2024 academic year. These providers will be able to deliver any of the T Levels available from September 2023, subject to meeting the awarding body centre approval requirements and will be able to confirm their delivery intentions to us through established T Level data collection channels.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Providers registering their intentions any time up to 29 July 2022 will receive an acknowledgement and a reference number shortly after submitting their application, confirming that it has been received.</p>

<p>Registrations will be processed at the end of the month in which they were submitted, and we will contact providers during the following month to confirm their T Level delivery and share information. Registrations where a provider has not received an Ofsted inspection, have converted to an academy, or have merged/plan to merge may take slightly longer to process.</p>

<p>Providers who completed their registration to deliver T Levels by 30 July 2021 will be linked to our support team. They will be able to engage in the ongoing T Level qualifications development work with awarding bodies and will receive regular contact from the support team, information and updates.</p>

<p>Those registering to deliver T Levels or indicate their interest in delivering a T Level Transition Programme between August 2021 and 29 July 2022 will not be able to access the same level of support. They will receive all T Level updates, will be able to access information and work with others through our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">support with delivering T Levels</a> web pages.</p>

<p>Providers registering by 31 March 2022 will be asked to complete a data return in May and October 2022 and providers registering between April and 29 July 2022 will be asked to complete a data return in October 2022. There may also be a conversation with the ESFA team about planned student numbers after completing their registration and data returns. The October 2022 data collection will confirm providers’ planned T Level student numbers for 2023 to 2024 academic year to enable a T Level funding allocation to be made in March 2023 as part of the main 16 to 19 funding allocations.</p>

<h2>T Levels available to deliver from 2023 to 2024 academic year</h2>

<p>There are 23 T Levels, across 11 T Level routes that will be available for delivery in 2023 to 2024 academic year.  These are set out in the T Level route table below, along with their associated occupational specialisms.</p>

<p>There will be one or more occupational specialisms available as part of each T Level, which are the specific areas of study that providers and students might focus on after they have completed core learning, each leading students to defined occupational areas. Further information on the content of the T Levels can be found in the  spreadsheet below.</p>

<p>Where T Levels have already been developed and are available, the links are for the actual technical qualifications. For those T Levels that are still in development, the final outline content, from which the qualifications will be developed, is available. The occupational specialism names and content may be subject to change during the development stage. There are recent changes to occupational specialisms that are listed in the spreadsheet below but not yet reflected in the registration form. These relate to name changes or where occupational specialisms have been added or removed from the Legal, Finance and Accounting route and the Engineering and Manufacturing route. We will ask you about which occupational specialisms you plan to offer to students as part of the data collection in October 2022, and at this point the options for each specialism will be up to date.</p>

<h2>Registering your intention to deliver T Levels for 2023 to 2024 academic year</h2>

<p>ESFA funded providers who hold a current 16 to 19 study programme funding agreement or contract, can access the registration form through their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE sign in</a> account. Providers who have a contract to deliver apprenticeships or adult provision only are not eligible to apply.</p>

<p>If providers are not registered with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE sign in</a> they should do this first, and once registered should add the 2023 registration form to their account.</p>

<p>Providers will be required to enter a valid UKPRN, as part of their application. This will be used to partially populate the registration form and to validate whether applicants hold an active Education and Skills Funding Agreement, or contract and receive funding to deliver 16 to 19 study programmes.</p>

<p>Providers wishing to access the full range of support available for implementation planning must have submitted their registration form by midnight on 30 July 2021.</p>

<p>Providers must submit their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/en/service/2023tlevel-registration" rel="external">registration form</a> by midnight on 29 July 2022 to secure up-front funding for their T Level 2023 to 2024 academic delivery. After this date, it will not be possible for providers to be supported or funded up-front to deliver T Levels in 2023 to 2024 academic year. Instead, any unregistered T Level delivery will be funded through the in-year growth process applicable in 2023 to 2024 (subject to affordability), so long as this is correctly coded on the ILR or school census. T Level Transition Programme starts are not funded up-front. Instead, these students will be counted within the usual full-time lagged student numbers for study programmes. Further information is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-are-funded">‘how T Levels are funded’</a> page on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>After you have submitted your registration form, you will receive a notification confirming that it has been submitted.  If for any reason this email confirmation is not received or there are any technical issues when registering, providers should contact us by completing an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">enquiry form</a>, selecting the ‘T Levels’ option and include within the query box ‘T Levels 2023’, your provider name and your UKPRN as a reference.</p>

<p>We will write to the Head of Organisation detailed on our Provider Customer Relationship Management system to confirm the T Level(s) a provider has registered to deliver, and the T Level Transition Programmes they have indicated an interest in delivering.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to discuss and adjust delivery plans should a provider’s Ofsted rating change to either requires improvement or inadequate between the date of submitting their form and 29 July 2022.</p>

<p>If a registered provider’s Ofsted rating changes between submitting their registration form and 29 July 2022, they should contact us by completing an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">enquiry form</a> selecting the ‘T Levels’ option and include within the query box ‘T Levels 2023’, your provider name and your UKPRN as a reference.</p>

<h2>How to complete the registration process</h2>

<h3>Completing the registration form</h3>

<p>Providers wishing to register can access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/en/service/2023tlevel-registration" rel="external">registration form</a> through their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE sign-in</a> account.</p>

<p>We will ask for the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a provider’s published Ofsted rating</li>
  <li>any structural changes, or whether the provider has converted to academy status</li>
  <li>the T Levels a provider plans to deliver in 2023 to 2024 academic year, and planned student numbers
    <ul>
      <li>providers should consider very carefully what it is realistic to deliver if they are registering for T Levels at this point, when it is too late to access the support for planning that has been provided to those registered by July 2021. Plans must be strong and reasonable to attract revenue funding ahead of actual delivery</li>

<h3>Why your Ofsted rating is important</h3>

<p>Providers who have an Ofsted rating of outstanding, or good can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/en/service/2023tlevel-registration" rel="external">register</a> to deliver any of the T Levels available in 2023 to 2024 academic year, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#eel-decline">T Level route table</a>.</p>

<p>Providers with an Ofsted rating of requires improvement, inadequate, or those that are newly established and not yet inspected can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form-sso.education.gov.uk/en/service/2023tlevel-registration" rel="external">register</a> to deliver T Levels in the Digital, Construction, Education and Health and Science T Level routes only for 2023 and may then expand their delivery beyond this from 2024.</p>

<p>We will take the Ofsted grade as at 29 July 2022 for the purposes of determining the T Levels that can only be delivered by providers.</p>

<p>If your Ofsted rating is downgraded to inadequate or requires improvement before 29 July 2022, you will not be able to deliver T Levels that are restricted to good and outstanding providers.</p>

<p>If your Ofsted rating is downgraded between 29 July 2022 and June 2023 please contact us to discuss your plans. We will make decisions on a case by case basis considering what is in the best interests of students and how close you are to delivery. You can do this by completing an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">enquiry form</a> selecting the ‘T Levels’ option and include within the query box ‘T Levels 2023 – Ofsted change’, your provider name and your UKPRN.</p>

<p>If your Ofsted rating improves from requires improvement, or inadequate before 29 July 2022 then you will be eligible to deliver all T Levels in 2023, but please do contact us to discuss this.  You can do this by completing an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">enquiry form</a> selecting the ‘T Levels’ option and include within the query box ‘T Levels 2023’, your provider name and your UKPRN as a reference.</p>

<p>If your Ofsted rating improves from requires improvement, or  inadequate after 29 July 2022 you will only be eligible to deliver T Levels from the Digital, Construction, Education and Health and Science routes for 2023 to 2024 academic year, but will be able to extend your delivery in 2024 to 2025 academic year.</p>

<p>We will collect data on planned delivery in October 2022 to feed into T Level funding allocations for 2023 to 2024 academic year based on the Ofsted position of providers at the end of July 2022.</p>

<h3>Providers that have restructured and merged</h3>

<p>Where providers have restructured or merged and have not yet received a full inspection, we will use the lead provider’s last full Ofsted inspection rating to determine the routes they can be funded to deliver.  Where there is no lead provider, we will combine the ratings of all providers to determine which T Levels a provider can be funded to deliver.</p>

<h3>Academy converters</h3>

<p>Where providers have converted to an academy and have not received a full inspection since conversion, we will use the last full Ofsted inspection rating of the former school/sixth form college to determine the T Levels they can be funded to deliver.</p>

<p>The Ofsted rating recorded in the registration form, should reflect the provider’s position at the time their application is made, and we will start working with providers on the basis of that confirmed rating.</p>

<p>If a provider’s Ofsted rating changes after they have registered, we will look at each case individually and discuss how this might impact on the provider’s delivery planning.</p>

<p>Where a provider’s Ofsted grade declines to requires improvement or inadequate, much will depend on the point that this happens in the planning process and quality improvement work that is necessary.</p>

<p>If a provider’s grade improves after registration and during the planning period and they wish to extend their delivery then the same applies, but there is a cut-off date of 29 July 2022 for taking an improved grade into account. After this, providers will have less than one year to prepare for T Levels delivery, so we would consider this to be too late to change their delivery plans.</p>
