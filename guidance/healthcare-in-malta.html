<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Malta.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-malta" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts</a></p>
</div>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>This information is about living in Malta. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Malta.</a></p>
</div>

<p>If you’re registered for state healthcare in Malta, most services are free. You may have to pay for prescribed medicine.</p>

<p>UK nationals can access the Maltese healthcare system for free in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying social security contributions</li>
  <li>being exempt from paying social security contributions, for example if you’re on benefits or have a low income</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>showing a UK passport if you’re staying for up to one month</li>
  <li>using an RHA Entitlement Card</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with the Entitlement Unit in Malta</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Malta</h2>
<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-malta#visas-and-residency">register as a resident</a> if you’re living in Malta for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>You’re entitled to state healthcare as long as you meet the requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://socialsecurity.gov.mt/en/">Maltese Social Security system</a>.</p>

<p>The Maltese state healthcare system is extensive and covers many services including specialist treatment, inpatient care, prescriptions, antenatal and postnatal care.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Maltese <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>

<p>First, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-malta" class="govuk-link">register as a resident in Malta</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re employed or self-employed, you’ll pay social security contributions in Malta. These entitle you to free state healthcare.</p>

<p>If you’re employed, your employer will pay your national insurance contributions for you. You can get a social security number from the Department of Social Security or from the District Offices.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, you’ll need to pay your social security contributions directly to the <a rel="external" href="https://cfr.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx" class="govuk-link">Commissioner of Inland Revenue</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not <a href="https://www.servizz.gov.mt/en/Pages/Inclusion_-Equality-and-Social-Welfare/Social-Solidarity/Benefits-and-Services/WEB2394/default.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">exempt from paying contributions</a> and do not have an <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a>, you can  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://s2.eessi.gov.mt/how-to-get-a-rha/" rel="external">apply for a Maltese RHA Entitlement Card</a>. This entitles you to free state healthcare in Malta. You will not be covered for everything you’d get if you were paying social security contributions.</p>

<p>You’ll need to show proof that you’re eligible for state healthcare services each time you go to your health centre. This can be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of your last payslip or residence card if you’re employed or self-employed</li>
  <li>your Certificate of Entitlement</li>
  <li>your RHA card</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to register with a GP in Malta. You can make an appointment or go to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://deputyprimeminister.gov.mt/en/phc/Pages/Health-Centres/Overview.aspx" rel="external">health centre</a> nearest to your home.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>If you’re employed, your contributions are usually 10% of your salary before tax. Your employer pays a further 10% contribution.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, your contributions are around 15% of your taxable income.</p>

<p>Most state healthcare services in Malta are free.</p>

<p>Prescribed medicine is free when you’re a hospital inpatient and for 3 days after you’re discharged. After that, you pay for prescriptions. How much you pay depends on the medicine and is set by the Maltese government.</p>

<p>If you have a low income or chronic illness, you may be able to get either a ‘pink form’ or ‘yellow card’. These entitle you to free prescriptions.</p>

<p>Dental care is not usually free. Most dentists have private practices. You can get emergency free dental care at some health centres and state hospitals.</p>

<p>You may have to pay for any treatment not considered necessary.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Malta temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Malta using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Malta</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-malta" class="govuk-link">resident in Malta</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Malta before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Maltese system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Malta on the same basis as a Maltese citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Malta than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>

<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Malta</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 form with the Entitlement Unit in Malta.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Entitlement Unit
<br>St Luke's Hospital
<br>G'Mangia Hill
<br>G'Mangia
<br>Malta
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You’ll need to show the Entitlement Unit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your original S1 form</li>
  <li>your eResidence card</li>
  <li>your passport</li>
  <li>photocopies of the above</li>
</ul>

<p>Once registered, you’ll be issued with a Certificate of Entitlement. Show this each time you see a GP or access healthcare services</p>

<p>Your Certificate of Entitlement shows that you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Maltese citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Malta</h2>
<p>You can use an <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
