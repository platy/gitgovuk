<h2 id="implementation-period">Implementation Period</h2>

<p>The implementation period (<abbr title="Implementation Period">IP</abbr>) will start from EU Exit Day, currently 31 January but can be sooner, and will run until 31 December 2020, during which time the details of the future relationship will be negotiated and information on what you need to do to prepare will be made available here, in due course.</p>

<p>Sign up to our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/email-signup/new?email_signup%5Bfeed%5D=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/veterinary-medicines-directorate.atom" class="govuk-link">email alert</a> notifications to make sure you get the latest information as it becomes available.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The following guide is an expectation of what the Withdrawal Bill will provide during the Implementation Period. This will be confirmed once the Bill is ratified.</p>
</div>

<p>During the <abbr title="Implementation Period">IP</abbr>, EU laws will continue to apply in the UK as before. However, as the UK will be a third country there are some changes, most notably that the UK cannot act as Reference Member State, Rapporteur or 
Co-rapporteur.  Also highlighted here are areas which will remain the same and are worth noting.</p>

<p>The guidance pages on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/veterinary-medicines-directorate" class="govuk-link">www.gov.uk/vmd</a> will be updated on, and current from, EU Exit day.</p>

<p>The legal default at the end of the <abbr title="Implementation Period">IP</abbr> continues to be no-deal if a future relationship cannot be agreed.</p>

<p>The following information is intended for Marketing Authorisation holders (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>) and Veterinary Surgeons.</p>
