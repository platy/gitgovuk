<p><strong>The Green Homes Grant scheme is now closed to new registrations and applications</strong></p>

<p>If you’re already a registered Green Homes Grant installer, you can continue to carry out work under the scheme if your customer has been issued a voucher. You must finish the work at least 7 days before the voucher’s expiry date.</p>
</div>

<p>Homeowners and residential landlords can use a Green Homes Grant voucher towards the cost of installing energy efficient improvements to their home.</p>

<p>Vouchers cover up to two-thirds of the cost of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-green-homes-grant-scheme#what-the-voucher-can-be-used-for">eligible improvements</a>, with a maximum overall government contribution of £5,000. If the household receives certain benefits, the voucher may cover up to 100% of the cost, with a maximum overall government contribution of £10,000.</p>

<p>To carry out work under the scheme, you must remain registered as a Green Homes Grant installer. You must also be certified to install energy efficiency measures under the scheme.</p>

<p>This guidance should be read alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-green-homes-grant-scheme">Green Homes Grant guidance</a> which provides general details about the scheme.</p>

<h2>Certifications needed to carry out the work</h2>

<p>To carry out work under the scheme, you must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered as a certified installer with TrustMark</li>
  <li>certified by a body that has been accredited by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/news/ukas-and-the-green-homes-grant-scheme" rel="external">United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you install energy efficiency measures, you must be certified to install measures against one of the following Publicly Available Specification (<abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr>) standards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 2030:2019</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 2035:2019 (for park homes, high rise buildings and buildings that are both traditionally constructed and protected)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you install low carbon heat measures such as heat pumps, you must be certified with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcscertified.com/installers-manufacturers/becoming-certified" rel="external">Microgeneration Certification Scheme (<abbr title="Microgeneration Certification Scheme">MCS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>If at any point you lose your certification or your TrustMark approval you must notify the scheme administrator.</p>

<h3>Subcontracting</h3>

<p>If you want to subcontract any part of the work involved in installing eligible improvements, this must be carried out in accordance with the relevant <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> or <abbr title="Microgeneration Certification Scheme">MCS</abbr> requirement with regards to subcontracting.</p>

<p>As the primary installer you assume full responsibility for any subcontracted work.</p>

<p>The accreditation and subcontracting requirements and rules are the same across both the regular and low income parts of the scheme.</p>

<h2>Giving a quote</h2>

<p>The price quoted should reflect the total costs of the installation including materials, labour and <abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>. It should be your usual price and not be higher than the price you would have quoted if the installation was not being carried out under the scheme.</p>

<p>If you’re providing a quote for additional work not covered under the scheme, this must be quoted for separately.</p>

<h2>Doing the work</h2>

<p>You must have received confirmation that your registration has been successful before you offer to carry out any work under the scheme.</p>

<p>You can only begin work once the voucher has been issued to the customer. Any work that was started before that date cannot be claimed under the scheme.</p>

<p>You will be required to provide photographic evidence both before starting and after completing improvement works.</p>

<p>The work must be completed and the voucher redeemed by the customer before the expiry date of the voucher. This is usually 3 months from the date it’s issued, but may be shorter.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Customers can request an extension to the validity period of their voucher. Extensions will only be granted in limited circumstances. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-green-homes-grant-scheme">Read the customer guidance for further details.</a></p>
</div>

<h2>After the work is completed</h2>

<p>Once the work is completed, you must give the customer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a dated copy of an invoice showing the supply and installation cost of measures (you must provide one invoice per measure)</li>
  <li>any certification for energy efficiency improvement measures</li>
  <li>any claim of conformity or handover packs (in accordance with the relevant <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>any guarantee documents</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="Microgeneration Certification Scheme">MCS</abbr> certificate, an <abbr title="Microgeneration Certification Scheme">MCS</abbr> compliance certificate and relevant manufacturer instructions (if you have installed a low carbon heating measure)</li>
  <li>details of the Biomass Suppliers List (BSL) including instruction that all fuel used in the boiler should be purchased from the BSL (if you installed a biomass fuelled low carbon heating system)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must ensure that you notify the relevant body of your installations according to the requirements of building regulations within 30 days of completing the work.</p>

<h2>Redeem a voucher</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Access to the Sightline Mobile App has now been turned off. Information, which would have previously been supplied to the scheme through Sightline Mobile, should now be submitted using the process explained below.</p>

<p>You only need to complete this form once.</p>

<h2>Payment</h2>

<p>You can’t ask customers who are eligible for the low-income element of the scheme to provide a deposit unless the quote exceeds the £10,000 cap. Only the amount in excess of £10,000 will be eligible for a deposit.</p>

<p>You must provide the customer with an invoice within 14 days of completing the work. If you have carried out any additional work not covered under the scheme, this must be invoiced separately.</p>

<p>Where a customer contribution is required, the customer contribution is a condition of voucher eligibility. Accepting non-payment, paying this yourself or providing cashback to secure the work will make the voucher invalid.</p>

<h3>Receiving the voucher payment</h3>

<p>The voucher will be processed for payment when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the customer has confirmed that the work is complete</li>
  <li>you have told TrustMark that the work is complete</li>
  <li>the scheme administrator has confirmed that the work meets the voucher conditions</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p>Your work may be selected for an on-site audit. This will need to be carried out before the voucher payment can be processed.</p>
</div>

<p>As the primary installer, you’re responsible for making payment to any subcontractor.</p>
