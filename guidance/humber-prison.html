<p>There is car parking available at the prison with Blue Badge spaces in front of the gate.</p>

<h3>Entering Humber</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Humber has a strict dress code policy stating all visitors should wear smart clothes. That means no vests, no logos, no sports tops, no ripped clothing, no high boots, no steel toe-caps, no low-cut tops, no shorts or short dresses.</p>

<p>Also Humber will not allow entry to people wearing multiple layers, padded coats or jackets, hi-vis jackets or any headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Humber. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. You can leave pushchairs and car seats in the visitors centre at the bottom of the car park.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<p>All visitors must book in and show ID at the visitor centre which is just outside the main prison gate.</p>

<p>It is open at 12.30pm from Monday to Friday, and from 9am on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>It is best to book in at least 30 minutes before the start of your visit.</p>

<p>Under coronavirus safety measures, there will be no toys for children to play with.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are monthly family days at Humber that prisoners can apply for.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Humber</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Humber.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms but they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send and receive emails to someone in Humber using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Humber</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Humber are not allowed gifts.</p>

<p>Men serving 18 months or more can apply for a clothing parcel. If approved, they can normally receive a pair of trainers, t-shirts, a jumper and some jogging bottoms.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Humber</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
