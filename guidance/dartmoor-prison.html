<h2>Book and plan your visit to Dartmoor</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Dartmoor you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-dartmoor">required ID</a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit. Maximum of 3 visitors will be allowed.</p>

<p>Most prisoners in Dartmoor are allowed up to 3 visits per month. You can check this with Dartmoor.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Dartmoor</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

<h3>Help with the cost of your visit</h3>
<p>If you get certain benefits or have an NHS health certificate, you might be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help-with-prison-visits">get help with the costs of your visit</a>, including:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>How to book family and friends visits</h3>
<p>Dartmoor is running a limited visits schedule. Visits are also happening differently than normal, observing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic">strict guidelines, which must be followed</a>.</p>

<p>The maximum visit time is 90 minutes. The number of visitors entering and exiting the establishment simultaneously will be limited, this is to allow for appropriate social distancing. Everyone will get a 90-minute visit within the 2-hour visit session to allow for entry, exit, and cleaning. Visits sessions will be on a rotational wing basis. This is to reduce the risk of a prison wide outbreak and to ensure fairness. You will be informed of the slots available when booking.</p>

<p>You can book your visit by telephone. There is no online booking service available at this time.</p>

<p>You can also register to use the <a class="govuk-link" href="#secure-video-calls">secure video calls</a> service.</p>

<h3>Entering Dartmoor</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Dartmoor has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit at this time.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Dartmoor. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>There is a visitors centre, run by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.choiceshelpsfamilies.org.uk/visitorscentre_dart.html" rel="external">Choices</a>. They can provide you with information and help, you can buy drinks and snacks and there is a play area for children.</p>

<p>The children’s play area is currently not available to use.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<p>Family Days are operated through Choices. They can provide you with information and help, please contact them on 01822 322163 or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dmmanager@choiceshelpsfamilies.org.uk">dmmanager@choiceshelpsfamilies.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Family visits ordinarily take place once per month and there are two types of family visits. Child Centred Visits (CCVs) and Adult Only Visits (AOVs). CCVs are currently held eight times per year and AOVs are held four times per year. At this time family visits have been suspended due to the pandemic, when they re-start the dates for these visits will be displayed in the visits centre, visits hall and on the wings.</p>

<p>All applications to attend these visits must be made by the prisoner. Applications must be made using the Choices family visits application form, these can be found on the wings.</p>

<p>All applications for these visits are subject to security approval.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Dartmoor</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Dartmoor.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their cells so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Dartmoor using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Dartmoor.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prison number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Dartmoor</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>You cannot send gifts and parcels to Dartmoor. Instead you can send money and the prisoner can purchase approved items.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
