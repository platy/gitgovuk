<p>These tools are a collection of activities and assessments to support you as you follow the <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr>. You may request any tool that you want to use and is relevant to your application through the Target Development Profile (<abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr>). The partners will consider the request in the <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr> Roadmap.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Inspections</h2>

<p>The Adaptive Inspections tool is designed to support the over-arching <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr> and enable transformed regulation. It will support the non-clinical, clinical and manufacturing design and development pathway to ensure protection of patients and reliability of results.</p>

<p>Adaptive inspections can be used to progress and support your authorisation applications and post-authorisation patient supply. This will help to make sure that the most promising innovative products are developed in line with the highest quality standards and can be brought to patients both safely and quickly. It will also help prevent unnecessary cost and waste in the development pathway by making sure that all design and technologies are fit for purpose from the start.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>Adaptive inspections provide tailored flexible and pragmatic supervisory and licensing inspections, specific to the Good Practice guidelines and the needs of the product as identified through the <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr>. A risk-based approach to the inspection strategy will be applied, which may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>live-phase inspections for pre-clinical or clinical aspects, ensuring design and technologies are fit for purpose and appropriate manufacturing licences are in place in line with statutory requirements. This could include joint Agency inspections where relevant</li>
  <li>defined pre-authorisation inspections of clinical trials, potentially linked to adaptive design key decision or design implementation points, and/or at end of trial to confirm patient safety and reliability of results</li>
  <li>inspections may link to key data certification timepoints (see Certifications tool) along the pathway to marketing authorisation, including within rolling review as appropriate, enabling innovation</li>
  <li>pre-authorisation inspections to assess the applicantâ€™s ability to comply with post-authorisation pharmacovigilance obligations. These may include activities to identify and characterise new risks associated with the use of the product and activities to minimise important known or potential risks, such as controlled distribution or pregnancy prevention strategies</li>
  <li>post-authorisation inspections to assess compliance with specific licence conditions or routine requirements, such as post-authorisation safety study commitments and risk minimisation measures, providing assurance in support of the earlier approval time-point</li>
</ul>

<p>Patient benefits include assurance that products that come through the pathway are approved based on valid and reliable data, and that the developer has the necessary infrastructure to support risk identification and management.</p>

<h3>Delivery partners</h3>

<p>If you use the Adaptive Inspections tool you will work with experts from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> divisions and centres.</p>

<h3>Related tools</h3>

<p>The Adaptive Inspections tool can be used alongside the Certifications, Continuous Benefit Risk Assessment integrating Real World Evidence (<abbr title="Real World Evidence">RWE</abbr>), Innovative and Flexible Licensing Routes, Novel Methodology and Innovative Clinical Trial Design tools.</p>

<h2>Certifications</h2>

<p>Building on the Agencyâ€™s scientific advice approach, the Certification tool provides developers with an enhanced official regulatory review of packages of Common Technical Document (<abbr title="Common Technical Document">CTD</abbr>) data (including Module 1). The process will provide applicants with specific and actionable feedback on the expectations for marketing authorisation and the regulatory requirements, highlighting potential deficiencies and where there are key issues to address.</p>

<p>This tool is not part of a formal marketing authorisation application but provides expert advice on how â€˜regulatory readyâ€™ a particular part of the development is.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You must confirm in the <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr> which aspects of the <abbr title="Common Technical Document">CTD</abbr> you are interested in having certified. We would expect this to be within Module 1, Module 3, Module 4 or Module 5, not necessarily a full module.</p>

<p>You can apply to have packages of <abbr title="Common Technical Document">CTD</abbr> data assessed by an <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> multi-disciplinary team including licensing, pharmacovigilance and inspectorate colleagues who will review the submission against marketing authorisation requirements and expectations for regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>Packages of <abbr title="Common Technical Document">CTD</abbr> data might include quality, non-clinical or clinical and pharmacovigilance aspects. Early engagement on the acceptability of the submission will provide the developer with the opportunity to make timely changes to their programme in advance of a formal marketing authorisation application.</p>

<p>For biological medicines, such as vaccines, blood products and other immunological biotherapeutics, you will be able to engage early on with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nibsc.org/" rel="external">National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (<abbr title="National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC)">NIBSC</abbr>)</a> scientists. Interactions will facilitate the rapid establishment of the relevant tests and make sure that, where possible, legally mandated batch testing can be performed in parallel to manufacturerâ€™s in-house testing, ensuring no delays in access to these medicines.</p>

<p>Certification may be considered for the whole of one module or a subsection or across modules if agreed. You can request more than one certification over time for different modules.</p>

<p>Following the submission, the team will assess the modules against the regulatory framework and standards. The outcome of the certification will be a letter summarising the regulatory view of the data, the parts that are satisfactory and the major deficiencies if they exist and opportunities for further scientific advice as needed.</p>

<h3>Delivery partners</h3>

<p>If you use the Certifications tool you will work with experts from the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> divisions and centres.</p>

<h3>Related tools</h3>

<p>The Certification tool could be used alongside rolling review in the Innovative and Flexible Licensing tool and Adaptive Inspections tool.</p>

<h2>Continuous Benefit Risk Assessment integrating Real World Evidence</h2>

<p>A proactive approach to data collection and post authorisation vigilance is key in supporting approval of innovative medicines. This tool, co-developed by <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> and <abbr title="Scottish Medicines Consortium">SMC</abbr>, aims to provide guidance that ensures that the agreed approach delivers the right data, filling potential gaps in evidence within the right timeframe.</p>

<p>The purpose of the tool is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>optimise identification, access and timely delivery of decision-relevant data for regulatory and reimbursement bodies</li>
  <li>support use of <abbr title="Real World Evidence">RWE</abbr> and continuous assessment of emerging evidence to monitor safety and efficacy</li>
  <li>ensure a proactive, feasible and sustainable approach to data collection covering both efficacy/effectiveness and safety aligned with key stakeholders</li>
  <li>provide a unique offer which encourages and facilitates the use of <abbr title="Real World Evidence">RWE</abbr> to support the benefit-risk profile</li>
</ul>

<p>Through the tool, <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will provide regulatory science expertise, building on the <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr> to support activities in the Risk Management Plan (<abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr>), offering guidance and assistance around development of an upfront data collection and delivery plan. We will explore with the applicant the options for long-term data collection.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, we will support alignment with key stakeholder requirements including that of Health Technology Assessment bodies, offering scientific advice on study design and assessment of study protocols (for example defining the key objectives, study endpoints, data sources, and feasible delivery timelines). Guidance provided throughout the procedure will allow for prompt study start and data collection. The tool will seek to increase the utility and availability of <abbr title="Real World Evidence">RWE</abbr>, ensuring it is used optimally to support the benefit-risk profile. This will be achieved by offering guidance on possible sources of <abbr title="Real World Evidence">RWE</abbr>, considering options for data linkage and supporting engagement with data providers where possible.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>Products most suitable for the tool would typically be those where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Post-Authorisation Safety (or Efficacy) Study (PASS/ PAES) is likely to be desirable or mandated including those where the product may be subject to conditions of the marketing authorisation</li>
  <li>medicines granted through a conditional marketing authorisation or authorisation under exceptional circumstances</li>
  <li>where an appropriate control group may be lacking or where there may be other uncertainties about the generalisability of the clinical data to real world use in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>If your product is likely to need complex additional risk minimisation strategies, you may also benefit from the advice you can access through the tool.</p>

<p>The process could begin at any point from <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr> roadmap development up to and including submission of your application for marketing authorisation or extension of indication, depending on your particular needs.</p>

<p>Key outputs from the tool could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice to further refine the <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr> roadmap and support development of the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr>, focussing on plans for post-approval evidence requirements, including <abbr title="Real World Evidence">RWE</abbr>.</li>
  <li>provisional agreement of study protocols, in full or as synopses</li>
</ul>

<h3>Delivery partners</h3>

<p><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, Health Technology Assessment and NHS bodies will be important partners in influencing plans for further studies.</p>

<h3>Related tools</h3>

<p>The tool could operate independently of other tools but could work with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Innovative Licensing Routes</li>
  <li>Clinical Practice Research Datalink (<abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr>) Assisted Patient Recruitment</li>
  <li>Adaptive Inspections</li>
  <li>Enhanced Patient Engagement</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clinical Practice Research Datalink (<abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr>) Assisted Patient Recruitment</h2>

<p><abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr> has developed an innovative service to efficiently locate patients across the UK who are potentially eligible for a clinical trial via a centralised search of the <abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr> electronic health records (EHR) database, followed by GP clinical review.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cprd.com/" rel="external"><abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr></a></p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>If you want to make use of this tool you can indicate that in the <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr>. Representatives from <abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr> will advise you on the feasibility of using this approach and provide you with an outline of the process.</p>

<p>Subsequent discussions would be held to undertake a detailed assessment of potential patient numbers, geographical distribution of potential trial subjects, to assess the operational feasibility of using the tool and to outline estimated costs.</p>

<p>Delivery of the service would be undertaken with the customer or an agent with responsibility for clinical trial recruitment, and in collaboration with the sponsor.</p>

<h3>Delivery partners</h3>

<p>The whole process is centrally managed by <abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr>. The service will be delivered directly by <abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr> in collaboration with the sponsor.</p>

<h3>Related tools</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr> Assisted Patient Recruitment tool could be used with the Continuous Benefit Risk Assessment integrating <abbr title="Real World Evidence">RWE</abbr> tool to manage any longer term follow up of enrolled patients.</p>

<h2>Enhanced patient engagement</h2>

<p>This tool is a key component of <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>â€™s broader commitment to be a patient and public-focused regulator â€“ putting patients and the public at the centre of our regulatory decision-making. It has been co-developed by <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> and <abbr title="Scottish Medicines Consortium">SMC</abbr> to provide opportunities throughout the <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr> for companies to consider the patientâ€™s experience and voice in a meaningful way in how they develop their innovative products.</p>

<p>The patient engagement tool will consider the patientâ€™s voice and experience from clinical design, scientific advice and all the way through to the generation of meaningful real-world data post-licensing and pharmacovigilance. It will give patients the opportunity to influence the development of products that will benefit them.</p>

<p>With a wealth of experience we will be able to advise on identifying stakeholders who may not be active members of patient groups, as well as under-represented populations and diverse communities. This experience includes working with patient representatives on our Patient Group Consultative Forum (which currently has over 100 participants who are either representatives of patient groups/networks and research charities or individual patients),
We will also be able to provide support on how best to integrate patient-reported outcome measures, a critical component to assess the benefits patients have gained from the product.</p>

<p>This tool has been developed in consultation with patients.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>We will ask if you have already engaged with patients in developing the product and explore what additional approaches you have identified for patient engagement. We will also seek your views on what you would like to gain from new or further patient involvement.</p>

<p>In line with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>â€™s development of the broader Patient and Public Engagement and Involvement Strategy, you will also be asked to consider how you propose to engage and involve not just patients but others such as carers and a patientâ€™s family. Our offer will include patient engagement facilitation across an extensive range of conditions, diseases, areas, issues and clinical needs, including rare diseases.</p>

<p>Post-product authorisation, you will be given the opportunity to access support and advice on patient information and evaluations including real world data, and advice on how post-market surveillance can best meet the needs of patients.</p>

<h3>Delivery partners</h3>
<p>This tool is delivered by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>, the Scottish Medicines Consortium, and potentially in collaboration with other organisations such as the Health Research Authority and NHS England and NHS Improvement</p>

<h3>Related tools</h3>
<p>This tool can be used alongside Innovative licensing routes, <abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr> assisted patient recruitment, Novel methodology and Innovative Clinical Trial Design, Continuous Benefit: Risk Assessment integrating Real-World Evidence.</p>

<h2>Innovative and Flexible Licensing Routes</h2>

<p>The tool is intended to provide support and guidance in the choice of routes for products in the <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr>. Some of these routes may be available as options to companies with products outside of <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Innovative and Flexible Licensing Routes tool can provide expedited timelines for review, pragmatic approaches to evidence requirements and international options where appropriate and available.</p>

<p>Regulatory licensing flexibilities can be used to expedite the approval process once a product or new indication has sufficient data for regulatory review. Independent laboratory testing can also support authorisations based on reduced data packages through the generation, post-licensure, of data supporting batch-to-batch consistency.</p>

<p>The routes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accelerated assessment</li>
  <li>Rolling review</li>
  <li>Approval with conditions</li>
  <li>Conditional Marketing Authorisations</li>
  <li>Approval under exceptional circumstances</li>
  <li>Project Orbis</li>
  <li>Access Consortium</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accelerated Assessment</h3>

<p>An accelerated assessment procedure will reach opinion on approvability of a marketing authorisation application within 150 days of submission of a valid application. This option is available for good quality marketing authorisation applications for both new and existing active substances.</p>

<p>Eligibility will also include those applications seeking an orphan MA approval in Great Britain and those submitted for conditional and full marketing authorisations as well as those submitted for approval under exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h3>Rolling Review</h3>

<p>The Rolling Review is a new route for marketing authorisation application intended to enhance development of novel medicines. It does this by offering ongoing regulatory input and feedback. The process is envisaged as a phased, modular, iterative approach to evaluation of marketing authorisation applications.</p>

<p>The quality, non-clinical and clinical parts may be submitted singly or in combinations depending on the individual circumstances as data becomes available. It is expected that each module will be near completion to avoid multiple iterations of assessment of the same module. Each assessment phase will progress independently permitting early identification of issues.</p>

<p>Each assessment cycle with points of clarification raised will offer the applicant the opportunity and time for a comprehensive update of the modules prior to final submission. The final phase will involve submission of a complete application including the remaining module together with updated versions of the modules evaluated previously.</p>

<h3>Approval with Conditions</h3>
<p>Conditions are obligations that are imposed at the time that the marketing authorisation is granted. Conditions include PASS/ PAES that can be used to provide reassurance that gaps in the evidence generation will be filled appropriately.</p>

<h3>Conditional Marketing Authorisation</h3>

<p>In order to meet unmet medical needs of patients and in the interest of public health, it may be possible to grant marketing authorisations on the basis of less complete data than is normally required. In such cases, the granting of a marketing authorisation is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually.</p>

<p>These medicines are for the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases, medicinal products to be used in emergency situations, in response to public threats and medicinal products for rare diseases. Conditional marketing authorisation will allow medicines to reach patients with unmet medical needs earlier than might otherwise be the case and will ensure that additional data on a product are generated, submitted, assessed and acted upon.</p>

<h3>Approval under exceptional circumstances</h3>

<p>For licensing under exceptional circumstances, the applicant must demonstrate that they are unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use. This may be because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence or</li>
  <li>in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided or</li>
  <li>it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information</li>
</ul>

<p>Under these circumstances an authorisation may be granted with a reduced clinical data package than would ordinarily be required.</p>

<h3>Project Orbis</h3>

<p>Project Orbis is an initiative of the Food and Drug Administration (<abbr title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>) Oncology Center of Excellence (<abbr title="Oncology Center of Excellence">OCE</abbr>) that provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners including the UK.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-on-project-orbis">Project Orbis</a></p>

<h3>Access Consortium</h3>

<p>The Access Consortium is a collaborative initiative of medium-sized regulatory authorities between Australiaâ€™s Therapeutic Goods Administration (<abbr title="Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)">TGA</abbr>), Health Canada (<abbr title="Health Canada (HC)">HC</abbr>), Singaporeâ€™s Health Sciences Authority (HSA), the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic) of Switzerland and <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. The purpose of the consortium is to build synergies and share knowledge amongst the regulatory authorities thereby enhancing the efficiency of regulatory systems.</p>

<p>Find out more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/access-consortium">Access Consortium</a></p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr> will recommend the most suitable routes to market based on the product and patient population to treat in the context of the ongoing development programme.</p>

<p>Regulatory licensing flexibilities can be used to expedite the approval process once a product or new indication has sufficient data for regulatory review. Independent laboratory testing can also support authorisations based on reduced data packages through the generation, post-licensure, of data supporting batch-to-batch consistency.</p>

<p>Early engagement with <abbr title="National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC)">NIBSC</abbr> will enable the rapid establishment of the relevant tests to make sure that, where possible, legally mandated batch testing can be performed in parallel to manufacturerâ€™s in-house testing, ensuring no delays in access to these medicines.</p>

<p>The Certification tool is relevant to Rolling review, as is the Continuous benefit risk assessment tool for approval with conditions.</p>

<h2>Novel methodology and innovative clinical trial design</h2>

<p>The Novel Methodology and Innovative Clinical Trial Design tool, co-developed by <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> and <abbr title="Scottish Medicines Consortium">SMC</abbr>, is designed to establish a system and culture that is receptive and supportive of novel methodologies in both the clinical and pre-clinical space to develop new medicines or new indications. This includes innovative clinical trial designs, manufacturing, and endpoint development. We will also demonstrate that innovative methodologies are acceptable to all stakeholders, for example by issuing an opinion on the proposed methodology or technology.</p>

<p>The tool has the potential to significantly accelerate development and bring safe, effective medicines to patients faster, balancing the risks and benefits of any novel approaches, with a strong patient focus.</p>

<p>Novel trial designs with virtual and decentralised elements will increase patient-centricity in trials and reduce the burden of taking part, improving recruitment and retention. Qualification and multi-stakeholder regulatory acceptance of novel methodologies will de-risk and reduce the costs of development. The tool will encourage and facilitate the proactive use of novel trial designs for evidence generation â€“ including master protocols â€“ to ensure a flexible regulatory approach that can react to emerging data with a focussed, efficient use of resources.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>According to the individual requirements of the applicant, key outputs from the tool include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>securing multi-stakeholder agreement for novel and innovative approaches to evidence generation</li>
  <li>qualification of the new methodologies and support via (joint) scientific advice procedures (e.g. with <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>) offered during the <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr>, including targeted inspections of novel technologies</li>
  <li>guideline documents on topics of interest</li>
  <li>encouragement and facilitation of the use of novel trial designs, including master protocols, to ensure a flexible regulatory approach that can react to emerging data with a focussed use of resources</li>
  <li>regulatory assurance on the requirements and acceptability of virtual, AI and decentralised elements in trial conduct</li>
  <li>regulatory assurance on new e-systems technologies that may be used to support any such novel trial designs</li>
</ul>

<p>You should expect regulatory assurance on the requirements and acceptability of, for example, use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), virtual and decentralised elements in trial conduct, and e-systems technologies used to support such novel trial designs. Developers will also see use of new approaches for qualification of new methodologies, technologies, use of modelling and simulation, and novel endpoints.</p>

<h3>Delivery partners</h3>

<p>This tool can be used with partners such as <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> and the <abbr title="Scottish Medicines Consortium">SMC</abbr> so that implications of novel trial designs for Health Technology Assessment, can be prospectively addressed. The tools can also be used with other health research system partners such as the Health Research Authority (<abbr title="Health Research Authority">HRA</abbr>) and the National Institute of Health Research (<abbr title="National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)">NIHR</abbr>) to provide reassurance that innovative clinical trial proposals are deliverable.</p>

<h3>Related tools</h3>

<h2>Optimising the Market Access Approach - <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr> HTA Access Tool</h2>

<p>This tool aims to promote understanding of the market access approaches that will optimise the route to patient access.</p>

<p>Unpacking market access challenges and addressing these upfront through early engagement with system stakeholders from England, Scotland and Wales is a key enabler for achieving timely patient access.</p>

<p>This tool, which is delivered by the <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> Office for Market Access (OMA) in collaboration with the Scottish Medicines Consortium (<abbr title="Scottish Medicines Consortium">SMC</abbr>) and All Wales Therapeutics and Toxicology Centre (AWTTC), aims to provide a joined-up view from system stakeholders in England, Scotland and Wales on themes such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where the new technology may potentially fit in the care pathway in order to contextualise the value proposition. This is particularly important in situations where the current care pathway is complex or undefined, or in situations where the clinical trial was not conducted in the UK.</li>
  <li>Service delivery implications of introducing the technology into the NHS, including any commissioning considerations, testing requirements, infrastructural changes, and other implementation activities necessary to facilitate the use of the technology once it receives a positive reimbursement decision.</li>
  <li>High level HTA challenges. This could include helping you to navigate the different HTA routes and understanding the implications of the processes and methods for the technology<em>. It is also an opportunity to understand how to best engage with the HTA agencies and to optimise your HTA submission strategy. (</em>In-depth technical questions should be addressed via <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> Scientific Advice).</li>
  <li>Clarification on how processes will apply in practice. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve rapidly, it can be difficult to navigate current and new processes / initiatives and what these could mean for your technology in practice.</li>
  <li>Commercial options and suitability of approaches to support your value proposition and minimise the financial impact on the NHS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Engaging early in the planning process means that feedback from system stakeholders from England, Scotland and Wales can be built into your ongoing market access strategy. Acting on this feedback will help you to develop the right approaches to optimise the route to patient access.</p>

<p>This tool is particularly useful for products that need careful management into the system. It is most suitable for products that may involve complex HTA and commercial challenges, radical changes to an established care pathway, and significant changes to service delivery, infrastructure, training and workforce. The tool is not a mechanism for making HTA routing decisions or challenging existing decisions made by the guidance programmes.</p>

<p>This is a not-for-profit service - a fee is charged to cover our costs.</p>

<h3>How it works?</h3>

<p>Market access challenges are systematically â€˜unpackedâ€™ through preparatory discussions to understand your needs and the market access insights you are looking for.</p>

<p>We develop the scope of the meeting and work with you to finalise the structure, content, attendance, and logistics.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>, <abbr title="Scottish Medicines Consortium">SMC</abbr>, &amp; AWTTC identify and bring together the most appropriate people in the healthcare systems in England, Scotland and Wales for you to engage with to gain insight for your ongoing market access planning.</p>

<p>Engagement meetings are facilitated and conducted in a safe harbour environment. This ensures confidential, free-flowing, peer-to-peer discussions, which can act as the basis for ongoing engagement with system stakeholders.</p>

<p>You will benefit from signed confidentiality agreements (for people not already covered by their system contracts), sharing of relevant declarations of interests for those involved, and assurance that discussions are non-attributable, non-binding and non-transmissible.</p>

<p>We agree the fee with you and the stakeholders. To make invoicing and payment as easy as possible, you pay the fee to <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> OMA and we make sure that all stakeholders are paid.</p>

<p>This tool is not part of formal HTA guidance processes. It provides expert feedback to support development of the optimal market access approach.</p>

<h2>Rapid Clinical Trial Dossier Pre-Assessment</h2>

<p>The Rapid Clinical Trial Dossier Pre-Assessment service provides sponsors of clinical trials with expert feedback from <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> clinical trial unit assessors on their clinical trial authorisation (<abbr title="clinical trial authorisation">CTA</abbr>) application dossier before it is formally submitted.</p>

<p>The tool will help to reduce the chance of a â€˜Grounds for Non-acceptanceâ€™ being issued for the trial following official submission and therefore de-risk development. This will also facilitate a quicker trial set-up and development.</p>

<p>This is an optional tool for trial sponsors with an Innovation Passport and agreed <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr>. This tool should be used when documentation is in an advanced stage.</p>

<p>Trials for products falling under the â€˜higher riskâ€™ category that require review by the Commission on Human Medicines (<abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr>) would still be eligible, but the final authorisation of the study would be dependent on <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> meeting timelines.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You can submit draft clinical, quality and/or non-clinical documentation for pre-assessment. 
<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will evaluate the data and documentation, provide rapid feedback and identify any potential issues to be rectified prior to formal submission. An informal scientific advice meeting will be held with the sponsor so that any questions or required clarifications can be addressed swiftly.</p>

<p>An iterative approach can be taken, and for the tool to maximise its benefits, it is essential that trial sponsors also respond to any feedback in an expedited manner.</p>

<h3>Delivery partners</h3>

<p>The tool will be delivered by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Clinical Trials Unit. Where appropriate additional input may be obtained from the <abbr title="Health Research Authority">HRA</abbr> to reduce duplication of review of common documentation.</p>

<h3>Related tools</h3>

<p>The tool may have interdependencies with the Novel methodology and Innovative Clinical Trial Design tool.</p>

<h2>Forthcoming tools</h2>

<p>The following tools are currently being developed and will be added to the <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr> toolkit during 2021.</p>

<h4>Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (<abbr title="Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product">ATMP</abbr>) Centre Accreditation</h4>
<p><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> accreditation of centres with specific expertise in <abbr title="Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product">ATMP</abbr> development to provide assurance that trials and/or manufacture conducted by these centres are as safe as possible and meet an <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> accredited standard, providing patient confidence in their regulation. Organisations in the scheme would exceed the basic GxP regulatory standards by having additional standardised procedures and a proven track record in this field, ensuring high-quality data, to facilitate regulatory decision making and ensure the highest standards for protection of patients.</p>

<h4>Coordinated approval of research involving investigation of both a medicine and medical device</h4>
<p>Combined assessment of clinical trials that involve both an investigational medicine and an investigational medical device. Looking to optimise the regulatory pathway for research for combined medicines and medical devices.</p>

<p>Combined in vitro diagnostic (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic">IVD</abbr>) and investigational medicinal product development:
Combined assessment of clinical trials where there is an investigational medicine and <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic">IVD</abbr> such as. a companion diagnostic. This is to optimise and where necessary adapt the clinical trial regulatory pathway for research that requires combinations of medicines and in vitro diagnostics.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr> Control Groups</h4>
<p>Providing access to <abbr title="Clinical Practice Research Datalink">CPRD</abbr> primary care real world data to enable the use of real-world data virtual control arms drawn from relevant and high-quality real-world data as comparators. Uses and applications of virtual control groups are currently being assessed but may be of potential use as natural disease course or standard of care comparators. They may have a specific role in distinguishing treatment effects from other factors in the context of a single arm trials.</p>

<h4>Development of quality standards</h4>
<p>Using <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>â€™s existing quality standards setting functions of the British Pharmacopoeia and <abbr title="National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC)">NIBSC</abbr> to identify and develop standards through the <abbr title="Target Development Profile">TDP</abbr> process that would support the assurance of product quality and facilitating the assessment of the medicine.</p>
