<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> is introducing certain new routes of assessment for evaluation of marketing authorisation applications. They include targeted assessment, accelerated assessment and a rolling review.</p>

<h2 id="targeted-assessment-ta-process">Targeted assessment (<abbr title="Targeted Assessment">TA</abbr>) process</h2>

<p>The “Targeted Assessment (<abbr title="Targeted Assessment">TA</abbr>)” process is intended to support the timely availability of new medicines for patients in the UK. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will evaluate the marketing authorisation application together with the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (<abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr>) assessment reports submitted by the applicants, and will reach its opinion on approvability within 67 days of submission of a valid application to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>This section provides guidance on the procedural aspects for the targeted assessment process.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility-for-ta">Eligibility for <abbr title="Targeted Assessment">TA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Targeted Assessment">TA</abbr> route is available for products containing new active substances or biosimilar molecules that wish to obtain a marketing authorisation in the UK. These products will also have to have received a positive scientific opinion from the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> in the centralised authorisation procedure in accordance with regulation 58 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, as amended by the Human Medicines (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019.</p>

<p>While applications can be accepted after the approval of an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> marketing authorisation, the intention of the scheme is based on submission of the application to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> immediately following the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion.
<abbr title="Targeted Assessment">TA</abbr> is also applicable to those products that are seeking orphan status, conditional marketing authorisation or marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>There is a separate process for applications in transition on exit-day (inflight applications). <abbr title="Targeted Assessment">TA</abbr> is intended for applications where UK was not involved in the discussions at <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr>.</p>

<p>There is a fee payable as applicable. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees/current-mhra-fees">See our guidance on fees for further details</a>.</p>

<h3 id="submission-of-applications-for-ta">Submission of applications for <abbr title="Targeted Assessment">TA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The applicant should submit the same dossier (<abbr title="Common Technical Document">CTD</abbr> modules) as that submitted to European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the centralised procedure together with the sequential assessment reports from <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> from day 120, through to the final day 210 opinion. The day 210 opinion does not refer to the <abbr title="European Public Assessment Report">EPAR</abbr> which is generated several weeks later.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure submission of all assessment reports including questions raised by <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> and the responses. Omission of <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> reports may render the application ineligible for targeted assessment.</p>

<p>The short assessment timetable including consultation with Commission on Human Medicines (<abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr>) and its expert advisory groups requires specific submission dates for receipt of applications.</p>

<p>The time window for submission of the documentation (the dossier and available <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> reports) will begin after day 180 of the centralised procedure. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will publish a set of submission dates to facilitate planning submissions.</p>

<p>The application will be valid for assessment to start when the day 210 <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion is provided to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. In order to achieve the timelines the applicant must ensure that the day 210 opinion is submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> within 3 days.</p>

<p>A pre-submission meeting with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> in advance to facilitate planning is encouraged, but is not mandatory. Pre-submission meetings offer the opportunity to enhance joined up work with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>) Health Technology Assessment (<abbr title="Health Technology Assessment">HTA</abbr>) evaluation process.</p>

<h3 id="validation-of-an-application-for-ta">Validation of an application for <abbr title="Targeted Assessment">TA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The eligible applications that have progressed through the centralised procedure by the EMA will be deemed valid on submission to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will endeavour to complete all validation steps after submission to ensure that all sequences are made available on the portal in order to progress to targeted assessment. The clock for <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> assessment will start as soon as day 210 <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion is provided. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-submissions-to-the-mhra-in-a-no-deal-scenario">See our guidance on making submissions to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> through the portal in a no-deal scenario</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence of a check of compliance with a Paediatric Investigation plan agreed by <abbr title="European Medicines Agency Paediatric Committee">EMA/PDCO</abbr> (Paediatric Committee) where appropriate should be provided.</p>

<p>Applications that refer to an Active Substance Master File (<abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMFs</abbr>) should ensure that the file has already been submitted to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> or included in the submission. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/handling-of-active-substance-master-files-and-certificates-of-suitability-in-the-event-of-no-deal">We recently published updated guidance on how to handle <abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMFs</abbr> if the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="assessment-and-expert-advice">Assessment and expert advice</h3>

<p>The assessment process clock will begin on submission of a valid application. The multidisciplinary assessment teams in the Licencing Division of <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will carry out the assessment of the application informed by the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> deliberations as detailed in sequential assessment reports (day 120 through-to day 210 opinion).</p>

<p>The teams will collaborate with the Vigilance and Risk Management Division regarding assessment of the Risk Management Plan (<abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr>). Risk management issues will be addressed within this timeframe, and the day 210 <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> decision that reflects Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (<abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr>) discussions will provide the basis for the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr> activities in the UK.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will consult <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> for advice during evaluation of all <abbr title="Targeted Assessment">TA</abbr>. The <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> meeting dates will be published on the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> website. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> may additionally wish to seek advice / input from therapy area experts (specialty Expert Advisory Groups).</p>

<p>The targeted assessment will operate to a 67-day cycle, with the <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> consultation and provisional decision madeby 6 -weeks (day 42) after clock start. Any UK specific points for clarification relating to the application and the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr> will be raised during assessment and expected to be finalised by the time of grant of UK marketing authorisation. A clock-stop is not envisaged.</p>

<p>In the event <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> differ in their conclusions from the <abbr title="Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use">CHMP</abbr> opinion as regards the approvability of the application on the basis of serious risk to public health in the UK, a request for further information will be sought from the applicant and the timeline will revert to a day 150 timetable. See <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-1/com_2006_133/com_2006_133_en.pdf">link for definition of serious risk to public health</a>.</p>

<p>The process will then follow the standard appeal processes for national applications with a clock stop to facilitate responses.</p>

<h3 id="publications">Publications</h3>

<p>Conclusion of the targeted assessment will lead to publication of a UK-Public Assessment Report (<abbr title="Public Assessment Report">PAR</abbr>) for the product.</p>

<h2 id="accelerated-assessment-pathway">Accelerated Assessment pathway</h2>

<p>The ‘Accelerated Assessment’ process is aimed at enhancing the availability of novel medicines for patients in the UK. Under this scheme, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will evaluate the marketing authorisation application and will reach its opinion on approvability within 150 days of submission of a valid application.</p>

<p>This section provides guidance on the procedural aspects for the accelerated assessment process.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility-for-accelerated-assessment">Eligibility for Accelerated Assessment</h3>

<p>The Accelerated Assessment option is available for all products containing new active substances, including biologicals for whom the applicants wish to obtain a marketing authorisation in the UK. This is as per regulation 58 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, as amended by the Human Medicines (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019. The scheme is based on submission of an independent standalone application to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>There is a fee payable as applicable. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees/current-mhra-fees">Please see our section on Fees for further details</a>.</p>

<p>The Accelerated Assessment route can be used for products that are seeking orphan status, or a conditional marketing authorisation or products fulfilling the criteria for exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-apply-for-accelerated-assessment">How to apply for Accelerated Assessment</h3>

<p>All applicants interested in seeking Accelerated Assessment should contact the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> (designated coordinator) well in advance of the intended date of submission. The letter requesting Accelerated Assessment should include the intended date of submission of the dossier.</p>

<p>The applicants should submit a valid, full application to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> for evaluation. The accompanying cover letter should detail the intention to seek orphan status or <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> under exceptional circumstances as applicable. Separate guidance will be published on criteria for orphan marketing authorisations, those considered under exceptional circumstances and conditional marketing authorisations.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will operate a ‘fixed submission date’ system to facilitate consultation with the <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> and the dates of <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> meeting. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will publish a set of dates to facilitate planning the submissions and coordinating with appropriate meeting dates of <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr>.</p>

<p>A pre-submission meeting with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> assessment teams is encouraged. At the meeting the company may present their intentions, a short summary of the dossier, verify the new active substance status and raise any special issues  such as requests for consideration for conditional <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> or <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> under exceptional circumstances. Pre-submission meetings offer opportunity to enhance joined up work with <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> <abbr title="Health Technology Assessment">HTA</abbr> evaluation process.</p>

<h3 id="validation-of-applications-for-accelerated-assessment">Validation of applications for Accelerated Assessment</h3>

<p>Applications should be submitted through the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> portal. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees/current-mhra-fees">See our separate guidance on how to make submissions to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> through the portal in a no-deal scenario</a>.</p>

<p>A valid application/dossier for Accelerated Assessment should include common technical modules (<abbr title="Common Technical Document">CTD</abbr> modules 2-5), a UK specific <abbr title="Common Technical Document">CTD</abbr> module-1, and an appropriate Risk Management Plan. Appropriate justification and compliance with paediatric requirements and investigation plans should be included.</p>

<p>Compliance with the Paediatric Investigation Plans will be performed as part of the validation. To prevent delays at the time of validation, the applicants are encouraged when possible to request a compliance check by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> at least one month prior to the planned submission of a regulatory application.</p>

<p>Applications that refer to an <abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMFs</abbr> should ensure that the file has already been submitted to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> or included in the submission. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/handling-of-active-substance-master-files-and-certificates-of-suitability-in-the-event-of-no-deal">See our recently published guidance on how to handle <abbr title="Active Substance Master File">ASMFs</abbr> if the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will endeavour to complete all technical validation steps within a specified number of days after submission and will publish the timelines prior to commencement of the scheme. The assessment clock will begin after validation of the application.</p>

<h3 id="accelerated-assessment-process-and-expert-advice">Accelerated assessment process and expert advice</h3>

<p>The multidisciplinary assessment teams in the licencing division of <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will carry out the assessment of the application collaborating with Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines assessors for evaluation of the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr>. Consultation with the Devices division will be necessary if a companion diagnostic device is required for safe and effective use of the medicinal product.</p>

<p>The assessment process includes consultation with the <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> on fixed dates each month. The submission slots will be linked to the dates of <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> meeting. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> may additionally wish to seek advice/input from therapy area experts (specialty expert groups) during the assessment process.</p>

<p>The assessment process will run in two phases totalling 150 days with an intervening clock-off period between phase I and phase II. Assessment phase I including <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> consultation will be completed 80 days after clock start. Concerns arising from initial assessment will be raised with the applicant and should be addressed in the clock off period of 90 days. Phase II assessment will begin on receipt of the applicant’s responses. Assessment in phase-I will also address eligibility for grant of orphan status or a conditional <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Based on the assessment, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will provide an opinion on approvability of the product by day 150, and if positive, will grant the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="appealing-a-decision-to-refuse">Appealing a decision to refuse</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> refuse to grant the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> based on concerns noted, there is an opportunity for the applicant to appeal the decision to <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr>. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> decision letter will detail the appeal process and timelines.</p>

<p>The orphan status will be determined at the time of <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr> grant. If orphan status is not agreed and company wish to appeal this decision, the grant of a marketing authorisation will only be possible when the appeal process is completed.</p>

<h3 id="publication">Publication</h3>

<p>Conclusion of the accelerated assessment will lead to publication of UK-Public Assessment Report for the product.</p>

<h2 id="guidance-on-the-rolling-review-route">Guidance on the Rolling Review route</h2>

<p>The Rolling Review is a new route for marketing authorisation applications intended to enhance development of novel medicines. It does this by offering on-going regulatory input and feedback enabling the applicants to ‘get it right first time’ and reduce attrition due to avoidable regulatory pitfalls.</p>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>
<p>Applications for any new active substances including biological products that wish to obtain a marketing authorisation in the UK based on submission of a ‘full dossier’ to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> are eligible for a rolling review. Similar biological applications (biosimilar products) are also eligible for rolling review. A fee is payable for the evaluation as applicable.</p>

<h3 id="process-and-sequence">Process and sequence</h3>
<p>The process is envisaged as a phased, modular, iterative approach to evaluation of marketing authorisation applications. The details are currently being developed and some early proposals are presented below.
The quality, non-clinical and clinical parts may be submitted singly or in combinations depending on the individual circumstances as data becomes available. It is expected that each module will be near completion to avoid multiple iterations of assessment of the same module.</p>

<p>Each assessment phase will progress independently permitting early identification of issues. Each assessment cycle with points of clarification raised will offer the applicant the opportunity and time for a comprehensive update of the modules prior to final submission.</p>

<p>The final phase will involve submission of a complete application including the remaining module together with updated versions of the modules evaluated previously. Technical validation of the full application will be undertaken prior to commencing the assessment.</p>

<p>As with targeted and accelerated assessments, compliance with paediatric requirements are expected to be addressed prior to the final phase. The final assessment is expected to be a single phase with the grant (or refusal in case of unresolved concerns) of the marketing authorisation. The <abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr> will also be part of the final evaluations. Each phase of assessment (for quality, non-clinical and clinical modules) will attract a fee and further information will be provided in advance of the launch of the scheme.</p>

<p>Enhanced regulatory interaction and advice will be available during the rolling review process supporting the development process and reducing the risk of failure at the final stage.</p>

<h3 id="expert-input">Expert input</h3>
<p>Consultation with expert advisory groups is anticipated at each stage and with <abbr title="Commission on Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> and therapy areas experts (Specialty EAGs) prior to grant of full <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation">MA</abbr>. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will publish further information on the details of the scheme in due course.</p>
