<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Luxembourg.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-luxembourg">Sign up for email alerts</a></p>
</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>This information is about living in Luxembourg. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Luxembourg</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>State healthcare in Luxembourg is not completely free. Healthcare costs are covered by both the state and through patient contributions. These are known as co-payments.</p>

<p>Everyone must have health insurance in Luxembourg. If you live or work there, you need to register with a health insurance fund to get state medical care.</p>

<p>You may have to pay upfront for some treatment. Your health insurance fund will repay you for 80% to 100% of the costs later.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Luxembourg healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying social insurance contributions to a health insurance fund</li>
  <li>private health insurance</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">S1 form</a> with one of the insurance funds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Luxembourg</h2>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-luxembourg#visas-and-residency" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> if you’re living in Luxembourg.</p>

<p>If you’re employed or self-employed in Luxembourg, you must pay social security contributions to cover your health insurance.</p>

<p>There are 4 Luxembourg health insurance funds. The biggest fund is CNS.</p>

<p>The fund you pay into depends on your job. The Centre Commun de la Sécurité Sociale (<abbr title="Centre Commun de la Sécurité Sociale">CCSS</abbr>) will ensure that you’re paying into the right one.</p>

<p>If you’re resident but not working, you should take out voluntary optional health insurance with CNS. This costs around 117 euros a month.</p>

<p>You can add your dependants to your insurance plan.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="http://www.medecins-generalistes.lu/" class="govuk-link">choose any GP</a> (website in French) or a paediatrician for children. Your GP is usually your first point of contact for medical care, however you do not need a referral to see a specialist.</p>

<p>If you’re a resident and unemployed, you can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/sante-social/action-sociale/aide-financiere/aide-sociale.html">apply for social welfare aid to cover your healthcare</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Luxembourg <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>

<p>You first need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-luxembourg#visas-and-residency" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re employed, your employer will sign you up to pay healthcare insurance contributions.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not working, you need to tell the Centre Commun de la Sécurité Sociale (<abbr title="Centre Commun de la Sécurité Sociale">CCSS</abbr>). You must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a valid passport or ID card</li>
  <li>proof of address</li>
  <li>proof of residency</li>
  <li>proof of income</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Centre Commun de la Sécurité Sociale">CCSS</abbr> will confirm once you’re signed up to the Luxembourg Social Security system.</p>

<p>Once registered, you’ll get an insurance card with your national social security number.</p>

<p>Show this card each time you visit your healthcare provider in Luxembourg.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>State healthcare in Luxembourg is not completely free. You’ll usually pay upfront for treatment.</p>

<p>Expect to pay around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>47 euros to see a GP</li>
  <li>35 to 60 euros to see a specialist</li>
  <li>32 euros for a dentist appointment</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the service or treatment, you’ll get back 80% to 100% of the cost. You’ll get 40% back for non-essential medicines.</p>

<p>Keep the paid invoice and send it to your healthcare fund. They will refund your co-payment.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://cns.public.lu/en/assure/vie-privee/sante-prevention.html" class="govuk-link">See the amounts you’ll get back for different healthcare services</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a limit on how much you’ll have to pay for healthcare services each calendar year. You can get a refund on anything you spend over 2.5% of your annual salary.</p>

<p>Children and hospital in-patients get 100% of their healthcare costs back, unless they’re in a first-class hospital room.</p>

<p>If you get <a rel="external" href="https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/sante-social/action-sociale/aide-financiere/aide-sociale.html" class="govuk-link">social welfare aid</a>, your state healthcare will be free.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Luxembourg temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Luxembourg using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>If you have an S1, you’ll need to register it with the CNS. Once registered, you’ll be issued with an enrolment certificate. This will show you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Luxembourg citizen.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Luxembourg</h2>

<p>There is different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-luxembourg">Luxembourg resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Luxembourg before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it with the Luxembourg national health fund (CNS).</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Luxembourg on the same basis as a Luxembourg citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Luxembourg than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>

<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Luxembourg</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 with the CNS, either by post or in person. You’ll also need to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of your ID card or passport</li>
  <li>a copy of your A1 certificate</li>
  <li>a copy of your UK-issued S1 form</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’re enrolled with the CNS, you’ll get either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Luxembourg health insurance card, if you’re a Luxembourg resident</li>
  <li>an enrolment certificate, if your address is not in Luxembourg</li>
</ul>

<p>This will show you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Luxembourg citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Luxembourg</h2>
<p>You can use an <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
