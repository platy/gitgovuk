</ul>

<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>UK nationals do not need a visa or residency permit to live, work or study in Ireland.  Under the Common Travel Area (CTA), UK and Irish citizens can live and work freely in each other’s countries and travel freely between them. Both the UK and Irish governments are committed to protecting the CTA regardless of the circumstances in which the UK leaves the EU. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance">read our guidance on the CTA</a>.</p>

<p>Irish government’s Citizens Information has <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/">advice about moving to and living in Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Ireland</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-eu-exit">Passports and travel after EU Exit</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, under the CTA the rules for travelling or working in Ireland will not change and you will not require a visa. However there will be changes for living and working in other EU countries.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<p>This does not apply to UK nationals in Ireland. Please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance">Common Travel Area</a> We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You should look at our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ireland/health">travel advice for Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Under the CTA, UK nationals have the right to access healthcare in Ireland. When visiting, UK nationals also have the right to access needs-arising healthcare. Both governments have committed to taking steps to ensure that this will continue after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>More information about healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Ireland is available on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-ireland/">NHS</a> website.</p>

<p>You may need to pay a fee to access public healthcare in Ireland on the same basis as Irish citizens. However, you may be eligible for a means tested medical card. If you do not qualify for a medical card on income grounds, you may qualify for a GP Visit card. You can find more information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/gp_visit_cards.html">Medical and GP Visit Cards</a>.</p>

<p>You can also take out <a rel="external" href="https://www.hia.ie/">private health insurance</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Ireland and get an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit. You will usually be asked to produce some evidence of your entitlement to healthcare in Ireland, such as proof of property rental or ownership. If eligible, you’ll need a medical card that entitles you to receive certain health services free of charge.</p>

<p>You can find a list of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ireland-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">hospitals and doctors in Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Ireland.</p>

<p>If you are visiting Ireland, it is important to take out comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical treatment. 
Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">what your travel insurance should cover</a>.</p>

<p>If you need emergency medical assistance, dial 999 or 112 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment you should contact your insurance and/or medical assistance company immediately.</p>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your pension if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national living in or working in Ireland, working in both the UK and Ireland, or working across the border, you are subject to only one state’s social security legislation at a time. This means you can access your pension from whichever state you are subject to the social security legislation of, regardless of where you are living.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will uprate your UK state pension for the fiscal year 2019/2020 in any scenario. The UK and Irish governments have concluded a bilateral agreement to ensure that social security rights, including access to pensions, will continue to be protected after the UK leaves the EU. This agreement also means that there will be no change to the payment of your UK state pension in Ireland. UK state pensions will continue to be paid as now, including upratings.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>If you are a UK national living in or working in Ireland, working in both the UK and Ireland, or working across the border, you are subject to only one state’s social security legislation at a time. This means you can access social security benefits from whichever state you are subject to the social security legislation of, regardless of where you are living.</p>

<p>You also have the right to access social security benefits on the same basis as citizens of the state you are in.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-ireland">Driving in Ireland</h2>

<p>If you live in Ireland, you should exchange your UK driving licence for an Irish licence before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If you are visiting Ireland, you can drive with your existing UK driving licence.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad">driving abroad</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/FAQs/FAQ%20on%20Brexit%20Implications.pdf">Irish guidance on British driving licences</a>.</p>

<h3 id="driving-in-ireland-after-eu-exit">Driving in Ireland after EU Exit</h3>

<p>If you live in Ireland, you should exchange your UK driving licence for an Irish licence. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Irish government has advised that UK driving licences for UK citizens living in Ireland will no longer be recognised. This means you will no longer be able to drive in Ireland with a UK licence. You should follow the advice of the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ndls.ie/">National Driver Licence Service</a>.</p>

<p>If you are visiting Ireland, the Irish government has advised that you do not need an international driving permit (IDP). If you are visiting Ireland you can continue driving with your existing UK driving licence.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you will need a motor insurance green card to prove that you have sufficient motor insurance when driving in the UK. Green cards are supplied by your insurance company. The UK has applied to rejoin the green card-free circulation zone after the UK leaves the EU. We will update this guidance when there is an agreement on this.</p>

<h2 id="pets">Pets</h2>

<p>If you are planning to travel with a pet, consult your vet.</p>

<p>When the UK leaves the EU, you will still be able to travel to and from the UK with a cat, dog or ferret but the rules will change. You can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pet-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">guidance on pet travel to Europe after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<p>While the UK is still a Member State you will be able to travel with your pet to the EU under the current pet travel rules using your current EU pet passport.  If you are travelling with your pet for the first time you will have to visit your vet to get a pet passport.</p>

<p>Read guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad">Pet travel to the UK</a>.</p>

<p>The Irish government has also published <a rel="external" href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/pets/">information on pet travel</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national living in Ireland you are entitled to register to vote with the relevant authorities for local and national parliamentary elections in that state on the same basis as Irish citizens. You can read the Irish government’s guidance on voting in Ireland.</p>

<p>You may be able to vote in some UK elections. You can:</p>
