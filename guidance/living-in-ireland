<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>UK citizens do not need a visa or residency permit to live, work or study in Ireland. Under the Common Travel Area (<abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>), UK and Irish citizens can live and work freely in each other’s countries and travel freely between them. Both the UK and Irish governments are committed to protecting the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>. Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance/common-travel-area-guidance" class="govuk-link">guidance on the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Ireland’s Citizens Information service has <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/" class="govuk-link">advice about moving to and living in Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>Your travel rights for Ireland are preserved under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance/common-travel-area-guidance" class="govuk-link">Common Travel Area</a>. There will be no changes to the rules on travel between the UK and Ireland after the end of the transition period.</p>

<p>The rules on travel within the rest of the EU will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the Schengen area or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including the UK).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the UK will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ireland/health" class="govuk-link">travel advice for Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>, UK citizens who live in Ireland have the right to access healthcare in Ireland. When visiting, UK citizens also have the right to access needs-arising healthcare.</p>

<p>You may need to pay a fee to access public healthcare in Ireland on the same basis as Irish citizens. However, you may be eligible for a means tested medical card. If you do not qualify for a medical card on income grounds, you may qualify for a GP Visit card. Find information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/gp_visit_cards.html" class="govuk-link">Medical and GP Visit Cards</a>.</p>

<p>You can also take out <a rel="external" href="https://www.hia.ie/" class="govuk-link">private health insurance</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Ireland and get an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit. You will usually be asked to produce some evidence of your entitlement to healthcare in Ireland, such as proof of property rental or ownership. If eligible, you’ll need a medical card that entitles you to receive certain health services free of charge.</p>

<p>Find a list of <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/acutehospitals/hospitals/hospitallist.html" class="govuk-link">hospitals and doctors in Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">check if your prescriptions are legal</a> in Ireland.</p>

<p>If you are visiting Ireland, you should take out comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical treatment. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance" class="govuk-link">what your travel insurance should cover</a>.</p>

<p>If you need emergency medical assistance, dial 999 or 112 and ask for an ambulance. If you are referred to a medical facility for treatment, contact your insurance and/or medical assistance company immediately.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-ireland">Working in Ireland</h2>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>, UK citizens do not need a visa or residency permit to live, work or study in Ireland. Both the UK and Irish governments are committed to protecting the <abbr title="Common Travel Area">CTA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link">UK criminal records check</a>. You can also get a <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/moving_abroad/leaving_ireland/police_certificate.html" class="govuk-link">police certificate</a> from the Gardaí.</p>

<h3 id="professional-qualifications">Professional Qualifications</h3>

<p>UK professionals planning to practice regulated professions in Ireland should check recognition of their professional qualifications before the implementation period ends on 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you have already been recognised by an EU country as holding valid professional qualifications, this will remain valid.</p>

<p>If you have not had your professional qualifications recognised, you can submit an application under the current rules until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>For help with this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the Irish government’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/starting_work/Recognition_of_professional_qualifications_in_ireland.html#l59fac" class="govuk-link">guidance on the recognition of professional qualifications</a>
</li>
  <li>contact the relevant regulatory body for your profession</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>UK bank cards are widely accepted for transactions in Ireland.</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Ireland.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/" class="govuk-link">Citizens Information</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/Home.aspx" class="govuk-link">Revenue.ie</a> have more information about tax in Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>The UK and Irish governments have a bilateral agreement to ensure that social security rights, including existing arrangements for social insurance contributions, will continue to be protected now the UK has left the EU.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your pension if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national living in or working in Ireland, working in both the UK and Ireland, or working across the border, you are subject to only one state’s social security legislation at a time. This means you can access your pension from whichever state you are subject to the social security legislation of, regardless of where you are living.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad" class="govuk-link">State Pension if you retire abroad</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">new State Pension</a>.</p>

<p>If you have worked in Ireland, you can apply to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/a-retired-or-an-older-person.aspx" class="govuk-link">Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection</a>. If you have not worked in Ireland, you can claim your UK State Pension by contacting the International Pension Centre. If you have worked in several EU countries, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances" class="govuk-link">state pensions abroad</a>.</p>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you are getting a UK State Pension and receive a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances" class="govuk-link">‘life certificate’ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible – your payments may be suspended if you do not.</p>

<p>The UK and Irish governments have a bilateral agreement to ensure social security rights, including access to pensions. This agreement means that there will be no change to the payment of your UK State Pension in Ireland. UK State Pensions will continue to be paid as before 31 January 2020, including upratings.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>If you are living in or working in Ireland, working in both the UK and Ireland, or working across the border, you are subject to only one state’s social security legislation at a time. This means you can access social security benefits from whichever state you are subject to the social security legislation of, regardless of where you are living.</p>

<p>You also have the right to access social security benefits on the same basis as citizens of the state you are in.</p>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit can’t be paid if you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<h3 id="irish-benefits">Irish benefits</h3>

<p>The criteria to claim certain Irish social security benefits differ from those in the UK. If you meet Ireland’s five requirements for determining habitual residence then you may be eligible to claim some Irish social security benefits.</p>
