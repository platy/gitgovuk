<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<p>The UK does not have work permits. The UK’s domestic rules allow musicians, entertainers and artists from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa">non-visa national countries</a>, such as EU Member States and the US, to come to undertake paid work in the UK for up to:</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

</div>

The list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/-immigration-rules-appendix-visitor-permit-free-festival-list">permit free festivals</a> is published under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/-immigration-rules-appendix-visitor-permit-free-festival-list">Immigration Rules</a> and includes a range of events, from Glastonbury to Glyndebourne.</p>

See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/worker-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-sponsor-a-creative-worker/worker-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-sponsor-a-creative-worker-accessible-version#other-ways">Other ways Creative Workers can come to work in the UK</a> for further guidance. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa"><strong>Check if you need a visa</strong></a> before you travel.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Paid by a non-UK source and unpaid work:</strong> Non-visa national artists, entertainers or musicians (and their personal, technical and production staff) can give performances, take part in competitions, auditions, make personal appearances and take part in promotional activities for up to 6 months visa-free under the Standard visitor route if they are not receiving payment from a UK source other than prize money or expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Support staff:</strong> Personal or technical staff or members of the production team of an artist, entertainer or musician may support the activities of an artist, entertainer or musician who is coming to the UK under the Standard visitor or Permitted Paid Engagement visitor route, provided they are attending the same event as the artist, entertainer or musician, and are employed to work for them outside of the UK.</p>

<p>Personal or technical staff may support the activities of a Creative Worker on the Temporary Work – Creative Worker route as members of that person’s entourage, provided they meet certain conditions, including that their employment is directly related to the work the Creative Worker will be doing in the UK. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/worker-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-sponsor-a-creative-worker/worker-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-sponsor-a-creative-worker-accessible-version#CRW1">Sponsor a Creative Worker</a> for more information.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Scenario 1</h3>

<p>An orchestra is coming to the UK to perform, for which they will be paid by a UK company that is hosting the event.</p>

<p>If the orchestra is staying for up to one month, they can come under the permitted paid engagement route and do not need to apply for a visa in advance. Upon arrival at the border, they must not use the ePassport gates, and must see a Border Force officer to provide proof of their permitted paid engagement to gain the appropriate stamp in their passports. Without the passport stamp, they will not be allowed to carry out their performance in the UK. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control/at-border-control">Entering the UK - At border control</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If the orchestra intends to stay for up to 3 months, they may be able to use the Temporary Work - Creative Worker visa concession. At the border they must not use the ePassport gates, and must see a Border Force officer and provide their Certificate of Sponsorship to gain the appropriate stamp in their passports. Without the passport stamp, they will not be allowed to carry out their performance in the UK. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/creative-worker-visa/creative-worker-concession">Creative Worker visa concession</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If they intend to stay longer, they will need to apply (before arrival and outside the UK) for a Temporary Work - Creative Worker visa, which will allow them to stay for up to 12 months, with the possibility of extending this by a further 12 months if they continue to work for the same sponsor. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/temporary-worker-creative-and-sporting-visa">Temporary Work – Creative Worker visa</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Scenario 2</h3>

<p>A UK promoter is sponsoring a band from an EU Member State who will be arriving for the second time within 3 months under the Temporary Work – Creative Worker visa concession. The band already holds a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/temporary-worker-creative-and-sporting-visa">Temporary Work - Creative Worker</a> route. The promoter booking the band chose not to certify the band members’ maintenance on their Certificates of Sponsorship.</p>

<p>The band must see a Border Force officer and provide their CoS upon arrival in the UK if they are seeking entry under the concession; they must not use the ePassport gates. Each time they leave the Common Travel Area and want to re-enter the UK under the concession, they must complete this process to gain the appropriate stamp in their passports. Without the passport stamp, they will not be allowed to carry out their performance in the UK.</p>

<p>As the sponsor did not certify maintenance on the bands’ certificates, each band member must provide evidence at the border that they have at least £1,270 in personal savings (plus additional funds for any dependants who are travelling with them). These funds must have been held for at least a consecutive 28-day period ending no more than 31 days before the date of arrival. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/creative-worker-visa">Temporary Work – Creative Worker visa</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other issues</h3>

<p>Travelling creative professionals may also need to consider other issues such as customs, tax and haulage requirements. Further guidance is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/touring-europe-checklists-for-the-arts-cultural-creative-and-heritage-sectors">Touring Europe - checklists for the arts, cultural, creative, and heritage sectors</a>.</p>
