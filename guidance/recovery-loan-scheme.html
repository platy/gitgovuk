<p>The Recovery Loan Scheme ensures businesses of any size can continue to access loans and other kinds of finance up to £10 million per business once the existing COVID-19 loan schemes close, providing support as businesses recover and grow following the disruption of the pandemic and the end of the transition period.</p>

<p>Once received, the finance can be used for any legitimate business purpose, including growth and investment.</p>

<p>The government guarantees 80% of the finance to the lender to ensure they continue to have the confidence to lend to businesses.</p>

<p>The scheme launches on 6 April and is open until 31 December, subject to review. Loans will be available through a network of accredited lenders, whose names will be made public in due course.</p>

<h4>What type of finance is available</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Term loans and overdrafts will be available between £25,001 and £10 million per business.</li>
  <li>Invoice finance and asset finance will be available between £1,000 and £10 million per business.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finance terms are up to six years for term loans and asset finance facilities. For overdrafts and invoice finance facilities, terms will be up to three years.</p>

<p>No personal guarantees will be taken on facilities up to £250,000, and a borrower’s principal private residence cannot be taken as security.</p>

<h4>Eligibility</h4>

<p>You will be able to apply for a loan if your business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is trading in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to show that your business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is viable or would be viable were it not for the pandemic</li>
  <li>has been  impacted by the coronavirus pandemic</li>
  <li>is not in collective insolvency proceedings - further details will be provided in due course</li>
</ul>

<p>Business that have received support under the existing COVID-19 guaranteed loan schemes will still be eligible to access finance under this scheme, if they meet all other eligibility criteria.</p>

<h4>Who cannot apply</h4>

<p>Businesses from any sector will be eligible to apply, except:</p>

<ul>
  <li>banks, building societies, insurers and reinsurers (but not insurance brokers)</li>
