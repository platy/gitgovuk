<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6otYEz9218" rel="external">Being a company director</a></p>

<h2>Your responsibilities to Companies House</h2>

<p>As a director, you’re legally responsible for running the company and making sure information is sent to us on time.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the confirmation statement</li>
  <li>the annual accounts, even if they’re dormant</li>
  <li>any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/company-changes-you-must-report">change in your company’s officers</a> or their personal details</li>
  <li>a change to your company’s registered office</li>
  <li>allotment of shares</li>
  <li>registration of charges (mortgage)</li>
  <li>any change in your company’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/people-with-significant-control-psc-who-controls-your-company">people with significant control</a> (PSC) details</li>
</ul>

<p>You can hire other people to manage some of these things day-to-day (for example, an accountant) but you’re still legally responsible for your company’s records, accounts and performance.</p>

<h2>General duties of a director</h2>

<p>As a director, you must perform a set of 7 duties under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/part/10/chapter/2" rel="external">Companies Act 2006</a>. These still apply if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re not active in your role as director</li>
  <li>someone else tells you what to do</li>
  <li>you act as a director but have not been formally appointed</li>
  <li>you control a board of directors without being on it</li>
</ul>

<h3>Company’s constitution</h3>

<p>You must follow the company’s constitution and its articles of association. These are written rules about running the company, agreed by the members, directors and the company secretary.</p>

<p>The constitution sets out what powers you’re granted as a director, and the purpose of those powers.</p>

<h3>Promote the success of the company</h3>

<p>You must act in the company’s best interests to promote its success. You must consider the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consequences of decisions, including the long term</li>
  <li>interests of its employees</li>
  <li>need to support business relationships with suppliers, customers and others</li>
  <li>impact of its operations on the community and environment</li>
  <li>company’s reputation for high standards of business conduct</li>
  <li>need to act fairly to all members of the company</li>
</ul>

<p>If the company becomes insolvent, your responsibilities as director will apply towards the creditors, instead of the company. A creditor is anyone owed money by the company.</p>

<h3>Independent judgement</h3>

<p>You must not allow other people to control your powers as a director. You can accept advice, but you must use your own independent judgement to make final decisions.</p>

<h3>Exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence</h3>

<p>You must perform to the best of your ability. The more qualified or experienced you are, the greater the standard expected of you.</p>

<p>You must use any relevant knowledge, skill or experience you have (for example, if you’re a qualified accountant).</p>

<h3>Avoid conflicts of interest</h3>

<p>You must avoid situations where your loyalties might be divided. You should consider the positions and interests of your family, to avoid possible conflicts.</p>

<p>You should tell other directors and members about any possible conflict of interest, and follow any process set out in the company’s articles of association.</p>

<p>This duty continues to apply if you’re no longer a director. You must not take advantage of any property, information or opportunity you became aware of as a director.</p>

<h3>Third party benefits</h3>

<p>You must not accept benefits from a third party that are offered to you because you’re a director. This could cause a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>The company may allow you to accept benefits like reasonable corporate hospitality, if it’s clear there’s no conflict of interest.</p>

<h3>Interests in a transaction</h3>

<p>You must tell the other directors and members if you might personally benefit from a transaction the company makes. For example, if the company plans to enter a contract with a business owned by a member of your family.</p>

<h3>Other duties</h3>

<p>Other duties you must perform as a company director include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not misusing the company’s property</li>
  <li>applying confidentiality about the company’s affairs</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact your professional adviser or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.taforum.org/trade-associations/" rel="external">trade association</a> to find out more.</p>

<h2>Directors’ toolkit</h2>

<p>We want to help you make the right choice for your business journey.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about registering your company and becoming a director, you need to understand that this role comes with duties and responsibilities you must consider when running your company.</p>

<p>In addition to the day to day running of your company, you’ll need to file <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/annual-accounts">annual accounts</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/confirmation-statement-guidance">confirmation statement</a> with Companies House every year, and also report any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/company-changes-you-must-report">changes to your company</a> when they happen. You should also keep up to date with any changes in company law.</p>

<p>In return for the benefits of limited liability, anyone who becomes a director or officer of a company will have some of their details made available to the public. It’s important to understand <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/your-personal-information-on-the-public-record-at-companies-house">what personal information is publicly available on the Companies House register</a>.</p>

<p>Companies House has a range of resources available to help you decide if you should incorporate a company and how to become a better director. Here are some useful links and digital tools to help you understand more about the role and responsibilities of a company director.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This guidance does not replace independent legal or other professional advice.</p>

<h3>Email reminders</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-for-email-reminders-from-companies-house">Register for email reminders from Companies House</a>. This service tells you when your company’s accounts and confirmation statements are due by sending you an email.</p>

<p>The service is free, and you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>choose up to 4 people to receive a reminder (including an agent)</li>
  <li>file your document immediately from a link within the reminder</li>
  <li>receive reminders more conveniently</li>
  <li>avoid late filing penalties by filing your accounts on time</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re no longer sending paper reminders by post. Analysis shows email reminders are more successful than paper reminders and users are more likely to file on time.</p>

<h3>Registering for email updates</h3>
