<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU and provides for a deal on citizensâ€™ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the EU broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Hungary at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Hungary.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information</p>

<p>In the meantime, make sure you are registered as a resident in Hungary. We will update this guidance as soon as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Hungary</a>.</p>

<p>You must carry your ID or passport at all times â€“ a copy of your ID or passport wonâ€™t be accepted.</p>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>
<p>If you are resident in Hungary before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay. The Hungarian government is committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re staying more than 3 months, you must register at your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en" class="govuk-link">National Directorate General for Aliens Policing</a> (OrszÃ¡gos IdegenrendÃ©szeti FÅ‘igazgatÃ³sÃ¡g).</p>

<p>You should receive your registration certificate on the spot; your address card will be delivered through the post.</p>

<p>If you move to a different town in Hungary, you must register your address again at the local registry office <a rel="external" href="https://kormanyablak.hu/hu" class="govuk-link">(KormÃ¡nyablak)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-hungary">Driving in Hungary</h2>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Holders of UK driving licences who are resident in Hungary may use their UK licence for a period of one year from the date their residence in Hungary began. After one year, they should exchange their UK licence for a local driving licence. There is no requirement to retake any exams during this process, both for EU and non-EU citizens.</p>

<p>You can still use your Hungarian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are living in Hungary or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, youâ€™ll have life-long healthcare rights in Hungary as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<p>You must be registered for healthcare as a resident in Hungary, and if necessary, healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>If you are employed in Hungary, state health insurance is normally arranged through your employer. Insurance contributions will be deducted from your wages. If youâ€™re self-employed, you can arrange to make <a rel="external" href="http://www.neak.gov.hu/felso_menu/lakossagnak/ellatas_magyarorszagon/jogosultsag_az_ellatasra/az_egsszsegbiztositas_szolgaltatasaira_jogosultak/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulekfizetes/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulek.html#Ki%20k%C3%B6teles%20eg%C3%A9szs%C3%A9g%C3%BCgyi%20szolg%C3%A1ltat%C3%A1si%20j%C3%A1rul%C3%A9" class="govuk-link">voluntary contributions</a> (in Hungarian) through the National Tax and Customs Administration Office.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re seconded to Hungary by your company, there are special rules regarding health insurance. You should contact your companyâ€™s HR department.</p>

<p>If you live in Hungary and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Hungary, you must not use your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> from the UK to access healthcare in Hungary.</p>

<p>When you travel from Hungary for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Hungary to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Hungary have not changed following the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU.</p>
