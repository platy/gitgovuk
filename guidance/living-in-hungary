<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Hungary</a>.</p>

<p>You must carry your ID or passport at all times â€“ a copy of your ID or passport wonâ€™t be accepted.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re staying more than 3 months, you must register at your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en" class="govuk-link">National Directorate General for Aliens Policing</a> (OrszÃ¡gos IdegenrendÃ©sztei FÅ‘igazgatÃ³sÃ¡g).</p>

<p>You should receive your registration certificate on the spot; your address card will be delivered through the post.</p>

<p>If you move to a different town in Hungary, you must register your address again at the local registry office <a rel="external" href="https://kormanyablak.hu/hu" class="govuk-link">(KormÃ¡nyablak)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Hungarian government has committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from the day the UK leaves the EU. For information, read 
<a rel="external" href="https://brexit.kormany.hu/information-for-uk-nationals-and-their-family-members" class="govuk-link">the Hungarian governmentâ€™s website</a>.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible to stay in Hungary on the same terms after Brexit, the Hungarian government requires UK nationals to register with the local <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en" class="govuk-link">National Directorate General for Aliens Policing</a> (OrszÃ¡gos IdegenrendÃ©sztei FÅ‘igazgatÃ³sÃ¡g) by the day the UK leaves the EU, if they have not already done so.</p>

<p>If you arrive in Hungary after Brexit, third country national rules will apply. You will be able to either apply for a <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=75&Itemid=716&lang=en#" class="govuk-link">National Residence Permit</a>or an <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=73&Itemid=714&lang=en#" class="govuk-link">EC Residence Permit</a>. Please check the applicable rules on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en" class="govuk-link">website of the National Directorate General for Aliens Policing</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, the Hungarian government is committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Hungary.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary" class="govuk-link">travel advice for Hungary</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew" class="govuk-link">renew your passport before travelling</a> if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/" class="govuk-link">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You must retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. During this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form part of the next phase  of negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-hungary">Driving in Hungary</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Hungary, you must exchange your UK licence for a Hungarian driving licence before the UK leaves the EU. You can still use your Hungarian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/driving-licence/driving-licence-renewal-exchange/hungary/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link">driving licence renewal and exchange</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary/safety-and-security" class="govuk-link">driving rules in Hungary</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When driving, you should always have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your driving licence</li>
  <li>your car papers</li>
  <li>your insurance paper</li>
  <li>your MOT certificate</li>
  <li>your passport or ID and those of your passengers</li>
  <li>a high-visibility jacket</li>
  <li>a red warning triangle</li>
  <li>first aid kit</li>
</ul>

<p>Holders of UK driving licences who are resident in Hungary may use their UK licence for a period of one year from the date their residence in Hungary began. After one year, they should exchange their UK licence for a local driving licence. There is no requirement to retake any exams during this process, both for EU and non-EU citizens.</p>

<h3 id="bringing-a-uk-registered-vehicle-to-hungary">Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Hungary</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h3 id="driving-after-brexit">Driving after Brexit</h3>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, the process for renewal and exchange of driving licences outlined above will remain in place. For more information please see the <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.kormany.hu/driving-licence" class="govuk-link">Hungarian government driving licence webpage</a>.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prepare-to-drive-in-the-eu-after-brexit" class="govuk-link">driving in the EU after a no-deal Brexit.</a></p>

<p>If there is a deal, driving licence rules will stay the same during the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must be registered for healthcare as a resident in Hungary, and if necessary, healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on who is able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-hungary" class="govuk-link">access healthcare in Hungary and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you are employed in Hungary, state health insurance is normally arranged through your employer. Insurance contributions will be deducted from your wages. If youâ€™re self-employed, you can arrange to make <a rel="external" href="http://www.neak.gov.hu/felso_menu/lakossagnak/ellatas_magyarorszagon/jogosultsag_az_ellatasra/az_egsszsegbiztositas_szolgaltatasaira_jogosultak/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulekfizetes/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulek.html#Ki%20k%C3%B6teles%20eg%C3%A9szs%C3%A9g%C3%BCgyi%20szolg%C3%A1ltat%C3%A1si%20j%C3%A1rul%C3%A9" class="govuk-link">voluntary contributions</a> through the National Tax and Customs Administration Office.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re seconded to Hungary by your company, there are special rules regarding health insurance. You should contact your companyâ€™s HR department.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Hungary, you must not use your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> from the UK to access healthcare in Hungary.</p>

<p>When you travel from Hungary for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Hungary and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident, you must review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The UK has offered to continue paying the country you live in for your healthcare if thereâ€™s no deal, just as it does now. The government has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Hungary for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If thereâ€™s no deal, and there is no arrangement with Hungary to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered in the same way.</p>

<p>The Hungarian government has committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from the day the UK leaves the EU. <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.kormany.hu/information-for-uk-nationals-and-their-family-members" class="govuk-link">Find more information on the Hungarian governmentâ€™s dedicated website.</a></p>

<p>In order to be eligible to stay in Hungary on the same terms after Brexit, the Hungarian government advises that you must register with the local National Directorate General for Aliens Policing (OrszÃ¡gos IdegenrendÃ©sztei FÅ‘igazgatÃ³sÃ¡g) before the UK leaves the EU, if you have not already done so.</p>

<p>You must confirm your residency status and decide how you will ensure access to healthcare if thereâ€™s no deal.</p>

<p>While you are putting arrangements in place for your healthcare, the UK government can help. If you are being asked to pay for treatment during the first 6 months after Brexit, the UK government can pay your healthcare provider directly. To organise a payment, you must give your healthcare providerâ€™s details to the NHS Business Services Authorityâ€™s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if thereâ€™s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> scheme if thereâ€™s no deal, however this is reliant on Hungary continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights of access to healthcare in Hungary will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Hungary.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-hungary/" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare for UK nationals in Hungary</a>, and how this may change after Brexit.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal and you are legally resident in Hungary on the day the UK leaves the EU, you will continue to have the right to work in Hungary without a work permit. If thereâ€™s no deal, and you move to Hungary after Brexit, you will need to have a work permit to have access to the labour market.

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hungary-providing-services-after-eu-exit" class="govuk-link">Read the guidance on providing services after Brexit,</a> if youâ€™re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="education-and-professional-qualifications">Education and professional qualifications</h2>

<h3 id="studying-in-hungary">Studying in Hungary</h3>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, you will continue to be able to study in Hungary but the way you access higher education may change. The Hungarian government has advised that <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.kormany.hu/?_preview=77c0ee37-cbb8-3c68-5313-000018896e75" class="govuk-link">UK students wonâ€™t be able to benefit from courses under the state stipend programmes after Brexit</a>.</p>

<p>You should contact your education provider for more information about your student status and student fees.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of implementation period.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-students-in-the-eu-continuing-your-studies" class="govuk-link">continuing your studies in the European Union after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="professional-qualifications">Professional qualifications</h3>

<p>Professional qualifications gained in the UK, or another EU country, that have been recognised by the Hungarian authorities before Brexit will remain valid if thereâ€™s no deal. If you submit an application for recognition before Brexit, and it is pending after Brexit, the Hungarian authorities will assess it on the basis of the regulations in force when you submitted it.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal and you apply for recognition of professional qualifications after Brexit, the Hungarian authorities will process your application as they would for non-EU qualifications.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, professional qualifications from the UK, or an EU country, will remain valid if they have been recognised by the Hungarian authorities before the implementation period ends.</p>

<p>Read the Hungarian governmentâ€™s <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.kormany.hu/conditions-of-employment-recognition-of-professional-qualifications" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to request recognition of your qualifications</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Hungary to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>Read guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk" class="govuk-link">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

</ul>

<p>In order to pay income tax in Hungary you need to get an income tax card (AdÃ³igazolvÃ¡ny) with your tax number (AdÃ³azonosÃ­tÃ³) from your local <a rel="external" href="http://en.nav.gov.hu/" class="govuk-link">National Tax and Customs office</a>.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Hungary. Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hungary-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">English-speaking lawyer in Hungary</a>.</p>

<h3 id="declaration-of-assets">Declaration of assets</h3>

<p>All residents must declare assets outside Hungary, including bank accounts, securities, rights, insurance, annuities and property. The declaration is separate to the annual tax return, and there are severe penalties and criminal charges for non-compliance.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal and the end date on your form is after the day the UK leaves the EU, you should contact theâ€¯relevant EU or EEA authority. They will confirm whether you need to start paying social security contributions in that country after Brexit, as well as UK National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>Brexit will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Hungary. Send your questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire to Hungary you can claim:</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-brexit">Pensions after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay a State Pension to those eligible in the EU after Brexit. Your UK State Pension will be uprated in April 2020, 2021 and 2022 if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland.</p>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Hungary, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Hungarian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Hungary.</p>

<p>Under existing Hungarian legislation, Hungarian citizens (including those who have repatriated to Hungary and persons holding dual nationality) as well as citizens of other EU Member States over the age of 65 years can travel free of charge on public transport services in Hungary, including BKV in Budapest.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-brexit">Benefits after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Hungary, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Hungarian contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>
