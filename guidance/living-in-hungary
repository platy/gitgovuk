<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Hungary</a>.</p>

<p>You must carry ID at all times – a copy of your passport won’t be accepted.</p>

<p>If you’re staying more than 3 months, you must register at your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en">immigration registry office</a>.</p>

<p>You should receive your registration certificate on the spot; your address card will be delivered through the post.</p>

<p>If you move to a different town in Hungary, you must register your address again at the local registry office <a rel="external" href="https://kormanyablak.hu/hu">(Kormányablak)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency-and-visas-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency and visas after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, the Hungarian government is committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Hungarian government has committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from the day the UK leaves the EU. You can find more information on <a rel="external" href="http://eu.kormany.hu/enbrexit">the Hungarian government’s dedicated website</a>.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible to stay in Hungary on the same terms after the UK leaves the EU, the Hungarian government advises that UK nationals register with the local <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en">Immigration and Asylum Office</a> by the day the UK leaves the EU, if they have not already done so.</p>

<p>If you arrive in Hungary after the UK leaves the EU, third country national rules will apply. You will be able to apply either for a <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=75&Itemid=716&lang=en#">National Residence Permit</a>or for an <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=73&Itemid=714&lang=en#">EC Residence Permit</a>. Please check the applicable rules on <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en">the Immigration and Asylum Office’s website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Hungary. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary">travel advice for Hungary</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You should retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA country to reach your country of residence. We will update this guidance as more information becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You need to make sure you are correctly registered for healthcare as a resident in Hungary, and if necessary, healthcare insurance. You can read the NHS guidance on who is able to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-hungary/">access healthcare in Hungary and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you are employed in Hungary, state health insurance is normally arranged through your employer – they should apply for your National Insurance number. Insurance contributions will be deducted from your wages. If you’re self-employed, you can arrange to make <a rel="external" href="http://www.neak.gov.hu/felso_menu/lakossagnak/ellatas_magyarorszagon/jogosultsag_az_ellatasra/az_egsszsegbiztositas_szolgaltatasaira_jogosultak/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulekfizetes/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulek.html#Ki%20k%C3%B6teles%20eg%C3%A9szs%C3%A9g%C3%BCgyi%20szolg%C3%A1ltat%C3%A1si%20j%C3%A1rul%C3%A9">voluntary contributions</a> through the National Tax and Customs Administration Office.</p>

<p>If you’re seconded to Hungary by your company, there are special rules regarding health insurance. – you should contact your company’s HR department.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Hungary, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) from the UK to access healthcare in Hungary.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice pages and advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you live in Hungary and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">NHS’s guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hungary-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">find an English-speaking doctor in Hungary</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-when-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare when the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights of access to healthcare in Hungary will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Hungary.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The UK has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Hungary for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020.  If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and there is no arrangement with Hungary to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>You should take action now to confirm your residency status and decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. UK nationals will be able to return to the UK for treatment. 
Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal, however this is reliant on Hungary continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>You should read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-hungary/">NHS guidance on healthcare for UK nationals in Hungary</a>, and how this may change once the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-hungary">Working in Hungary</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-hungary-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Hungary after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, if you were legally resident in Hungary on the day the UK leaves the EU, you will continue to have the right to work in Hungary without a work permit. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, UK nationals planning to move to Hungary after the UK leaves the EU will need to have work permits to have access to the labour market. For more information on employment please see the <a rel="external" href="http://eu.kormany.hu/employment">Hungarian government website</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hungary-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Hungary to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/hungary/index_en.htm">paying income tax in Hungary</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In order to pay income tax in Hungary you need to get an income tax card (Adóigazolvány) with your tax number (Adóazonosító) from your local <a rel="external" href="http://en.nav.gov.hu/">National Tax and Customs office</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Hungary. Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hungary-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer in Hungary</a>.</p>

<h3 id="declaration-of-assets">Declaration of assets</h3>

<p>All residents must declare assets outside Hungary, including bank accounts, securities, rights, insurance, annuities and property. The declaration is separate to the annual tax return, and there are severe penalties and criminal charges for non-compliance.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in Hungary.

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Hungary. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire to Hungary you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">UK State Pension</a> and or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension">new UK State Pension</a>
</li>
  <li>contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension Centre</a> to claim</li>
  <li>your Hungarian pension, if you have worked in Hungary</li>
  <li>pensions from working abroad, if you’ve worked in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">‘life certificate’ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible – your payments may be suspended if you don’t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will uprate your UK state pension for the fiscal year 2019/2020 in any scenario.</p>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay State Pension, child benefits and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK’s exit from the EU. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Hungary, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Hungarian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Hungary. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">guidance on claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">which UK benefits you might be able to get while you’re abroad and how to claim them</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit cannot be paid to you.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some Hungarian social security benefits – see <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1113&langId=en">Hungarian social security benefits</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time you’ve worked in the UK from HMRC</a> if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK state pension, child benefits and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Hungary, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Hungarian contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://eu.kormany.hu/social-and-social-security-benefits-in-hungary">Hungarian government has published information about entitlement to benefits</a> for UK nationals after the UK leaves the EU. Most importantly, UK nationals legally resident in Hungary on the date of withdrawal will remain entitled to social and child protection benefits.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-hungary">Driving in Hungary</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Hungary, you should exchange your UK licence for a Hungarian driving licence before the UK leaves the EU, as your UK licence may no longer be valid after the UK leaves the EU. You can still use your Hungarian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Hungary, read the guidance on:</p>

  <li>your car papers</li>
  <li>your insurance paper</li>

  <li>your passport or ID and those of your passengers</li>
  <li>a high-visibility jacket</li>
  <li>a red warning triangle</li>
  <li>first aid kit</li>
</ul>

<p>Holders of UK driving licences who are resident in Hungary may use their UK licence for a period of one year from the date their residence in Hungary began. After one year, they should exchange their UK licence for a local driving licence. There is no requirement to retake any exams during this process, both for EU and non-EU citizens.</p>
