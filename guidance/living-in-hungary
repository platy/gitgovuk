<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Hungary</a>.</p>

<p>You must carry ID at all times â€“ a copy of your passport wonâ€™t be accepted.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re staying more than 3 months, you must register at your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en">National Directorate General for Aliens Policing</a> (OrszÃ¡gos IdegenrendÃ©sztei FÅ‘igazgatÃ³sÃ¡g).</p>

<p>You should receive your registration certificate on the spot; your address card will be delivered through the post.</p>

<p>If you move to a different town in Hungary, you must register your address again at the local registry office <a rel="external" href="https://kormanyablak.hu/hu">(KormÃ¡nyablak)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, the Hungarian government is committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Hungarian government has committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from the day the UK leaves the EU. For information, read 
<a rel="external" href="http://eu.kormany.hu/enbrexit">the Hungarian governmentâ€™s website</a>.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible to stay in Hungary on the same terms after Brexit, the Hungarian government requires UK nationals to register with the local <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en">National Directorate General for Aliens Policing</a> (OrszÃ¡gos IdegenrendÃ©sztei FÅ‘igazgatÃ³sÃ¡g) by the day the UK leaves the EU, if they have not already done so.</p>

<p>If you arrive in Hungary after Brexit, third country national rules will apply. You will be able to either apply for a <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=75&Itemid=716&lang=en#">National Residence Permit</a>or an <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=73&Itemid=714&lang=en#">EC Residence Permit</a>. Please check the applicable rules on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bmbah.hu/index.php?lang=en">website of the National Directorate General for Aliens Policing</a>.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Hungary.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/hungary">travel advice for Hungary</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport before travelling</a> if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. During this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form part of the next phase  of negotiations.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You must retain evidence of travel (e.g. train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must be registered for healthcare as a resident in Hungary, and if necessary, healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>Read the NHS guidance on who is able to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-hungary/">access healthcare in Hungary and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you are employed in Hungary, state health insurance is normally arranged through your employer. Insurance contributions will be deducted from your wages. If youâ€™re self-employed, you can arrange to make <a rel="external" href="http://www.neak.gov.hu/felso_menu/lakossagnak/ellatas_magyarorszagon/jogosultsag_az_ellatasra/az_egsszsegbiztositas_szolgaltatasaira_jogosultak/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulekfizetes/egeszsegugyi_szolgaltatasi_jarulek.html#Ki%20k%C3%B6teles%20eg%C3%A9szs%C3%A9g%C3%BCgyi%20szolg%C3%A1ltat%C3%A1si%20j%C3%A1rul%C3%A9">voluntary contributions</a> through the National Tax and Customs Administration Office.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re seconded to Hungary by your company, there are special rules regarding health insurance. You should contact your companyâ€™s HR department.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Hungary, you must not use a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) from the UK to access healthcare in Hungary.</p>

<p>When you travel from Hungary for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>If you live in Hungary and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are a student, read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights of access to healthcare in Hungary will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Hungary.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident, you must review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The UK has offered to continue paying the country you live in for your healthcare in the event of no deal, just as it does now. The government has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Hungary for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If thereâ€™s no deal, and there is no arrangement with Hungary to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered in the same way.</p>

<p>The Hungarian government has committed to protecting the current rights of UK nationals legally resident in Hungary from the day the UK leaves the EU. <a rel="external" href="https://eu.kormany.hu/enbrexit">Find more information on the Hungarian governmentâ€™s dedicated website.</a></p>

<p>In order to be eligible to stay in Hungary on the same terms after Brexit, the Hungarian government advises that you must register with the local National Directorate General for Aliens Policing (OrszÃ¡gos IdegenrendÃ©sztei FÅ‘igazgatÃ³sÃ¡g) before the UK leaves the EU, if you have not already done so.</p>

<p>You must confirm your residency status and decide how you will ensure access to healthcare if thereâ€™s no deal.</p>

<p>While you are putting arrangements in place for your healthcare, the UK Government can help. If you are being asked to pay for treatment during the first 6 months after Brexit, the UK Government can pay your healthcare provider directly. To organise a payment, you must give your healthcare providerâ€™s details to the NHS Business Services Authorityâ€™s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if thereâ€™s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> scheme if thereâ€™s no deal, however this is reliant on Hungary continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal and you were legally resident in Hungary on the day the UK leaves the EU, you will continue to have the right to work in Hungary without a work permit. If thereâ€™s no deal, UK nationals moving to Hungary after Brexit will need to have work permits to have access to the labour market.

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Hungary to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

</ul>

<p>In order to pay income tax in Hungary you need to get an income tax card (AdÃ³igazolvÃ¡ny) with your tax number (AdÃ³azonosÃ­tÃ³) from your local <a rel="external" href="http://en.nav.gov.hu/">National Tax and Customs office</a>.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Hungary. Find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hungary-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer in Hungary</a>.</p>

<h3 id="declaration-of-assets">Declaration of assets</h3>

<p>All residents must declare assets outside Hungary, including bank accounts, securities, rights, insurance, annuities and property. The declaration is separate to the annual tax return, and there are severe penalties and criminal charges for non-compliance.</p>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<p>If the end date on your form is after 31 October 2019, you should contact theâ€¯relevant EU, EEA or Swiss authorityâ€¯to confirm whether you need to start paying social security contributions in that country after 31 October, as well as UK National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire to Hungary you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">UK State Pension</a> and or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension">new UK State Pension</a>
</li>
  <li>contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pension Centre</a> to claim</li>
  <li>your Hungarian pension, if you have worked in Hungary</li>
  <li>pensions from working abroad, if youâ€™ve worked in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">â€˜life certificateâ€™ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you need to respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you donâ€™t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-brexit">Pensions after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay a State Pension to those eligible in the EU after Brexit. Your UK State Pension will be uprated in April 2020, 2021 and 2022 if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions if thereâ€™s no deal</a>.</p>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Hungary, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Hungarian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Hungary.</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">guidance on claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our tool to check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">which UK benefits you might be able to get while youâ€™re abroad and how to claim them</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit cannot be paid to you if youâ€™re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some Hungarian social security benefits â€“ see <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1113&langId=en">Hungarian social security benefits</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time youâ€™ve worked in the UK from HMRC</a> if you are asked for this.</p>

<p>Under existing Hungarian legislation, Hungarian citizens (including those who have repatriated to Hungary and persons holding dual nationality) as well as citizens of other EU Member States over the age of 65 years can travel free of charge on public transport services in Hungary, including BKV in Budapest.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-brexit">Benefits after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK state pension, child benefits and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals after Brexit.</p>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Hungary, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Hungarian contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://eu.kormany.hu/social-and-social-security-benefits-in-hungary">Hungarian government has published information about entitlement to benefits</a> for UK nationals after Brexit. Most importantly, UK nationals legally resident in Hungary on the date of withdrawal will remain entitled to social and child protection benefits.</p>
