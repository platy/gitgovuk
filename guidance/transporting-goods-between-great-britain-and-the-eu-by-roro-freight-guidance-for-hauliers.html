<h2>Foreign language translations</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://transport-goods-to-and-from-eu.dft.gov.uk" rel="external">Check the Transporting goods to and from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> website</a> to read this guidance in different languages and formats.</p>

<h2>Section 1: Introduction and background</h2>

<p>This guidance is for hauliers and commercial drivers who move goods or pick up/drop off trailers between Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>).</p>

<p>It explains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what documents you need</li>
  <li>how to follow new rules to manage traffic heading to ports</li>
  <li>new border control processes</li>
</ul>

<p>Guidance on moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be published separately.</p>

<h3>Haulier advice sites</h3>

<p>You can also visit an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/haulier-advice-site-locations">advice site at a motorway services or truckstop</a> for the latest information.</p>

<p>At haulier advice sites, heavy goods vehicle (<abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr>) drivers can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>find out about the rules and documents needed to move goods between the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>complete a free border readiness check to ensure they have the correct documentation to cross the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goods: personal allowances</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This guidance will be updated shortly in line with the changes outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-04-28/hcws796" rel="external">written ministerial statement from the Minister for Brexit Opportunities on 28 April</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you are travelling to Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) from outside the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, there are new rules on goods you can bring in for your own use without having to pay tax or duty.</p>

<p>Find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/bringing-goods-into-uk-personal-use">bringing personal goods into the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and to know if you have to make any necessary declarations</a>.</p>

<h3>Rules for drivers and personal food and drink</h3>

<p>Drivers travelling to and from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> should be aware of the rules about what personal food, drink and plants they can take with them. These rules apply to items carried on their person, in luggage or in the vehicle.</p>

<p>Drivers cannot take products containing meat or dairy (for example, a ham and cheese sandwich or coffee with milk) into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Almost all plants and plant products, including fruits, vegetables, flowers and seeds require a phytosanitary certificate before being allowed into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>New rules for bringing animal and plant products from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> into Great Britain will come into effect later in 2022 and we will update the guidance then.</p>

<p>If drivers have banned items with them, or they are not carrying the necessary certification, they will need to use, consume or dispose of them at or before the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border.</p>

<p>Failure to do so may result in them being seized and destroyed with a risk of costs and penalties.</p>

<p>Find out about:</p>

<h3>Securing a vehicle when travelling to and from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> haulage companies and their drivers must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/secure-your-vehicle-to-help-stop-illegal-immigration">secure vehicles</a> coming into the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of crime.</p>

<p>Drivers crossing the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border should be aware of the potential threats to vehicles and loads and how they can help stop ‘clandestine entrants’. A clandestine entrant is a person who hides in or on a vehicle to avoid going through <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border control.</p>

<p>If a driver does not secure a vehicle, and is found carrying clandestine entrants into the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> controlled zones, the vehicle’s driver, owner or hirer can each be fined up to £2,000 for each person found (also known as a ‘civil penalty’).</p>

<p>The law applies to all arrivals into the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> control zones, including from European ports and via the Eurotunnel.</p>

<h4>Keeping vehicles secure</h4>

<p>For haulage companies, an effective system includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>written instructions for drivers on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-hauliers-on-preventing-clandestine-entrants">how to use the system</a>
</li>
  <li>robust security devices to effectively secure the vehicle, load and load space</li>
  <li>evidence of training for drivers on how to use the system and security devices
providing vehicle <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vehicle-security-checklist">security checklists to drivers</a>
</li>
  <li>monitoring that drivers are complying with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-penalty-code-of-practice-prevention-of-clandestine-entrants">codes of practice</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For drivers, an effective system includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>application of security devices (e.g. a padlock, uniquely numbered seals and tilt cord) to secure vehicles after loading</li>
  <li>checking the security devices and vehicle thoroughly after each stop and before entering the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>recording comprehensive checks on a vehicle security checklist, to show compliance, and have available to present to a Border Force officer</li>
</ul>

<p>Drivers should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-hauliers-on-preventing-clandestine-entrants">10 step guidance</a> on preventing clandestine entrants, and carry this with them throughout their journey.</p>

<h3>If someone hides in a vehicle </h3>

<p>If a driver suspects someone is attempting to enter their vehicle or has entered their vehicle, they should contact local police as soon as it is safe to do so. In the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> call 999 or in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> call 112 before you enter the port.</p>

<h3>Inland border facilities</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/attending-an-inland-border-facility">Inland border facilities</a> (<abbr title="inland border facilities">IBFs</abbr>) are <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government sites where customs and documentary checks can take place away from port locations.</p>

<p><abbr title="inland border facilities">IBFs</abbr> act as an Office of Departure (for outbound journeys) and as Office of Destination (for inbound journeys).</p>

<p>Checks for the following movements are carried out at <abbr title="inland border facilities">IBFs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Common Transit Convention (<abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr>), also known as Transit</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet</li>
  <li>Transports Internationaux Routiers (<abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr>) Carnet</li>
  <li>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<abbr title="convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora">CITES</abbr>)</li>
  <li>other forms e.g. C108, duplicate lists etc – check with your trader what you need to carry</li>
</ul>

<p>Stays at an <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr> are time limited to 2 hours. You may incur extra charges if you stay longer than 2 hours.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr> app is available for smartphones on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.visionist.hmrc.oodesdep&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" rel="external">Google play store</a> and the App store.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: Not all hauliers will need to attend an IBF unless required to undertake an Office of Transit check. For example: if you are starting or ending a CTC movement at the premises of an Authorised Consignor or Authorised Consignee and already have a validated Transit Accompanying Document (TAD), you do not need to attend an IBF.</p>
</div>

<p>It is important to note that <abbr title="inland border facilities">IBFs</abbr> are not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>truck stops/rest points for drivers – drivers should check the amount of driving time left on their tachographs when entering an <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr> to minimise risk for having to find a place (elsewhere) for the mandatory rest breaks while also wanting to attend the <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>places to initiate customs formalities (go elsewhere for those services – there are no customs agents on site)</li>
  <li>mandatory for every export – if you already have all your paperwork for both sides and Permission to Progress (<abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr>) from <abbr title="customs handling of import and export freight">CHIEF</abbr> then you don’t need to attend an <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr>
</li>

<h3>Kent traffic management</h3>

<p>Congestion may occur if <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> drivers reach the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel without the correct documentation or because of delays for other reasons (e.g. bad weather). The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.kentprepared.org.uk/preparing-for-brexit" rel="external">Kent Resilience Forum</a> has plans in place to deal with this. Kent Police will decide when to activate parts of the plans, depending on the level of any congestion.</p>

<p>Traffic management arrangements involving the M20 movable barrier may be deployed if required. Signage will direct hauliers as necessary if that occurs.</p>

<p>If travelling through Kent, be aware that there is potential for disruption if there are delays at the border. <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> drivers should plan their journey to ensure that they can take breaks and, in particular, overnight rest periods before entering Kent. This will minimise the risk of reaching drivers’ hours limits.</p>

<h3>Traffic management at other ports</h3>

<p>The Short Straits routes via Kent are particularly vulnerable to disruption, and this area is the focus of most traffic management plans. Highway Authorities with high volume ports may also have localised traffic management schemes. During normal business these will only be introduced if there is abnormal traffic disruption and hauliers should follow local traffic signs if these are implemented.</p>

<h3>Empty trucks and trucks with reusable packaging</h3>

<p>If you are carrying packaging, you will need to check with the importer and/or exporter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether it meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/declaring-reusable-packaging-for-great-britain-imports-and-exports">reusable packaging criteria</a>
</li>
  <li>whether you have the authority to make a declaration by conduct on their behalf on import</li>
  <li>whether the declaration is for the free circulation procedure or temporary admission</li>
  <li>check the rules in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> (and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) about swap body containers</li>
  <li>check the rules about machinery mounted on <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> to facilitate loading and unloading</li>
</ul>

<p>These items include plastic or metal cages, crates or frames.</p>

<p>At <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> entry locations you can make a declaration by conduct for all reusable packaging. The declaration by conduct will generally be by disembarking from a vessel.</p>

<p>At <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> entry locations, the haulier should check whether the packaging is <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> origin as this will impact which formalities you need to follow.</p>

<p>On export the declaration by conduct will be made by driving across the boundary of a port.</p>

<p>Find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/declaring-reusable-packaging-for-great-britain-imports-and-exports">declaring reusable packaging for <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> imports and exports</a>.</p>

<h2>Section 2: Driver and haulier requirements, licenses and responsibilities</h2>

<h3>Drivers: documents, licences and permits</h3>

<h4>Driver Certificate of Professional Competence</h4>

<p>All <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> drivers need a Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (<abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr>) in order to work. Drivers need to carry their Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> qualification card while driving in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Drivers working for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operators</h4>

<p>Drivers with a current <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> working for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operators do not need to take any additional action regarding qualifications. A <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> is valid for drivers of all journeys that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operators are entitled to undertake, either on the basis of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Trade and Cooperation Agreement or on the basis of <abbr title="European Conference Minister of Transport">ECMT</abbr> permits.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> drivers can work for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operators with a Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> awarded by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states. If such drivers wish to have long-term certainty on their ability to work for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operators, they should exchange their <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr>. To do this you’ll need to send your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> card to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> if you want to exchange it for a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> card or to the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Agency">DVA</abbr> if you live in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/driver-cpc-training/if-you-have-a-licence-from-other-countries">exchanging a <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Given the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is a third country, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals may need a ‘third country driver attestation’ in case they do not meet the conditions set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32009R1072&amp;from=EN" rel="external">Regulation 1072/2009</a> ‘on common rules for access to the international road haulage market’.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> drivers working for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> operators</h4>

<p>Drivers who hold a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Driver <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> working or wanting to work for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> businesses should check with the relevant organisation in the country where they live and work to find out what they need to do.</p>

<h4>Driving licences and international driving permits</h4>

<p>Drivers need the correct category of driving licence for the vehicle they are driving. Drivers can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-licence-categories">check the driving categories on their licence</a>.</p>

<p>You do not need an International Driving Permit (<abbr title="international driving permit">IDP</abbr>) to drive in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein if you have a photocard driving licence issued in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>You might need an <abbr title="international driving permit">IDP</abbr> to drive in some <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries and Norway if you have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a paper driving licence</li>
  <li>a licence issued in Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit">Check if you need an <abbr title="international driving permit">IDP</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>IDPs can be purchased over the counter at many <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Post Office branches. An <abbr title="international driving permit">IDP</abbr> costs £5.50.</p>

<h4>Visas, passports and identity cards</h4>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> drivers need at least 6 months on a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passport to travel to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Drivers can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">check if they need to renew their passport</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> drivers can operate in most <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states without the need for a visa or a work permit, providing they do not spend more than 90 days in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> within any 180-day period. However, visa and work permit arrangements for undertaking paid work in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is a matter for individual member states, and operators should check with the relevant authority of each country in which they plan to undertake work before travelling.</p>

<p>Information about how to get a visa if you need one is on each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a>.</p>

<p>Before 1 October 2021, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) and Swiss nationals can enter the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> with a passport or national identity card.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2021, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Swiss national identity cards will no longer be accepted as a valid travel document and a passport will be required for entry to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. This will not apply to those <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Swiss citizens who have applied to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eusettledstatus"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Settlement Scheme</a> by 30 June 2021 or otherwise have protected rights under the Citizens’ Rights Agreements. Gibraltar identity cards issued to British citizens and Irish passport cards will also continue to be accepted for travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Further details on the new requirements and exceptions will be provided on GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>There may be delays when <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk">applying for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> visa</a> as a professional driver.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> haulier requirements: documents, licences and permits</h3>

<h4>Access to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h4>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operators can undertake unlimited journeys to, from and through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Up to 2 additional movements (cross-trade or cabotage) may be undertaken within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> following a laden journey from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, with a maximum of 1 cabotage movement within a 7-day period. It must be within the same <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country where you dropped off your goods brought into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Both additional movements may be cabotage movements in Ireland for Northern Ireland operators provided they follow a laden journey from Northern Ireland and are performed within a 7-day period.</p>

<p>Own-account operators (operators transporting their own goods) who are carrying goods for a commercial purpose are subject to these cabotage and cross-trade rules when operating in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Movements that do not count as cabotage/cross-trade:</p>

<ul>
  <li>driving an empty trailer from one <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country to another</li>
  <li>only dropping off goods in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> that you transported from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>only picking up goods in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries, which can then only be dropped off in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, not another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</li>
</ul>

<h4>Operator licensing: <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Licence for the Community</h4>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> hauliers undertaking international work need the relevant operator licence.</p>

<p>A copy of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Licence for the Community should, in all circumstances, be carried on board all vehicles when working in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="European Conference Minister of Transport">ECMT</abbr> permits</h4>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> hauliers who wish to undertake up to 3 cross-trade movements (moving goods between 2 countries outside the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) may do so using a European Conference of Ministers of Transport (<abbr title="European Conference Minister of Transport">ECMT</abbr>) permit.</p>

<p>Find out about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ecmt-international-road-haulage-permits"><abbr title="European Conference Minister of Transport">ECMT</abbr> application process</a>.</p>

<h4>Motor insurance Green Card</h4>

<p>A Green Card is proof of vehicle insurance when driving abroad. From 2 August 2021, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> drivers do not need to carry a Green Card when driving in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (including Ireland), Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Serbia or Switzerland.</p>

<h4>Vehicle registration documents</h4>

<p>Drivers need to carry vehicle registration documents when driving abroad. This can be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vehicle log book (V5C), if you have one</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk/for-less-than-12-months#taking-hired-or-leased-vehicles-abroad-temporarily">VE103</a> to show you’re allowed to use a hired or leased vehicle abroad</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> sticker</h4>

<p>Vehicles registered in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> must display the letters ‘<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’ when driven abroad (excluding Ireland).</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> identifiers</a> can either be incorporated in vehicle number plates (along with the Union flag) or as a separate sticker.</p>

<p><abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> stickers must be replaced by <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> stickers.</p>

<p>Drivers do not need a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> sticker to drive in most countries (except Spain, Cyprus and Malta) if their number plate includes a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, identifier with the Union flag (i.e. the Union Jack).</p>

<p>Vehicles registered in Great Britain or Northern Ireland do not need to display a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> sticker to drive in Ireland.</p>

<p>Drivers must display a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> sticker clearly on the rear of vehicles and trailers if their number plate has any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a European flag symbol</li>
  <li>a national flag of England, Scotland or Wales</li>
  <li>numbers and letters only – no flag or identifier</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> haulier requirements: documents, licences and permits</h3>

<h4>Access to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h4>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> operators can undertake unlimited journeys to, from and through the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, with up to 2 cabotage movements in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, provided they are performed following a laden journey from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, and within 7 days of unloading in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Community Licence</h4>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> operators must be licensed by their own country of establishment and carry a True Certified Copy of the Community Licence at all times.</p>

<h4>Driver and vehicle documentation</h4>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> operators doing business to, from or through the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> need to carry proof of motor insurance for their vehicle and trailer. A Green Card or other proof of motor insurance is recognised in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. However, green cards are not mandatory for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> drivers in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Cross-border responsibilities when moving goods</h3>

<h4>Trader</h4>

<p>It is the trader’s responsibility to make customs declarations and provide the haulage company and driver with the correct documents. This can be done directly or via a third party, for example a freight forwarder, logistics company or customs agent.</p>

<h4>Haulage company</h4>

<p>The haulage company must ensure their operations have access to <abbr title="information technology">IT</abbr> systems such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-for-the-goods-vehicle-movement-service">Good Vehicle Movement Service</a> (<abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>) and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-to-make-an-entry-summary-declaration-in-great-britain"><abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> safety and security</a> (<abbr title="safety and security">S&amp;S</abbr> <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) – this can be done by registration and will require the haulier to have a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="economic operator registration and identification">EORI</abbr>) number.</p>

<p>The driver should have all the necessary customs information and documents and other paperwork for the route they intend to use. If the haulier intends to use a third-party to complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3"><abbr title="safety and security">S&amp;S</abbr> <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr></a> entry, they will need to have put this in place via the third-party software or the community service provider (<abbr title="community system provider">CSP</abbr>).</p>

<p>The haulage company must also make sure that their drivers know what documents to present at each stage of the journey, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at ports or train terminals</li>
  <li>at customs posts</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: Depending on your route, some or all of these documents may be submitted digitally in advance. Please ensure you understand the process for the route you are using</p>
</div>

<h4>Driver</h4>

<p>The driver must carry the information and documentation provided by the haulage company in the vehicle for the duration of the journey. This also includes information and documentation necessary to meet <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state requirements. This is because each movement of goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is both an export movement for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> authorities and import movement for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> authorities, and vice versa.</p>

<p>It is vital that drivers know what information and documentation is needed, and where, when and how they will be presented and checked.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Section 3: Safety and security requirements – <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> and <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This guidance will be updated shortly in line with the changes outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-04-28/hcws796" rel="external">written ministerial statement from the Minister for Brexit Opportunities on 28 April</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Background and upcoming changes</h3>

<p>There are 2 types of safety and security declarations: an exit summary (<abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr>) declaration and an entry summary (<abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>) declaration.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has a temporary <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration waiver, but this will soon be removed and, from 1 July 2022, <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations will be required for all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> movements (unless otherwise exempt).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has had full <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> and <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration requirements in place since 1 January 2021. Specific procedural details on a member state by member state basis are listed later in the document for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#safety-and-security-belgium">Belgium</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#safety-and-security-france">France</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#safety-and-security-spain">Spain</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Entry summary declaration (<abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>For accompanied roll on roll off (<abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr>) freight, the haulier (as the carrier and operator of the active means of transport) is responsible for submitting the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration – also known as the safety and security declaration – at the first point of entry. This is of particular importance at <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-roll-on-roll-off-ports"><abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> ports and terminals</a> that do not have port inventory systems.</p>

<p>For unaccompanied <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> freight, the ferry operator (as the carrier and operator of the active means of transport) is responsible for submitting the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration at the first port of entry. For ports with inventory linking, the ferry operator will complete the manifest. For example, in the Netherlands the manifest must have all the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> date entries for that ferry, prior to it being allowed to leave the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. The information will need to be provided before the ship departs the port.</p>

<p>The data required for an <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consignor</li>
  <li>consignee</li>
  <li>a description of the goods</li>
  <li>routing (country by country)</li>
  <li>conveyance (e.g. ferry or Eurotunnel details)</li>
  <li>time of arrival</li>
</ul>

<p>An <abbr title="economic operator registration and identification">EORI</abbr> number is required to make <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations. This needs to be a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>’ <abbr title="economic operator registration and identification">EORI</abbr> number for <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> safety and security (or ‘XI’ <abbr title="economic operator registration and identification">EORI</abbr> number for Northern Ireland)</li>
  <li>valid <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state <abbr title="economic operator registration and identification">EORI</abbr> number for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations</li>
</ul>

<p>A third party may lodge a declaration as long as this is done with the knowledge of the carrier and consent. However, it remains the carrier’s responsibility to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an entry summary declaration is submitted</li>
  <li>declarations are submitted within the legal time limits</li>
</ul>

<p>The third party must also make sure that the information given by the carrier is accurate.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> is not required for goods covered by an <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> or <abbr title="Carnet de Passages en Douane">CPD</abbr> carnet (Carnet de Passages en Douane) provided the goods are not moved under transport contract.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>, the carrier will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-to-make-an-entry-summary-declaration-in-great-britain">sign up for access to the <abbr title="safety and security">S&amp;S</abbr> <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> service</a> to lodge <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations. This process can also be completed by a third party with their knowledge and consent.</p>

<h3>Exit summary declaration (<abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>A carrier (meaning the haulier for accompanied <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> movements, and ferry operator for unaccompanied) is required to submit any <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations to the customs authority of the country from which the consignment is being exported.</p>

<p><abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> data is normally included in the export declaration (which is a customs declaration). If a customs export declaration has been lodged, there is no need for a separate <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declartion. The person normally responsible for submitting a combined declaration is the exporter of the goods, or their representative.</p>

<p>A standalone <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration is usually required if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods have remained in temporary storage for more than 14 days</li>
  <li>the goods have remained in temporary storage for less than 14 days but the import safety and security declaration details are unknown or where the destination or consignee details change</li>
  <li>an empty container is being moved under a transport contract (a transport contract, or contract of carriage, such as a CMR, airway bill, or bill of lading, is an agreement between a carrier and shipper or passenger, setting out each party’s duties and rights)</li>
</ul>

<p>Carriers moving their own empty units or hauliers driving their own empty vehicles, may not be moving these under a transport contract.</p>

<p>A standalone <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration is also usually required if the goods are moved under transit using a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transit Accompanying Document (<abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr>) or Transit and Safety and Security Declaration (<abbr title="transit and safety and security declaration">TSAD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Transports Internatioaux Routiers (<abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr>) carnet document</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="transit and safety and security declarations">TSADs</abbr> cannot be used to meet safety and security requirements in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>.</p>

<p>For combined safety and security, customs export declarations, and for standalone safety and security <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations, the submission can be made on the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="customs handling of import and export freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system or the Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>). There is still the option to submit <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations through <abbr title="community system provider">CSP</abbr> systems or third-party software providers.</p>

<p>A standalone <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration is not required if empty pallets, empty containers and empty trucks are moved out of <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> not under a transport contract or if the goods are covered by an <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> or <abbr title="Carnet de Passages en Douane">CPD</abbr> carnet.</p>

<h2>Section 4: Moving goods from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (exporting from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>)</h2>

<h3>Customs requirements</h3>

<p>To enter the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, goods must satisfy customs requirements outlined in general terms in section 4a. Additionally, 3 types of movement (<abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr>, <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr>, <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr>) could alter the customs processes required.</p>

<p>Regardless of which process you use, you will need to consult and understand section 4a for general import/export requirements.</p>

<h2>Section 4a: Moving goods from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> – general process</h2>

<p>As of 1 January 2022, full export controls and checks are in place for movements to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and border locations will need processes to control goods for export.</p>

<p>This means that goods must be presented to customs before they reach the frontier or at the frontier.</p>

<p>They must not be exported without permission and a message must be sent after their departure.</p>

<p>Border locations can use different systems to fulfil their exports obligations, there is no specific system mandated for the export process.</p>

<p>Examples of systems that are commonly used are the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-for-the-goods-vehicle-movement-service">Goods Vehicle Movement Service (<abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>)</a> – hauliers will need <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> to link export declaration references together into one single Goods Movement Reference (<abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>), the driver will present the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> at the port or terminal of exit and the carrier will be responsible for capturing and validating the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> at check-in</li>
  <li>Inventory-linked Systems – declarations will be pre-lodged by the declarants, hauliers will then move the goods to the border location where they will be arrived and presented. If any checks are required, this will take place within the border location’s approved premises</li>
</ul>

<p>Only goods moving via specified locations, identified as having space constraints and where modified export controls apply, are able to submit an arrived declaration.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-locations-need-an-arrived-export-declaration-from-1-january-2022">check locations where export declaration need to be submitted as arrived</a>.</p>

<p>The new procedures are outlined in the exports section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-border-operating-model">Border Operating Model</a>.</p>

<h3>Preparing for export from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>: customs documents and procedures that hauliers need to know</h3>

<p>The hauliers need to determine if the goods would be exported through a location using the <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> for export controls and if the port is one with limited space <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-locations-need-an-arrived-export-declaration-from-1-january-2022">where arrived export declarations should be used</a>.</p>

<p>Further information on the different processes can be found in the exports section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-border-operating-model">Border Operating Model</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/export-goods">how to export goods from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If the goods are not moving under transit, the exporter/agent/freight forwarder should provide the haulier with all customs documents for the pre-lodged import declarations for the member state the haulier is crossing the border to.</p>

<h3>What are the export procedures?</h3>

<p>It is the responsibility of the exporter to inform the haulage company about the Permission to Progress (<abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr>) and they can depart for the border.</p>

<p>For inventory linked ports, including all unaccompanied freight, the trailer operator must provide the Unique Consignment Number (<abbr title="unique consignment number">UCN</abbr>), provided by the exporter, in order to leave the goods at the port and have them accepted.</p>

<p>Note: For inventory linked ports, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> import detail may not yet be known. It may be that there is no information for the driver about the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> import at the time of export. The exporter/loader needs to clarify to the driver/trailer operator what the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state requirements are. If this information is shared digitally, the driver does not necessarily have it (or they often pick up a copy upon arrival on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> side).</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Hauliers must continue to create a goods movement reference (GMR) for empty loads or loads with multiple import or export declarations.</p>
</div>

<h4><abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr></h4>

<p>If exiting <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> using locations using the <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> to control goods, hauliers will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask the exporter or agent to provide the correct references for each consignment carried</li>
  <li>link all these references together, alongside any safety and security declaration references, into 1 <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> for each vehicle movement – this can be done in 2 ways:
    <ul>
      <li>a direct link from the haulier’s own system into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-for-the-goods-vehicle-movement-service"><abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr></a>; or</li>
      <li>an online portal available in the haulier’s Government Gateway account</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for each vehicle, update the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> with the correct vehicle registration number (<abbr title="vehicle registration number">VRN</abbr>) – this can be updated to cater for any changes but must be correct when the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> is presented to the carrier at the point of departure</li>
  <li>instruct drivers not to proceed to the border before all the necessary references are added into a <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> to make it complete, or if any declaration reference has not been accepted onto the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>, as they will not be allowed to board</li>
  <li>instruct drivers to present the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> to the ferry operator/Eurotunnel on arrival at the point of departure to demonstrate they have the necessary evidence to legally move goods</li>
</ul>

<p>If exiting through an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-locations-need-an-arrived-export-declaration-from-1-january-2022">arrived export location</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The haulier will need to enter all export declaration references (DUCRs) associated with the vehicle movement into the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>. <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> will validate each <abbr title="declaration unique consignment reference">DUCR</abbr> and confirm whether the goods have Permission to Proceed (<abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr>) or whether there are any outstanding controls.</li>
  <li>The haulier will then need to check with their declarant on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-locations-need-an-arrived-export-declaration-from-1-january-2022">what checks need to happen</a>. Some checks can be completed at the trader’s premises, while others will require attending an Inland Border Facility or at the port’s designated customs checking facility.</li>
  <li>Drivers must not proceed to the point of exit until all DUCRs have <abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr> status and the GMRs have been validated.</li>
  <li>At the point of exit the driver will present the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> to the carrier and the carrier will validate the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> at check-in. <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> will reject the check-in attempt unless all the DUCRs in the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> have been arrived, in which case the vehicle will be turned away from check-in.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Before you exit <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If exiting through an arrived export location, once the declaration is submitted, the declarant will be informed if their document or goods need to be checked.</p>

<p>If a physical examination is required, the declarant will need to tell the haulier present the goods at the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-locations-need-an-arrived-export-declaration-from-1-january-2022">Inland Border Facility</a> for goods leaving Dover, Holyhead or Eurotunnel or the port for goods leaving Liverpool, Heysham, Milford Haven/Pembroke or Fishguard.</p>

<p>For accompanied <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> freight, the driver must have all necessary reference numbers or documents to meet the import requirements of the country they are entering in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. It is the responsibility of the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> exporter (with their customs agent and/or logistics provider) to ensure this is done, unless they have agreed another party will take responsibility for this as part of their incoterms.</p>

<p>You may need to submit an <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">section 3</a>.</p>

<h3>At the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>The driver must follow the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states’ import and border requirements for the country they are entering. Further country specific information for the main <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states for <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> freight is set out below.</p>

<h4>Moving goods through the short straits – <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to France</h4>

<p>France has implemented a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.douane.gouv.fr/fiche/la-frontiere-intelligente" rel="external">smart border system</a> for processing freight using both the ferry and Eurotunnel crossings. It pairs customs declaration data with the vehicle registration number transporting the consignment(s).</p>

<p>They have also produced substantial guidance and comms. At check-in at the Port of Dover ferry terminals or at the ‘pitstop’ at Eurotunnel’s Cheriton terminal, the driver will hand in the <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr>(s) from the transit or French import declaration. The <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> will be scanned and matched with the Vehicle Registration Number (<abbr title="vehicle registration number">VRN</abbr>) or Trailer Registration Number (<abbr title="trailer registration number">TRN</abbr>) - trailers are at Dover only.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: The process for sending data can also be done digitally on the Eurotunnel portal or via electronic data interchange (EDI). That generates a Eurotunnel Border Pass (EBP) with which the driver does not need to show any paperwork at the pitstop but can continue on this reference.</p>
</div>

<p>For consignments from multiple traders, either the exporter or the driver can scan all the barcodes from the separate documents, using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.douane.gouv.fr/enveloppe/en/enveloppe" rel="external">Enveloppe website</a>. This will create an <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> envelope. The driver will then only need to present 1 single <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> from the load they are carrying.</p>

<p>This data is analysed by the French customs system while the driver and consignment(s) are on the ferry or shuttle train crossing the Channel. It allows <abbr title="heavy goods vehicles">HGVs</abbr> or <abbr title="light goods vehicles">LGVs</abbr> to be pre-selected for further customs and/or sanitary and phytosanitary (<abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary">SPS</abbr>) controls.</p>

<p>The driver will be informed en route – via screens on board the driver carriage at Eurotunnel or in the drivers lounges on the ferries if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they can proceed – they will be ‘green routed’</li>
  <li>they need to present to goods for customs and/or <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary">SPS</abbr> – either ‘Orange-douane’ or ‘Orange-<abbr title="veterinary and phytosanitary inspection service">SIVEP</abbr>’</li>
  <li>there are any problems which need to be addressed before they can continue their journey - they will be ‘Orange-routed’</li>
</ul>

<p>On disembarkation of the ferry or shuttle service, if selected for a control (i.e. orange routed), it is the driver’s responsibility to follow that guidance – if they ignore the routing, they could face penalties. Also, to note, that there may also be selections from green routed trucks to check compliance.</p>

<h5>Safety and security declarations for entry into France</h5>

<p>For freight from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>, <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations must be submitted into the French Import Control System (<abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>) before crossing the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border. Submission can only be made by <abbr title="electronic data interchange">EDI</abbr> using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.douane.gouv.fr/services-aide/edi" rel="external">certified software (or web portals)</a>.</p>

<p>For accompanied freight, the haulier makes the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration entry into the French <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>.</p>

<p>For unaccompanied freight, the ferry operator makes the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration entry into the French <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>.</p>

<h5>Compliance regimes in France (customs and <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary">SPS</abbr>)</h5>

<p>If you are selected for a control on entry to France, either for customs or <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary">SPS</abbr> or both, you must follow the orange routing signage (for either customs or <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary">SPS</abbr>) to attend the facility.</p>

<p>If you are selected for an <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary">SPS</abbr> control (<abbr title="veterinary and phytosanitary inspection service">SIVEP</abbr>), you must seek help from a ‘commis’ service (for ferries) or Eurotunnel operatives (for Eurotunnel) to unload, load and present your consignments and to the administrations</p>

<h4>Moving goods through Dutch ports – <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to continental Europe</h4>

<p>The Netherlands logistics industry has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.getreadyforbrexit.eu/en/" rel="external">advice on how to pass through Dutch ports</a>. This will help freight and logistics operators with the various formalities involved in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-Dutch transportation of goods. The import can only be created once the manifest is submitted to Dutch customs, a process that happens once the ferry has left <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>.</p>

<p>If there is a transit starting from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> side the ferry line will report this to customs via Portbase.</p>

<h5>Safety and security declarations for entry into the Netherlands</h5>

<p>The <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> data for the safety and security declarations are submitted at the time of booking the crossing. The transmission of the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration is always completed by the carrier (i.e. the ferry operator) for both accompanied and unaccompanied freight when the ferry departs via Portbase into the Netherlands <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Moving goods through Belgian ports</h4>

<p>The majority of <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> freight via the port of Zeebrugge is currently unaccompanied. There are 5 steps. The haulier normally has a role in step 3 and step 5.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> trailer operator or person booking the crossing supplies the shipping company with the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> data at the time of booking and gives it to the shipping company.</li>
  <li>The Ferry Operator does the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration to customs at the same time as doing the temporary storage declaration to customs.</li>
  <li>The terminal operator produces a discharge notice to the importer, forwarder, customs agent or haulier.</li>
  <li>The customs representative does a follow up declaration to customs.</li>
  <li>The terminal operator issues a cargo release to the haulier for them to pick the goods up.</li>
</ol>

<p>The RX/Seaport digital system joins up the data submitted and required by all parties at the Port of Zeebrugge. The data is registered for imports and exports through their e-Desk. This can be done manually, through a linked data connection or through customs software.</p>

<p>Drivers will not be allowed to leave the terminal if discharge notice is not given and the cargo released (on arrival in Zeebrugge) nor can they proceed to the Zeebrugge Terminal if customs declarations have not been pre-notified through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://rxseaport.eu/en/our-services/" rel="external">RX/SeaPort e-Desk</a>.</p>

<p>RX/SeaPort has detailed information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://rxseaport.eu/en/import-wizard/" rel="external">importing</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://rxseaport.eu/en/export-wizard/" rel="external">exporting</a> through the Port of Zeebrugge.</p>

<p>At Antwerp the pre-notification of customs documents is done via the Port Community system of C-point. This pre-notification can be lodged by the exporter, the freight forwarder, customs agent or the haulage company.</p>

<p>C-point has detailed information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.c-point.be/en/services" rel="external">customs procedures at Antwerp</a>.</p>

<p>Check with your ferry operator about the use of any <abbr title="information technology">IT</abbr> platform.</p>

<h5>Safety and security declarations for entry into Belgium</h5>

<p><abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations should be submitted into the import clearance system via an <abbr title="electronic data interchange">EDI</abbr> interface to the Paperless Customs and Excises (<abbr title="Paperless Douanes and Accises">PLDA</abbr>) system.</p>

<p>In Belgium the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration submission is done by the ferry operator or shipping company for both accompanied and unaccompanied freight.</p>

<h4>Moving goods through Spanish ports</h4>

<p>Hauliers going from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to Spain should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make or arrange to make the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration into the Spanish <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>obtain the <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>log into the maritime carrier (Brittany Ferries) system and link the vehicle registration number to the <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the system checks the first 4 digits of the Integrated Tariff of the European Communities (<abbr title="Integrated Tariff of the European Communities">TARIC</abbr>) code, number of packages and weight</li>
</ul>

<p>The data must be sent to the carrier in advance of the <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> arriving at the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> port or the driver must have it with them.</p>

<h5>Safety and security declarations for entry into Spain</h5>

<p>An <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration must be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.agenciatributaria.es/AEAT.internet/en_gb/Inicio/La_Agencia_Tributaria/Aduanas_e_Impuestos_Especiales/_Presentacion/La_Aduana_espanola/_INFORMACION/Informacion_general_sobre_presentacion_por_Internet/Presentacion_de_Declaracion_Sumaria_de_Entrada__ENS_/Presentacion_de_Declaracion_Sumaria_de_Entrada__ENS_.shtml" rel="external">lodged for all consignments</a>. The ferry operator must be satisfied that this requirement has been met before loading will be authorised.</p>

<p>For accompanied freight, the haulier makes the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration entry (using <abbr title="electronic data interchange">EDI</abbr> only) into the Spanish <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>. This doesn’t rule out the possibility of a private agreement between the ferry operator and the haulier for the ferry operator to make the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration for accompanied freight.</p>

<p>For unaccompanied freight, the ferry operator makes the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration entry into the Spanish <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The ferry operator sends the manifest (including references to previous <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations) to the operatives in the Spanish ports. The operatives then send the documents to Aduanas (Spanish customs).</p>

<h4>Moving goods through Irish ports</h4>

<p>All <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> import declarations need to be submitted to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs-traders-and-agents/customs-electronic-systems/ais/what-is-ais/index.aspx" rel="external">Automated Import System</a> (<abbr title="automated import system">AIS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The Irish Revenue Customs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/customs/customs-roro-service.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> Service</a> provides 3 functions to facilitate the flow of commercial vehicles into and out of Irish ports. The 3 functions are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pre-boarding notification – customs declarations should be made in advance of arrival at the port of departure in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. The details of safety and security and customs declarations for all goods to be carried on an <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> need to be recorded in the pre-boarding notification (<abbr title="pre-boarding notification">PBN</abbr>). The <abbr title="pre-boarding notification">PBN</abbr> is a virtual envelope that links together the details of all the goods being carried on an <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr>. The customs authority will provide a single instruction to be followed by the driver on arrival at an Irish port, regardless of the number of consignments on board the vehicle.</li>
  <li>Channel look-up (<abbr title="channel look-up">CLU</abbr>) – hauliers can track the progress of the <abbr title="pre-boarding notification">PBN</abbr> via the Customs <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> Service so that they know when to arrive at the terminal. The <abbr title="channel look-up">CLU</abbr> service provides information on whether an <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> can directly exit the port or if the goods need to be brought to customs for checking. This information will be made available via the Customs <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> Service 30 minutes prior to arrival of the ferry into Ireland and can be accessed by anyone in the supply chain.</li>
  <li>Parking self check-in – drivers whose vehicles have been called for a physical inspection will remain in their vehicle and inform Revenue that the goods are available for inspection using this function. When an examination bay becomes available the driver will receive a text message advising where to attend for inspection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the Customs <abbr title="roll on roll off">RoRo</abbr> Service is a prerequisite to receive the <abbr title="pre-boarding notification">PBN</abbr> without which access to the ferry will be denied.</p>

<h5>Verification and release regimes in Ireland</h5>

<p>If issues cannot be resolved goods will be held in temporary storage for a maximum of 90 days.</p>

<p>Holding areas are in place around ports but space is limited. If goods are seized, claims must be made within 1 month and in writing.</p>

<p>Traders must pay a fee to use border control posts (<abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr>) and an additional fee may be required if notification is not received prior to arrival.</p>

<p>Goods may be refused entry or destroyed if <abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary">SPS</abbr> requirements are not met.</p>

<h5>After the Irish border</h5>

<p>Once the goods have passed <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs, if they have not been selected for a control, they can proceed to their destination.</p>

<h5>Safety and security declarations for entry into Ireland</h5>

<p>There is a legal requirement to submit an electronic customs safety and security declaration in advance of import.</p>

<p>This declaration is called an entry summary (<abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>) declaration. The <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration must be submitted to Irish customs in advance of the goods departing <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>.</p>

<p>The carrier is responsible for ensuring that the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declaration is submitted. Accordingly, the importer must ensure that the carrier of your goods is aware of their responsibilities for this declaration. Failure to do so will lead to delays.</p>

<p>Find out about the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs-traders-and-agents/documents/electronic/ics-trade-guide.pdf" rel="external">Import Control System (<abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr>) Trader Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Section 4b: Moving goods from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> – <abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr> movements</h2>

<h3>Before leaving <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the trader decides to move the goods under the Common Transit Convention (<abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr>) starting in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>, the haulier will need either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a transit accompanying document (<abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr>) from the trader, and be told by the trader that the movement has been released to the transit procedure and that they can proceed to the place of exit from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>.</li>
  <li>a local reference number (<abbr title="local reference number">LRN</abbr>) or a <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> that hasn’t been released to the transit procedure, and be told to present the goods and the <abbr title="local reference number">LRN</abbr> or <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Border Force at a nominated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Office of Departure</a> – the goods will then be released, and a <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> will be given to the driver
    <ul>
      <li>a single vehicle may need multiple <abbr title="local reference numbers">LRNs</abbr> – you will need to convert all <abbr title="local reference numbers">LRNs</abbr> into TADs to continue your movement in a compliant manner</li>
      <li>an <abbr title="local reference number">LRN</abbr> will need an accompanying <abbr title="customs handling of import and export freight">CHIEF</abbr> entry (usually performed by your <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> exporter) to be released</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: check beforehand as the process can vary per port.</p>
</div>

<p>The exporter/agent is responsible for updating the haulage company and driver on the status of the <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">Safety and security</a> requirements apply as normal in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> for goods being moved using transit.</p>

<p>Combined <abbr title="transit and safety and security declarations">TSADs</abbr> cannot be used to meet safety and security requirements in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> (<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declarations). Traders moving goods under transit need to ensure that the appropriate safety and security declarations are made via other means in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> where necessary.</p>

<p>As <abbr title="transit and safety and security declarations">TSADs</abbr> cannot currently be used for <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> requirements on transit movements from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, separate <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> entries must be made into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Transit System (<abbr title="EU transit system">NCTS</abbr>), and separate <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations must be made into that member state’s <abbr title="Import Control System">ICS</abbr> using a commercial <abbr title="electronic data interchange">EDI</abbr> platform.</p>

<h3>At the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>If the movement is being made under the <abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr>, the <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> must be presented by the driver to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs authorities in line with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s procedures. In many cases, the ferry operator/Eurotunnel will do this on your behalf. Check with your carrier before you travel.</p>

<h3>After the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>If the movement is made under the <abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr>, the driver must present the <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> at an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/rd/rd_list.jsp?Lang=en&amp;DesLang=&amp;AllRoles=N&amp;Country=&amp;trafficTypeCode=&amp;roles=DES&amp;Expand=true" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Office of Destination</a> or to an authorised consignee, where the transit procedure will be closed. The goods will then be subject to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> import procedures.</p>

<h2>Section 4c: Moving goods from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> – <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnets procedure</h2>

<p><abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnets are international customs documents used for the suspension of duties where goods will be re-exported within a year.</p>

<h3>Before leaving <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the trader arranges for the goods to move under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-ata-carnet"><abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Convention</a> the driver must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtain the <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet document from the trader</li>
  <li>take the goods and the <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Border Force at a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Office of Departure</a> to get the Carnet stamped</li>
  <li>as instructed by the trader, their agent or the logistics company controlling the movement</li>
  <li>check with the trader that the safety and security <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration requirements have been met for the movement – relevant safety and security <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> requirements must also be met for the country the goods are being moved to</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: Ensure that the driver of the truck is either: listed explicitly in ‘Box B’ of the Carnet, or the Carnet is accompanied by a signed authorisation letter from one of the Carnet holders, indicating their permission for the driver to move the goods and sign ‘Box F’ on their behalf.</p>
</div>

<p>The driver should ensure that the front cover of the Carnet has been signed and completed correctly before departure.</p>

<h3>At the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>The driver must present the <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet and ensure it is stamped by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs authorities in line with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s procedures.</p>

<h3>After the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>If the movement is made under the <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Convention, the driver should give the <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet to the recipient of the goods when they are delivered. This is so the <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet is available to return the items to their country of origin, if not transported back by the same outbound haulage company.</p>

<h2>Section 4d: Moving goods from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> – <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Convention procedure</h2>

<p><abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnets are international customs documents used for the transport of goods across borders.</p>

<h3>Before leaving <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>In order to move under the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Convention, the haulier must hold a <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> authorisation obtained in his/her country and the vehicle moving the goods must hold an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-certificates-of-approval-for-individual-road-vehicles-produced-under-a-design-type-authorisation-application-form-gv69">approval certificate of a road vehicle for the transport of goods under customs seal</a>.

<p>The <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> system allows <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> customs officials to pack and seal goods before they’re transported to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or to third countries. This means that the load will not need to be opened and inspected by customs officials at border crossings.</p>

<p>Book a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/specialist-tests-for-lorries/the-tir-test"><abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> test</a>.</p>

<p>The haulage company must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give the driver the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet</li>
  <li>ensure that arrangements have been made, either by the trader or haulage company to declare the movement to <abbr title="EU transit system">NCTS</abbr> once the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> movement enters the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and have the reference numbers (<abbr title="local reference number">LRN</abbr> and/or <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr>) needed to present to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs authorities. Note: the part of the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> journey undertaken in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> is not declared on <abbr title="EU transit system">NCTS</abbr>, and so <abbr title="EU transit system">NCTS</abbr> references will not need to be presented to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> customs authorities</li>
  <li>instruct the driver to:
    <ul>
      <li>take and present the goods and the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Office of Departure</a> where the page 1 of <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet will be stamped and detached by the customs officer and customs will seal the vehicle</li>
      <li>take and present the goods and the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Border Force at a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Office of Departure – customs will check the documents and ensure that the seal is intact, and will stamp and detach page 2 of the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet</li>
      <li>note: these 2 steps occur simultaneously at the Border Force office</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>check with the trader that the safety and security <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> declaration requirements have been met for the movement – relevant safety and security <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> requirements must also be met for the country the goods are being moved to (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">safety and security</a> for the procedure for submitting <abbr title="exit summary">EXS</abbr> and <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr> declarations)</li>
</ul>

<h3>At the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>If the movement is made under the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Convention, the driver must present the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet and ensure it is stamped by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs authorities in line with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s procedures.</p>

<h3>After the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>The driver must present the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet and ensure it is stamped by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs authorities either when the goods leave the customs territory of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or at an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/rd/rd_list.jsp?Lang=en&amp;DesLang=&amp;AllRoles=N&amp;Country=&amp;trafficTypeCode=&amp;roles=DES&amp;Expand=true" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Office of Destination</a> or at an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-<abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> authorised consignee’s premises.</p>

<p>Once the vehicle has completed its journey, the driver must return the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet to their office/manager.</p>

<h2>Section 4e: Additional requirements for moving specific goods into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Moving excise goods out of <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Excise goods are alcohol, tobacco or energy products.</p>

<p>If the goods are subject to excise duty, in addition to other commercial documents, the driver must receive from the trader one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the electronic administrative document (<abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>commercial documents clearly showing the administrative reference code (<abbr title="administrative reference code">ARC</abbr>) for the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a paper <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-internal-accompanying-document-products-subject-to-excise-duty-w8">W8 form</a> for energy products</li>
  <li>a copy of the customs declaration</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving animal, plant and other controlled products into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Haulage companies and drivers who transport animal, plant, and other controlled products, need to be aware which locations in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> have <abbr title="border control posts">BCPs</abbr> for carrying out checks on these products.</p>

<p>The haulage company and driver should not start to move these types of goods until they are certain that the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>importer or exporter have checked that the route they intend to take is appropriate</li>
  <li>border location they intend to use is authorised to move the goods they are carrying</li>
  <li>trader has given them an Export Health Certificate (<abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr>) to accompany the goods</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that several <abbr title="export health certificates">EHCs</abbr> may be needed for a single truckload even if all goods are collected from the same site.</p>

<h3>Moving animals, animal products, plants, fish and fishery products into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Traders moving animals or animal products from <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-importing-and-exporting-live-animals-or-animal-products">apply in advance for an <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The trader will need to make sure the <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> is signed by an authorised person after the consignment has been inspected.</p>

<p>Rules vary depending on the type of product and where they are exporting them to.</p>

<p>Check the export rules and check that the route goes through an appropriate <abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr> in the country of entry for exports of:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-or-moving-fish-from-the-uk">fish and fishery products</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A phytosanitary certificate (<abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr>) must accompany consignments of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/importing-and-exporting-plants-and-plant-products">plants and plant products</a>. A trader applies for a <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr> from the relevant plant health authority:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) in England and Wales</li>
  <li>Scottish Government in Scotland</li>
  <li>Forestry Commission in England, Wales and Scotland for wood, wood products and bark</li>
</ul>

<p>The driver needs to confirm with the trader or haulage company that the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-based import agent has told the relevant <abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr> about the arrival of the consignment at least 24 hours before intended arrival.</p>

<p>The driver must carry a physical copy of each <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> or <abbr title="phytosanitary certificate">PC</abbr> for their consignment. The consignments may be checked upon arrival at the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr>. The driver should always check before arriving at the first <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> port of arrival if a physical document is required. Failure to do so has consequences, i.e. those being without the check at the first <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> port of arrival the driver may be told to return to that first port of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> arrival before the load can be delivered and offloaded at destination.</p>

<h3>Moving marine-caught fish for human consumption into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>In addition to an <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr>, exporters of wild-caught marine fish for human consumption will need to provide additional documentation.</p>

<p>Exporters of most wild-caught marine fish for human consumption caught and landed by <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> vessels will need to obtain a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/create-a-uk-catch-certificate"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> catch certificate</a> for each consignment to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Exporters of most wild-caught marine fish for human consumption caught and landed by third countries need to supply a copy of the third country catch certificate for each consignment to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Exporters may also need other documentation such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>processing statements: if third country fish has been processed in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> – this can be applied for through the Fish Export Service</li>
  <li>storage documents: if the imported fish has remained in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for a period of time and has not undergone any operations other than loading or unloading – this can also be applied for through the Fish Export Service</li>
</ul>

<p>Exporters will send a copy of the documents to their <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> importer. The importer in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> needs to submit these to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> competent authority in advance of the import. Please check with the importing member state the required notice period. This is generally at least 4 hours in advance.</p>

<h3>Moving live animals into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>To transport live animals into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, transporters need to apply to an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state, where they have representation, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> transporter authorisation</li>
  <li>a certificate of competence</li>
  <li>a vehicle approval certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> does not recognise <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued versions of these documents.</p>

<p>Transporters are not permitted to hold transporter authorisation or vehicle approval in more than one <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state.</p>

<p>For further information contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency"><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h4>Journey logs</h4>

<p>To transport live animals from, or through, England, Scotland or Wales into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> transporters need to apply for 2 journey logs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>one approved by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state which is the first point of entry into the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>one approved by <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving endangered or protected animal or plant species, and their parts or by-products under <abbr title="convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora">CITES</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Endangered or protected animal or plant species, and their parts or by-products, under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<abbr title="convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora">CITES</abbr>) can only pass through designated ports.</p>

<p>Check the latest information on these <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-importing-and-exporting-live-animals-or-animal-products">ports and <abbr title="convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora">CITES</abbr> permit and notification requirements</a>.</p>

<p>Certain products may fall under both the categories of products of animal origin and <abbr title="convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora">CITES</abbr> items and must therefore comply with the 2 sets of requirements.</p>

<h2>Section 5a: Moving goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> – Pre-lodgement/temporary storage</h2>

<h3>Before leaving an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State (except Ireland)</h3>

<p>When collecting the goods, the haulier must be given all the relevant customs information or documents and other paperwork. The haulier must confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the exporter has completed the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> export procedures</li>
  <li>with the importer the type of import declaration they are making and secure the right evidence to demonstrate a declaration has been made depending on the route</li>
</ul>

<h4>Island of Ireland to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>
</h4>

<p>For goods that are in Ireland (or Northern Ireland, where applicable) immediately before their importation into <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>, there are different customs requirements for controlled goods and non-controlled goods.</p>

<p>At present, until such time further changes are announced, the evidence needed will depend on what type of declaration the importer is able or chooses to make, including whether the goods are controlled.</p>

<h4>Controlled goods</h4>

<p>Customs declarations in <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> systems are required for all goods on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-goods-imported-into-great-britain-from-the-eu-that-are-controlled">controlled goods list</a>.</p>

<p>When moving controlled goods, the haulier must have the appropriate reference number from the import declaration (<abbr title="customs handling of import and export freight">CHIEF</abbr> entry number or the <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr>). If pre-lodged temporary storage declarations are being used, the haulier will need the inventory consignment reference (<abbr title="inventory consignment reference">ICR</abbr>).</p>

<p>The exporter’s <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> or an <abbr title="economic operator registration and identification">EORI</abbr> number cannot be used as evidence that an import declaration has been made for these goods.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-border-operating-model">Border Operating Model</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Non-controlled goods</h4>

<p>Non-controlled goods moving from the island of Ireland to Great Britain can continue to do so on the basis of the arrangements that applied prior to 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>This is a temporary facilitation that enables the importer to either make a customs declaration at the point of import or make a declaration in their own commercial records, and then follow this with a supplementary declaration that must be submitted to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> within 175 days of the point of import.</p>

<p>The haulier must have either the reference number from the customs import declaration (<abbr title="customs handling of import and export freight">CHIEF</abbr> entry number or <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr>) or the trader’s <abbr title="economic operator registration and identification">EORI</abbr> number if the importer has made a declaration in their commercial records. If <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/movements-to-temporary-storage-facilities">pre-lodged temporary storage declarations</a> are being used, the haulier needs the inventory consignment reference (<abbr title="inventory consignment reference">ICR</abbr>).</p>

<p>Find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/delaying-declarations-for-eu-goods-brought-into-great-britain">delaying declarations for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> goods brought into <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The driver must check which type of declaration the importer is making and carry the appropriate evidence.</p>

<h3>Goods from other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>As of 1 January 2022, import controls and checks are in place and border locations have processes to control imported goods. Locations where <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-locations-you-need-to-use-pre-lodged-declarations">pre-lodgement is needed</a> use the <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>. Locations using the temporary storage model use an inventory system and hauliers will need to follow commercial instructions.</p>

<p>The new procedures are outlined in the imports section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-border-operating-model">Border Operating Model</a>.</p>

<p>List of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/list-of-ports-using-the-goods-vehicle-movement-service">ports using <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If hauliers are moving goods through a location using the <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>, they will be required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask the importer to provide, for each consignment carried, a unique reference number that proves that a declaration has either been pre-lodged or is not needed – this can be an <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> (for goods declared into <abbr title="customs handling of import and export freight">CHIEF</abbr> or <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>link all these references together, alongside any safety and security declaration references (required from July 2022), into 1 goods movement reference (<abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>) for each vehicle movement – this can be done in 2 ways:
    <ul>
      <li>a direct link from the haulier’s own system into the <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>; or</li>
      <li>an online portal available in the haulier’s Government Gateway account (if the ferry operator is submitting the <abbr title="entry summary">ENS</abbr>, the haulier will need to check how to consolidate this into 1 <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for each vehicle movement, update the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> with the correct <abbr title="vehicle registration number">VRN</abbr> – this can be updated to cater for any changes but must be correct when the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> is presented to the carrier at the point of departure</li>
  <li>instruct drivers not to proceed to the border before all the necessary references are added into a <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> to make it complete, or if any declaration reference has not been accepted onto the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>, as they will not be allowed to board</li>
  <li>instruct drivers to present the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> to the carrier on arrival at the point of departure to demonstrate they have the necessary evidence to legally move goods – this can be presented through paperwork, mobile phone, tablet etc</li>
  <li>instruct drivers to check whether their vehicle is cleared or not cleared before disembarking and to follow instructions on where to go if checks are required</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: Ensure you have made a declaration into <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-to-make-an-entry-summary-declaration-in-great-britain">S&amp;S GB</a> if you need to, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">section 3</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>At the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h4>

<p>The driver must have, for each consignment, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> export declaration <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> as evidence of a customs declaration from the declarant in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>For goods that are in Ireland (or Northern Ireland, where applicable) immediately before their importation into <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>, the driver must have evidence of a customs declaration from the declarant in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>For goods imported at locations using <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>, the driver must present a <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> containing the declaration reference, or references, for all the goods to the carrier.</p>

<p>Some locations that use <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> alongside other customs models may operate alternative processes. If you’re moving goods through one of these locations, you should check with the carrier you’re intending to travel with about what information you need to clear customs</p>

<p>Some of these processes can be done digitally.</p>

<h4>At the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border</h4>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> authorities do not routinely stop vehicles on their way into the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to check that they have the correct import customs documents.</p>

<p>However, on arrival, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Border Force officers may stop vehicles to carry out certain checks. When they do, they may take the vehicle off-line and ask the driver to present the references (for example, <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>, <abbr title="customs handling of import and export freight">CHIEF</abbr> entry number, <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> and/or <abbr title="economic operator registration and identification">EORI</abbr>) for each consignment, along with other documentation or information as required.</p>

<p>When goods are imported at locations where pre-lodgement is needed and are moved without sufficient evidence that a declaration has been made, the haulier may be liable to a penalty.</p>

<p>On arrival, the haulier and the driver must follow <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> instructions about whether they need to get the goods checked or if they are able to continue their journey. They may be directed to an <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr> for documentary or physical checks of their load if these checks cannot be done at the border.</p>

<p>This currently applies for border locations at Dover, Eurotunnel terminal at Cheriton and Holyhead. The goods must be taken to an <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr> directly and must be in the same condition as they were at the time of importation.</p>

<p>A driver can check the status of their goods themselves using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/driver-inspection-notification/start" rel="external">Check if you need to report for an inspection</a> service, as long as they have access to a device that can access the internet, such as a mobile phone.</p>

<p>The person who created the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> should ensure that the goods arrive at an <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr> for a check and that the drivers are made aware or have the means to check if an inspection is required.</p>

<p>It is important that the haulier ensures that their supply chain is compliant and that drivers understand their responsibilities to take goods to an <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr> if required.</p>

<p>You may be liable to a penalty of up to £2,500 if you fail to follow <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> instructions. Whenever <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> needs to consider penalties, they will always take into account the facts and what has gone wrong, on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>Section 5b: Moving goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> – <abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr> movements</h2>

<h3>Before leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the exporter arranges for the goods to move under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-use-transit-to-move-goods-to-the-eu-and-common-transit-countries"><abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr></a> the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> must be created and the haulier must be given either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> from the exporter/agent, and be told by the exporter/agent that the transit movement has been started and the <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> has been activated and that they can proceed to the place of exit from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state.</li>
  <li>An <abbr title="local reference number">LRN</abbr> or <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> that hasn’t been released into transit must be presented to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state authorities at a nominated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/col/col_list.jsp?Lang=en&amp;DesLang=&amp;AllRoles=N&amp;trafficTypeCode=&amp;roles=DEP&amp;Expand=true" rel="external">Office of Departure in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state</a> – the goods will then be released and a <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> will be given to the driver.</li>
</ol>

<p>The exporter/agent is responsible for updating the haulage company and driver on the status of the <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr>.</p>

<h3>At the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>If the movement is being made under the <abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr>, the <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> must be presented by the driver following the procedures in place at each member state.</p>

<p>This may be performed digitally in many cases.</p>

<h3>For entry to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: For safety and security requirements, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">section 3</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>For goods moving under the <abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr>, haulage companies must follow either the paper-based process or the <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> process to complete the transit movement on entry to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>. Which process applies will depend on the location the goods arrive at. An overview of locations and processes is included within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-border-operating-model">Border Operating Model</a>.</p>

<p>Exporters/agents must give the haulage company all <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> <abbr title="movement/master reference numbers">MRNs</abbr> which has been activated for each <abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr> consignment. A valid <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> proves that the driver has the right declaration to move goods under transit. The paper <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> must also always travel with the goods moving via transit.</p>

<p>If entering the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> at a location using the paper-based procedure, the haulier will need to report to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit">Office of Transit</a> with the goods and paper <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> on arrival in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Customs authorities will complete the Office of Transit process and request any necessary inspections.</p>

<p>If entering the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> at a location using the <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>, haulage companies must use <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> to link all the <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> <abbr title="movement/master reference numbers">MRNs</abbr> into 1 <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> for each trailer movement.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: A GMR may include non-CTC consignments (e.g. CHIEF entry numbers) for trucks carrying both CTC and non-CTC goods.</p>
</div>

<p>The haulage company must ensure the Office of Departure processes, including any control actions, are completed and that the transit movement has started before they enter any detail into the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>.</p>

<p>If they enter a <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr> for a movement that has not been released, <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> could invalidate the transit declaration for the movement. The trader would need to submit a new transit declaration to restart the transit movement before the goods could be moved to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>They can use <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr> in 2 ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a direct link from their own system into the <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the online service on GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> – a Government Gateway user <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> and password are required for this</li>
</ul>

<p>For each trailer movement using <abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>, haulage companies or drivers update the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> with the correct <abbr title="vehicle registration number">VRN</abbr> for accompanied movements, or <abbr title="trailer registration number">TRN</abbr> or container reference number (<abbr title="container reference number">CRN</abbr>) for unaccompanied movements. The <abbr title="vehicle registration number">VRN</abbr>/<abbr title="trailer registration number">TRN</abbr>/<abbr title="container reference number">CRN</abbr> can be updated to cater for any changes but must be correct when the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> is presented to the carrier at the point of departure.</p>

<p>Drivers cannot board international ferries or Eurotunnel without a valid <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>. They must not proceed to the border:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before all the necessary references are added into a <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>if any transit declaration reference has not been accepted onto the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Drivers need to present the <abbr title="goods movement reference">GMR</abbr> to the carrier on arrival at the point of departure to show that they have the necessary evidence to legally move goods.</p>

<p>Drivers must comply with instructions issued by border authorities to proceed to a specific location for checks once arrived in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, if necessary.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: The GMR can only be updated using the same access as the one used to create it. You cannot ask another company to update it unless you share your own access to GVMS. This is very different to, for example, the French Envelope system, because any company can access it on the website to update it before the crossing.</p>
</div>

<h3>After the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border</h3>

<p>If the movement is made under the <abbr title="common transit convention">CTC</abbr>, the driver must present the <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> at the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/rd/rd_list.jsp?Lang=en&amp;DesLang=&amp;AllRoles=N&amp;Country=&amp;trafficTypeCode=&amp;roles=DES&amp;Expand=true" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Office of Destination</a> or to an authorised consignee, where the transit procedure will be closed. The goods will then be subject to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> import procedures or will need to be entered to another customs facilitation.</p>

<p>The driver must be aware of the location of their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit">Office of Destination</a> declared by the trader. This could be at the port of entry, an <abbr title="inland border facility">IBF</abbr> or an authorised consignee location. The driver must report to the right location with the goods and the paper <abbr title="transit accompanying document">TAD</abbr> to close the movement. Failure to do so may result in delays to the procedure being closed, and difficulty releasing the financial guarantee.</p>

<h2>Section 5c: Moving goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> – <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnets procedure</h2>

<h3>Before leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>

<p>If the trader arranges for the goods to move under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-ata-carnet"><abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Convention</a> the driver must obtain the <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet document from the trader.</p>

<h3>At the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>The driver must present the <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet with a letter of authorisation (if applicable) and ensure it is stamped by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs authorities in line with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s procedures.</p>

<h3>At the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border</h3>

<p>The driver must follow the port’s local procedures for the presentation of an <abbr title="admission temporaire/temporary admission">ATA</abbr> Carnet.</p>

<h2>Section 5d: Moving goods from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> – <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Convention procedure</h2>

<h3>Before leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>In order for the goods to move under the Transports Internationaux Routiers (<abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr>) Convention, the haulier must hold a <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> authorisation obtained in their country and the vehicle moving the goods must hold an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-certificates-of-approval-for-individual-road-vehicles-produced-under-a-design-type-authorisation-application-form-gv69">approval certificate of a road vehicle for the transport of goods under customs seal</a>.</p>

<p>The haulage company must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give the driver the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet</li>
  <li>ensure that arrangements have been made, either by the trader or haulage company, to declare the movement to the <abbr title="EU transit system">NCTS</abbr> and have the reference numbers (<abbr title="local reference number">LRN</abbr> and/or <abbr title="movement/master reference number">MRN</abbr>) needed to present the goods to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs authorities</li>
  <li>instruct the driver to take and present the goods and the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs authorities at an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/col/col_list.jsp?Lang=en&amp;DesLang=&amp;AllRoles=N&amp;trafficTypeCode=&amp;roles=DEP&amp;Expand=true" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Office of Departure</a> (or the Office of Departure of a third country outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>At the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border</h3>

<p>The driver must present the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet and ensure it is stamped by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> customs authorities in line with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s procedures.</p>

<h3>At the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border</h3>

<p>The driver must follow the port’s local procedures for the presentation of the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet.</p>

<p>The driver must present the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet to the customs office located at the port to open the transit movement for the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> leg. Customs will check the documents, the seal, put a stamp on the relevant page of <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet and detach it.</p>

<p>The driver will go to the customs Office of Destination or <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> authorised consignee’s premises to ensure that the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet is handled. After that the customs seals can be removed and goods unloaded.</p>

<p>It is possible that the border customs office performs both entry and destination <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> procedures.</p>

<p>Once the vehicle has completed its journey, the driver must return the <abbr title="carnet and transport internationaux routiers">TIR</abbr> Carnet to their office/manager.</p>

</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: The processes outlined in this section are additional processes to be conducted as well as the other processes.</p>
</div>

<h3>Moving excise goods into the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If goods are going to an excise warehouse in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, the driver will need to ensure that they hold either a copy of the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> or commercial documents that clearly state the <abbr title="administrative reference code">ARC</abbr>, before they leave the port. Drivers should obtain these documents from their customer or an intermediary working on their behalf.</p>

<p>However, if the importer has used a simplified customs procedure that allows for the arrival of the goods to be delayed, the creation of the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> will also be delayed until the goods have arrived. The driver must instead ensure they hold a copy of the pre-lodged customs declaration, which must include details of an excise movement guarantee, before leaving the port.</p>

<p>If goods are still travelling to their delivery address by the end of the next working day following import, the importer (or their agent) should supply the driver at this point with a copy of the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> or the <abbr title="administrative reference code">ARC</abbr> to formalise the excise movement requirements.</p>

<h3>Moving live animals and high-priority plants and plant products into <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If the driver is carrying high-priority plants and plant products, live animals or goods covered by <abbr title="convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora">CITES</abbr> the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> exporter or their agent must make sure that they provide the following documents and/or data to accompany the consignments. The driver needs to present these at check-in at the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the original, wet signed, <abbr title="export health certificates">EHCs</abbr> if one or several are needed</li>
  <li>any <abbr title="convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora">CITES</abbr> documentation required</li>

<p>As of January 2022, for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> movements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>products of animal origin (for example, meat, honey, milk or egg products) and animal by-products will need pre-notification</li>
  <li>all regulated plants and plant products will need pre-notification</li>
  <li>full import controls and checks are in place on all products</li>
  <li>any physical checks on high priority plants or plant products will continue to be conducted at points of destination until July 2022</li>
