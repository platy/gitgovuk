<p>The government agreed to continue recognising <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> conformity assessment markings and documentation for some manufactured goods for a set period after 1 January 2021. This included a 2-year recognition period for interoperable rail products to support industry’s transition to the new domestic regulatory framework.</p>

<p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/placing-manufactured-goods-on-the-market-in-great-britain">announced on 20 June 2022</a> that a number of measures would be introduced to end recognition of <abbr title="Conformité Européenne">CE</abbr>-marked manufactured products from 1 January 2023, to support businesses in complying with the UK conformity assessment (<abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr>) requirements.</p>

<p>The government has decided to implement these easements for rail component products, known as interoperability constituents. The easements are intended to make it easier and less costly for businesses to comply with the UK conformity assessment product regime from 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>This technical notice sets out the policy of ending the recognition of <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> certification for interoperability constituents and subsystems and explains how the easements announced for <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> product sectors will apply in the context of rail.</p>

<p>This is only applicable to products for use in domestic rail services in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland requirements for standards and conformity assessments will align with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eudr/2016/797/contents" rel="external">Directive (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 2016/797</a>. Further guidance on Northern Ireland will be issued separately.</p>

<p>In addition, the government will introduce legislation to end the recognition of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> certificates issued to entities in charge of maintenance (<abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECMs</abbr>) with responsibility for freight wagons operating domestically in GB, from 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>For vehicles used in international services, the UK will continue to meet its obligations under the Convention concerning <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cit-rail.org/en/rail-transport-law/cotif/" rel="external">International Carriage by Rail (COTIF)</a>, which provides for recognition of some <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> conformity assessment documentation and <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECM</abbr> certification.</p>

<h2>Rail interoperability constituents and subsystems</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/3066/contents/made" rel="external">Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011 (<abbr title="Rail Interoperability Regulations">RIR</abbr> 2011)</a>, as amended by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/345/made" rel="external">Railways (Interoperability) (Amendment) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) 2019 Exit Regulations</a>, provide for the unilateral recognition of subsystems and interoperability constituents that have been assessed against <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> standards (Technical Specifications for Interoperability – TSIs) where there are no applicable UK specific cases in the corresponding GB standards <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/railway-interoperability-national-technical-specification-notices-ntsns/national-technical-specification-notices-ntsns">National Technical Specification Notices – <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSNs</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The government previously announced that the period of unilateral recognition of relevant documentation issued in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will be time-limited to 24 months (between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2022) for the purposes of placing an interoperability constituent on the market, or seeking an authorisation to place a subsystem into service. While <abbr title="Rail Interoperability Regulations">RIR</abbr> 2011 does not yet include an end date to recognition, the government will bring forward legislation to give effect to this deadline from 1 January 2023.</p>

<h3>1. Current requirements in <abbr title="Rail Interoperability Regulations">RIR</abbr> 2011 for placing interoperability constituents on the market with a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use</h3>

<p>A person intending to place an interoperability constituent on the market can only do so if a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use has been drawn up for it in accordance with Schedule 7 of <abbr title="Rail Interoperability Regulations">RIR</abbr> 2011. Depending on the interoperability constituent, this may require an assessment by a UK approved body that the interoperability constituent meets the relevant <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr> requirements for that interoperability constituent and, if applicable, an assessment by a UK designated body that the interoperability constituent meets any applicable UK specific case requirements. The person intending to place that interoperability constituent on the market (normally the manufacturer) can then draw up a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use on the basis of the examination certificates issued by the approved body and, if applicable, designated body.</p>

<h3>2. Current recognition of <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declarations of conformity or suitability for use for interoperability constituents</h3>

<p>Currently, interoperability constituents with an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use can be placed on the market where there are no UK specific cases applicable to that interoperability constituent.</p>

<p>Where there is a UK specific case in relation to an interoperability constituent, regulation 24(4) of <abbr title="Rail Interoperability Regulations">RIR</abbr> 2011 requires that an assessment of the conformity or suitability for use against the applicable UK specific case(s) is carried out by a designated body in accordance with the <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr> on assessment and further assessment of interoperability constituents (available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/railway-interoperability-national-technical-specification-notices-ntsns">here</a>).</p>

<p>This applies both to interoperability constituents with <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declarations of conformity or suitability for use and interoperability constituents that have been assessed in the UK by an approved body. The <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr> on assessment and further assessment of interoperability constituents sets out a process where a UK designated body must assess the conformity or suitability for use against the applicable UK specific case(s) and, if the assessment is positive, the manufacturer can then draw up a UK declaration of conformity for the purposes of placing the interoperability constituent on the GB market.</p>

<h3>3. New requirements from 1 January 2023: Ending recognition of <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declarations for interoperability constituents</h3>

<p>The government will introduce legislation so that, from 1 January 2023, a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use will be required to place an interoperability constituent on the GB market. It will no longer be possible to place an interoperability constituent on the GB market from this date with an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use.</p>

<p>The legislation will set out that interoperability constituents placed on the UK market before 1 January 2023 with an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use in accordance with regulation 23(2) of</p>

<p><abbr title="Rail Interoperability Regulations">RIR</abbr> 2011 can continue to be sold on the GB market. In addition, where that interoperability constituent is subsequently incorporated into a subsystem being authorised by the <abbr title="Office for Road and Rail">ORR</abbr> on or after 1 January 2023, that interoperability constituent should be presumed to meet the essential requirements that relate to an interoperability constituent of that type and conform to the applicable <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr>.</p>

<h3>4. Ending recognition of <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declarations of verification for subsystems</h3>

<p>Currently an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of verification drawn up on the basis of an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> certificate of verification is valid for the purposes of seeking an authorisation from the <abbr title="Office for Road and Rail">ORR</abbr>.</p>

<p>After 1 January 2023, a UK certificate of verification will be required in order to draw up a UK declaration of verification when seeking an authorisation to place into service from the <abbr title="Office for Road and Rail">ORR</abbr>. However, an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of verification that has been drawn up before 1 January 2023 will still be valid for this purpose.</p>

<p>Projects seeking an authorisation after 1 January 2023 may either engage a UK approved body to carry out the UK verification assessment procedure in order to issue a UK certificate of verification or, where an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body is already engaged, may rely on an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> certificate of verification and <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of verification that have been drawn up before 1 January 2023.</p>

<h3>5. Northern Ireland qualifying goods being placed on the market in GB</h3>

<p>To protect the integrity of the UK internal market and ensure products moving from NI to GB do not need to undergo additional checks, the government has a policy of unfettered access to NI goods being sold on the GB market. This means that while products placed on the market in NI will need to comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> product legislation (including standards and conformity assessment requirements), these products can be sold on the GB market without further checks. Therefore, an interoperability constituent that has been manufactured in NI and assessed according to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> conformity assessment procedures and accompanied with an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use can still be sold on the market in GB after 1 January 2023. In addition, interoperability constituents placed on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market which are then present in NI and are not subject to any customs supervision, restriction or control which does not arise from the goods being taken out of the territory of NI or the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, can also be sold into GB with no further checks or certification requirements.</p>

<h3>6. Easements in respect of the ending of recognition of <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declarations of conformity or suitability for use</h3>

<p>Further to the easements announced for some <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> product sectors, the government has announced a similar set of easements for rail interoperability constituents.</p>

<h3>6.1 Reducing re-testing costs for UK certification</h3>

<p>The government intends to introduce legislation which will allow completed conformity assessment activities carried out against <abbr title="Technical Specifications for Interoperability">TSI</abbr> requirements (including existing testing, certification, and contractual arrangements relating to the quality control or auditing of existing certificates) undertaken by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified bodies for the purposes of certifying interoperability constituents before 1 January 2023 to be used by manufacturers to declare existing product types compliant with the relevant <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSNs</abbr>. This will only be applicable where there are no relevant UK specific cases in the <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr> applicable to that type of interoperability constituent. Manufacturers must still draw up a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use on the basis of the examination certificate that was issued by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body before 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>This will allow manufacturers to draw up a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use without the involvement of a UK approved body and continue to place the interoperability constituent on the market, on the basis of the existing <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> type examination completed before 31 December 2022, for the lifetime of the certificate issued.</p>

<p>Where manufacturers are using existing <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> certification completed before 1 January 2023 as the basis to demonstrate compliance with the <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSNs</abbr> for interoperability constituents, the manufacturer should include in the UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use the list of relevant <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr>/<abbr title="Technical Specifications for Interoperability">TSI</abbr> relevant requirements that apply to the interoperability constituent, as well as details of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body (or notified body recognised under an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Mutual Recognition Agreement) which carried out the conformity assessment procedures.</p>

<p>Where there is a UK specific case in relation to the interoperability constituent, the examination certificate that was drawn up before 1 January 2023 by an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body in relation to that interoperability constituent can also be used, but a UK designated body must be engaged to carry out an assessment of the conformity or suitability for use against the applicable UK specific case(s) in accordance with the <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr> on assessment and further assessment of interoperability constituents. If the designated body’s assessment is positive, the person intending to place the interoperability constituent on the GB market can use the certificate issued by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body and the designated body’s positive assessment to draw up a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use in accordance with Schedule 7 of <abbr title="Rail Interoperability Regulations">RIR</abbr> 2011.</p>

<h3>6.2 Imported interoperability constituents</h3>

<p>The government will bring forward legislation to consider fully manufactured and conformity assessed interoperability constituents with <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declarations of conformity or suitability for use (where there are no applicable UK specific cases) which have been imported into GB (that is, are physically present) before 31 December 2022 as having already been ‘placed on the GB market’. Therefore, these interoperability constituents will not need to undergo re-testing and re-certification to UK requirements.</p>

<h3>6.3 Repair, refurbishment and exchange of existing interoperability constituents</h3>

<p>Interoperability constituents which are repaired, refurbished or exchanged without changing their original performance, purpose, or type or basic parameters, are not considered ‘new’ and therefore do not need to be recertified.</p>

<p>This includes if the interoperability constituent is temporarily exported for repair (as it is not being placed on the GB market for the first time when re-imported).</p>

<h2>Examples of various scenarios</h2>

<h4>A manufacturer has placed an interoperability constituent on the UK market with an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use before 1 January 2023.</h4>

<p>The interoperability constituent can continue to be sold on the GB market after 1 January 2023 with the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use. If the interoperability constituent is then purchased and incorporated into a subsystem, the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use is valid for the purposes of seeking an authorisation from the Safety Authority, provided the interoperability constituent is suitable for the rail environment in which it is intended to operate in (that is, it is used in accordance with its conditions of use).</p>

<h4>A manufacturer of an interoperability constituent with an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use drawn up before 1 January 2023 wants to place the interoperability constituent on the UK market after 1 January 2023.</h4>

<p>If there are no UK specific cases in relation to that interoperability constituent, and the examination certificate was issued by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body before 1 January 2023, the manufacturer can draw up a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use on the basis of the notified body’s certificate.</p>

<p>If the interoperability constituent is not subject to third-party conformity assessment (that is, the manufacturer is permitted to carry out a self-assessment), then the manufacturer can follow the process described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/railway-interoperability-national-technical-specification-notices-ntsns/national-technical-specification-notices-ntsns">Modules <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr></a> to draw up the UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use for the interoperability constituent.</p>

<p>If there is a UK specific case in relation to that interoperability constituent, and the examination certificate was issued by the notified body before 1 January 2023, the manufacturer will need to engage a UK designated body to carry out an assessment of the conformity or suitability for use against the applicable UK specific case(s) in accordance with the <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr> on assessment and further assessment of interoperability constituents. The certificate issued by the notified body can be used as evidence that the interoperability constituent meets the <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr> requirements, but a designated body will need to issue a certificate to confirm the interoperability constituent’s conformity or suitability for use against the UK specific case(s). The manufacturer can then draw up a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use on the basis of the notified body’s and designated body’s positive assessments.</p>

<h4>A manufacturer has imported an interoperability constituent with an <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use into the UK before 1 January 2023, but has not yet made it available for purchase.</h4>

<p>Provided the interoperability constituent was imported into the UK before 1 January 2023, and it meets the criteria set out in regulation 23(2) (a) or (b) of <abbr title="Rail Interoperability Regulations">RIR</abbr> 2011 (that is, there are no applicable UK specific cases that require a designated body assessment), the interoperability constituent is considered to have already been placed on the UK market and can continue to be sold with the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> declaration of conformity or suitability for use.</p>

<p>If there is an applicable UK specific case in relation to that interoperability constituent, then the manufacturer will need to engage a designated body to carry out an assessment of the conformity or suitability for use against the applicable UK specific case(s) in accordance with the <abbr title="National Technical Specification Notices">NTSN</abbr> on assessment and further assessment of interoperability constituents and follow the process for drawing up a UK declaration of conformity or suitability for use.</p>

<h4>A project seeking authorisation after 1 January 2023 has engaged a notified body to carry out the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> verification assessment procedure.</h4>

<p>If the notified body has issued the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> certificate of verification before 1 January 2023, then the project entity can use this to draw up a UK declaration of verification for the purposes of seeking an authorisation from the <abbr title="Office for Road and Rail">ORR</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the notified body has not issued the <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> certificate of verification before 1 January 2023, then the project entity will need to engage an approved body to carry out the UK verification assessment procedure in order to obtain a UK certificate of verification. The UK verification assessment procedure for subsystems set out in Schedule 4 of <abbr title="Rail Interoperability Regulations">RIR</abbr> 2011 requires the approved body responsible for the verification of the subsystem to take into account an intermediate statement of verification (<abbr title="Intermediate Statement of Verification">ISV</abbr>) issued by an approved body, an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body, or a designated body. It is, therefore, possible to take account of an <abbr title="Intermediate Statement of Verification">ISV</abbr> issued by an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body before 1 January 2023 as part of the UK verification assessment procedure.</p>

<h2>Entities in charge of maintenance</h2>

<p>The government will also bring forward legislation to end the recognition of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> certificates issued to entities in charge of maintenance (<abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECMs</abbr>) responsible for the ongoing maintenance of domestic freight wagons. <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECMs</abbr> play an important safety role by ensuring that the vehicles they maintain are kept in a safe state of running. All domestic rail vehicles are required to have an <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECM</abbr> assigned to them and <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECMs</abbr> with responsibility for freight wagons comply with an additional certification requirement. Since 31 December 2020, the UK has continued to recognise <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> certificates issued to <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECMs</abbr> for domestic and international rail vehicles and domestic freight wagons.</p>

<p>The UK is required to recognise <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECM</abbr> certificates for international traffic as it is a signatory of the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) and the government decided in 2019 to also recognise these for domestic operations to support the smooth continuation of domestic and international freight services.</p>

<p>The decision to end recognition of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECM</abbr> certificates domestically is consistent with the government’s policy to end recognition of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> certification, but will also implement an urgent recommendation made by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (<abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch">RAIB</abbr>) following their investigation into the freight derailment and fire at Llangennech in Wales on 26 August 2020 in their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/raib-reports/report-01-slash-2022-derailment-and-fire-at-llangennech">report</a> published in January 2022.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Rail Accident Investigation Branch">RAIB</abbr> report recommended that the Department and <abbr title="Office for Road and Rail">ORR</abbr> should jointly review the current arrangements for the oversight of entities in charge of maintenance that are not based in the UK.</p>

<p>To ensure the continued safety of the railway and to align with wider policy on ending the recognition of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> documentation, the government has taken the decision to end the recognition of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> certificates issued to <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECMs</abbr> responsible for the ongoing maintenance of domestic freight wagons from 1 January 2023. This does not apply in Northern Ireland where separate legislation applies.</p>

<p>The UK will continue to recognise <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> certificates held by <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECMs</abbr> assigned to international rail vehicles in accordance with its international obligations.</p>
