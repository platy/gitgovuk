<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>You must ensure that you meet all the eligibility criteria listed below. Our application form will ask you to demonstrate that this is the case.</p>

<h3>Nationality</h3>

<p>Departments recruiting under the legal trainee scheme are part of the wider Civil Service and therefore the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-rules">Civil Service nationality rules</a> apply.</p>

<p>As this post is described as ‘non-reserved’, those listed below will be eligible to apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals</li>
  <li>Nationals of Commonwealth countries</li>
  <li>Nationals of the Republic of Ireland</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> nationals with (or eligible for) status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)</li>
  <li>Relevant <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Turkish nationals working in the Civil Service</li>
  <li>Relevant <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Turkish nationals who have built up the right to work in the Civil Service</li>
  <li>Certain family members of the relevant EU &amp; Turkish nationals</li>
</ul>

<p>Guidance on the changes to the Civil Service nationality requirements can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/944044/Changes_to_the_Civil_Service_Nationality_Rules_from_1_January_2021_-_Guidance_and_departmental_actions.pdf" rel="external">here.</a></p>

<p>Please note that it is possible to meet the above nationality requirements and still not be legally entitled to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Newly arriving <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> nationals who enter the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from 1 January 2021 and their family members, who are not eligible to apply to the EUSS, will be subject to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know">new points-based immigration system</a>. As such, they will not be eligible to work in the Civil Service unless they are able to qualify under their own nationality (i.e. they are an Irish national).</p>

<p>It is the applicant’s responsibility to check whether they are legally entitled to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. When applying, applicants will be asked about their nationality at birth, whether they are subject to immigration control, whether there are any restrictions on your continued residence or employment in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> etc. Detailed document checks will be made prior to employment.</p>

<h3>Security Clearance</h3>

<p>Some departments require their trainees to have attained a higher level of security clearance, i.e. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels#security-check-sc">Security Check (SC)</a>, prior to starting their training. A prerequisite of this higher level of clearance is that you need to have lived in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for the last 5 years. Further information on clearance levels can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels">GOV.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Academic criteria</h3>

<p>You must have, or be predicted to obtain, a minimum of a 2:2 in an undergraduate degree. This does not have to be in law.</p>

<p>You are also eligible to apply if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>hold a Certificate of Academic Standing from the Bar Standards Board (<abbr title="Bar Standards Board">BSB</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sra.org.uk/become-solicitor/legal-practice-course-route/equivalent-means-information-pack/" rel="external">satisfied the Solicitors Regulation Authority’s (<abbr title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</abbr>) academic stage requirements via ‘equivalent means’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are a Fellow or Graduate Member of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.cilex.org.uk/" rel="external">Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx)</a>. You must have satisfied the academic stage requirements of the <abbr title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</abbr> or <abbr title="Bar Standards Board">BSB</abbr> through study or exemptions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are successful in obtaining a trainee position within one of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-legal-service-gls-legal-trainee-scheme-how-to-apply#introduction">participating department</a>, you must have successfully completed your undergraduate degree and the following postgraduate courses before joining that department:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Graduate Diploma in Law (<abbr title="Graduate Diploma in Law">GDL</abbr>) if you have a non-law degree and</li>
  <li>the Legal Practice Course (<abbr title="Legal Practice Course">LPC</abbr>) if you wish to join as a trainee solicitor, or</li>
  <li>the Bar training course if you wish to join as a pupil barrister</li>
</ul>

<h3>Degree stage</h3>

<p>If you are a non-law graduate or are a Scots law graduate, you are eligible to apply if before 1 September 2021, you completed, started, accepted an offer of a place or paid a non-refundable deposit for the Common Professional Examination (CPE) / Graduate Diploma in Law (<abbr title="Graduate Diploma in Law">GDL</abbr>). Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sra.org.uk/become-solicitor/legal-practice-course-route/transitional-arrangements/" rel="external"><abbr title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</abbr>’s Transitional Arrangements</a> for those looking to qualify as solicitors through the <abbr title="Legal Practice Course">LPC</abbr>/ training contract route.</p>

<p>If you are currently studying for a law degree, you are eligible to apply from the penultimate year of your degree.</p>

<p>We welcome applications from people who graduated some time ago as well as those newly graduating.</p>

<p>If you applied in previous years and met all the eligibility requirements, you can apply again.</p>

<p>You will not be asked to provide details of your GCSE and A-level results.</p>

<h3>Overseas degrees</h3>

<p>We accept applications from candidates with overseas degrees. You must supply evidence that their degree is equivalent to the minimum requirement of a 2:2 in an <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> undergraduate degree.</p>

<p>The responsibility (including any costs) of providing appropriate documentation is on the individual. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.naric.org.uk/naric/" rel="external">National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC)</a> provides information about the comparability of different international qualifications.</p>

<p>We would normally ask for evidence when candidates are completing the online application form and situational judgement test.</p>

<h2>Solicitors Qualifying Examination (<abbr title="Solicitor Qualifying Examination">SQE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>From September 2021, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (<abbr title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</abbr>) will introduce the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sra.org.uk/students/sqe/" rel="external">Solicitors Qualifying Examination (<abbr title="Solicitor Qualifying Examination">SQE</abbr>)</a> - an alternative route to qualification.</p>

<p>We are not currently offering the <abbr title="Solicitor Qualifying Examination">SQE</abbr> route to qualification.</p>

<h2>What we look for</h2>

<p>Factors such as the school you attended, A levels and GCSEs results, your university and degree subject do not form part of our decision-making process.</p>

<p>In fact, the only time that we see any personal information about you is at the assessment centre stage and this is limited to your name and any work experience.</p>

<p>This approach has delivered positive results. In the 2021 Legal Trainee Scheme, the 56 successful candidates came from 34 different universities.</p>

<p>The type of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/success-profiles">skills and behaviours</a> we are looking for and how we test them are below.</p>

</ol>

<h3>Situational judgement test (<abbr title="Situational Judgement Test">SJT</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Situational Judgement Test">SJT</abbr> assesses your judgement in dealing with the types of situations you may encounter as a legal trainee. If you pass the eligibility criteria in the application form, you will then receive an email inviting you to complete the <abbr title="Situational Judgement Test">SJT</abbr>.</p>

<p>You will be given 16 hypothetical situations and a list of possible reactions to each situation. You will be asked to indicate which reaction you think would be the most effective response and least effective response to the situation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Situational Judgement Test">SJT</abbr> is conducted online. The test is not timed but should take between 25 to 30 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>A free practice test can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.testpartnership.com/free/critical/1/" rel="external">Test Partnership website.</a></p>

<p>If you obtain the pass mark for the <abbr title="Critical Reasoning Test">CRT</abbr>, we will invite you to complete a Video Interview.</p>

<h3>Video interview (VIV)</h3>

<p>The video interview has been designed to assess candidates’ motivations for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-legal-service-gls-legal-trainee-scheme-how-to-apply">trainee scheme</a>, as well as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-legal-service-gls-legal-trainee-scheme-how-to-apply--2#what-we-look-for">some of the behaviours</a> which are integral to the role.</p>

<p>During the interview, there will be a number of text-based questions, and a set amount of time to respond to each of those questions.</p>

<p>The interview will last for approximately 20 minutes, and full instructions on how to complete this will be given at the time.</p>

<p>A free practice test can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.assessmentday.co.uk/video-interviews.htm" rel="external">AssessmentDay website.</a></p>

<p>If you obtain the pass mark in the video interview and are amongst the highest scoring candidates, we will invite you to attend an assessment centre.</p>

<h2>Assessment stage</h2>

<p>If you are invited to the half-day assessment centre, the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:govtrainees@tmpw.co.uk">Recruitment Team</a> will email you asking you to book your preferred date, so you should book your place as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The assessment centres will only run on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-legal-service-gls-legal-trainee-scheme-how-to-apply--2#timetable">dates published (11 to 25 July 2022)</a>. No further dates will be made available. If you cannot make any of the assessment centre dates then, unfortunately, your application will be withdrawn from the recruitment process.</p>

<p>The assessment centre will be conducted online using Zoom and Tazio. If you are invited to the assessment centres you must have access to video with audio capability on your laptop, tablets etc. If you do not have access then, unfortunately, your application will be withdrawn from the recruitment process.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:govtrainees@tmpw.co.uk">Recruitment Team</a> will provide you with our information pack about the assessment centre, which will help you to prepare for this stage of the process.</p>

<p>There will also be a conference call for those invited to the assessment centre. This will provide an opportunity to ask any questions on the assessment centre process and to hear from members of the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:govtrainees@tmpw.co.uk">Recruitment Team</a> and representatives from the Government Legal Profession.</p>

<p>You will be given the opportunity to indicate your preferred department which will be considered (but not guaranteed) by the Final Selection Board.</p>

<p>At the assessment centre you will complete a written exercise and take part in a panel interview.</p>

<h3>Written exercise</h3>

<p>You will have 60 minutes to complete the written exercise.</p>

<p>The exercise is not a test of legal knowledge and is designed with non-law students in mind.</p>

<p>You will be given a practical, legally-based problem which you will be asked to analyse and then address a number of questions.</p>

<p>You will be asked to assume that you are writing to a senior colleague who has asked for your advice. We will provide you with the necessary information about the law to which you need to refer in order to provide your advice.</p>

<h3>Interview</h3>

<p>The interview typically lasts around 70 minutes. The panel will usually consist of two senior lawyers and an independent chairperson.</p>

<p>The panel will use different types of questioning during the interview, which may require a slightly different approach to answering.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the interview, the panel will spend up to 15 minutes questioning the candidate on their response to the written exercise. This will enable them to expand upon the key points which they have made.</p>

<p>There will be a  ‘behaviour-based’ element to the interview because how you would behave in certain situations is one of the best indicators of how you are likely to perform in the role.</p>

<p>The types of behaviours which will result in effective performance in the trainee role are set out in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-legal-service-gls-legal-trainee-scheme-how-to-apply--2#what-we-look-for">person specification</a>. These behaviours link to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/success-profiles">Civil Service Success Profiles Framework</a>.</p>

<p>The examples the candidate chooses can be from any setting such as work, education, voluntary sector or home life.  Ideally they should use a different example for each question as a spread of responses will give the assessors the most comprehensive picture of them.</p>

<p>In their responses to the questions, candidates should try to include each of the following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Situation and/or task: briefly describe what the situation/task was</li>
  <li>Actions: what was it that they did?</li>
  <li>Result: describe the impact, outcomes or results of the actions they took</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, candidates may be asked how they would behave in a given situation. The panel members will set out a scenario for them to consider. For example, how they would respond to a heavy workload or manage a sensitive situation.</p>

<h3>Strengths Based Questions</h3>

<p>There will be some strength based questions. Strength based questions are designed to assess whether the candidate is a good fit for an organisation and role. This is based on what they enjoy doing and what they do well and often. By ensuring the role is the right fit for them, they are more likely to enjoy it and perform well.</p>

<p>A few generic examples of  strengths based questions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“What energises you?”</li>
  <li>“What are you good at?”</li>
  <li>”What would you say are your weaknesses?”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>Lastly, and unsurprisingly, the panel will focus on motivation for the role. The panel will be looking to understand the candidate’s reasons for applying to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-legal-service-gls-legal-trainee-scheme-how-to-apply">legal trainee scheme</a>. For example through their knowledge of what government lawyers do and their motivation for working within the public sector.</p>

<h2>Candidates with a disability</h2>

<p>We believe that all eligible people must have equality of opportunity for employment and advancement on the basis of their suitability for the work.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010">Equality Act 2010</a> requires us to provide reasonable adjustments for disabled people.</p>

<p>This is defined by the Act as those who have a physical or mental impairment. For example a substantial and long-term adverse effect on that person’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.</p>

<p>We will not make assumptions about whether a disabled person requires any adjustments or about what those adjustments should be.</p>

<p>We will discuss and agree with the individual in question the reasonable adjustments required.</p>

<p>If you are a disabled person as defined by the Equality Act 2010, then you must notify the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:govtrainees@tmpw.co.uk">Recruitment Team</a> in the application form. This must be submitted by the stated deadline. You must include any reasonable adjustments you may need. For example, additional time for the timed online tests and any adjustments at the assessment centre.</p>

<p>If you require a reasonable adjustment to complete your application form and/or situational judgement test you will need to contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:govtrainees@tmpw.co.uk">Recruitment Team</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you would find it helpful to discuss your requirements, please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:govtrainees@tmpw.co.uk">Recruitment Team.</a></p>

<p>Any information given in support of your request will be treated in confidence and withheld from those involved in selection based decisions.</p>

<h3>Monitoring</h3>

<p>We will record and monitor the reasonable adjustments that have been requested and made. This will help us identify whether there are any wider steps that we can take to support those applying to us with a disability.</p>

<h2>Disability Confident scheme</h2>

<p>Departments recruiting under the legal trainee scheme have signed up to the Disability Confident scheme.</p>

<p>If you consider yourself to have a disability <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010">as defined by the Equality Act 2010</a>, you can apply under the terms of the scheme.</p>

<p>We will invite you to attend the assessment centre if you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meet all aspects of the eligibility criteria</li>
  <li>Meet the standard in each of the 3 online tests and video interview</li>
</ol>

<h2>Complaints procedure</h2>

<p>The legal trainee scheme is underpinned by the principle of selection for appointment on merit on the basis of fair and open competition. This is outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk" rel="external">Civil Service Commission’s Recruitment Principles</a>.</p>

<p>We aim to provide the best possible service to applicants for to the legal trainee scheme. If you are not satisfied with any aspect of the service you have received during the process, please contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:govtrainees@tmpw.co.uk">Recruitment Team</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not feel that your application has been treated in accordance with the Commission’s Recruitment Principles and wish to make a complaint, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:caroline.anerville@governmentlegal.gov.uk">Caroline Anerville</a>, Government Legal Department, 102 Petty France, London SW1H 9GL.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the response you receive, you may then wish to contact the Civil Service Commission. Please submit any complaint in writing.</p>

<h2>Civil Service Code</h2>

<p>As civil servants, legal trainees will be appointed on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.</p>

<p>Legal trainees will be expected to carry out their role with dedication and a commitment to the Civil Service and its core values: integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘integrity’ is putting the obligations of public service above your own personal interests</li>
  <li>‘honesty’ is being truthful and open</li>
  <li>‘objectivity’ is basing your advice and decisions on rigorous analysis of the evidence</li>
  <li>‘impartiality’ is acting solely according to the merits of the case and serving equally well governments of different political persuasions</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code">The core values are set out in the Civil Service Code.</a></p>

<h2>Overseas lawyers</h2>

<p>If you are a foreign qualified lawyer, you may be able to re-qualify to practise in England and Wales through an alternative route (instead of applying through the <abbr title="legal trainee scheme">LTS</abbr>). Further information is available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/qlts/" rel="external">Solicitors Regulation Authority (<abbr title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</abbr>)</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/training-qualification/becoming-a-barrister/transferring-lawyers.html" rel="external">Bar Standards Board (<abbr title="Bar Standards Board">BSB</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h2>Professional bodies’ requirements</h2>

<p>If you are successful in obtaining a training contract or pupillage, please ensure that you understand the requirements placed on you by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sra.org.uk/become-solicitor/qualified-lawyers/" rel="external">Solicitors Regulation Authority (<abbr title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</abbr>)</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/qualifying-as-a-barrister/becoming-a-barrister/" rel="external">Bar Standards Board (<abbr title="Bar Standards Board">BSB</abbr>)</a></p>

<p>For example, as a trainee solicitor you must ensure, before starting your training contract, that you meet the <abbr title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</abbr>’s character and suitability requirements.</p>

<p>If you identify any potential issues in terms of being able to meet these requirements, e.g. a criminal conviction, you must notify the <abbr title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</abbr>. This must be a least 6 months before your training starts. You must complete and submit to the <abbr title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</abbr> an eligibility form which is available on their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sra.org.uk/become-solicitor/" rel="external">website.</a></p>
