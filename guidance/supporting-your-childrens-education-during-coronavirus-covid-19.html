<p>We know this is a challenging time for parents, carers and children. Remote education has brought new demands for them and changed how they engage with schools. Many parents and carers are balancing various responsibilities while supporting their children with education at home.</p>

<p>Schools and colleges are there to support you and your children in this.</p>

<p>Separate advice is available for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/help-children-aged-2-to-4-to-learn-at-home-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">parents and carers of early years children who have not yet started school</a>.</p>

<h2>What you should expect for your child’s remote education</h2>

<p>Schools and colleges have been working hard to deliver high quality remote education. They are now expected to publish information about their remote education offer on their websites. This will help you to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what your child will be studying at home</li>
  <li>how you can support your child to engage with their remote curriculum</li>
</ul>

<p>The remote education that schools provide should be equivalent in length to the teaching your child would normally get in school. You should expect this to include a mixture of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recorded or live direct teaching time</li>
  <li>time for pupils to complete activities independently, such as working through assignments, <abbr title="physical education">PE</abbr> or reading in a comfortable space</li>
</ul>

<p>Remote education should be suitably tailored if your child has special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>).</p>

<p>The amount of remote education should be a minimum of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>key stage 1 – 3 hours a day, on average across the cohort, with fewer hours for younger children</li>
  <li>key stage 2 – 4 hours a day</li>
  <li>key stages 3 and 4 – 5 hours a day</li>
</ul>

<p>Schools should also have a system in place to check pupils’ engagement with work on a daily basis. Schools can decide how this will take place. It could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monitoring pupils’ attendance at live or recorded lessons</li>
  <li>checking that pupils have understood and completed their work</li>
  <li>direct contact with pupils</li>
</ul>

<p>Colleges are expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to deliver as much of students’ planned hours as possible</li>
  <li>provide students with regular feedback on their progress</li>
  <li>as far as possible, provide students with live online teaching in place of face-to-face delivery</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do have concerns about the remote education being provided by your child’s school or college, please discuss these first with the classroom teacher and if necessary, the headteacher or senior leader. If, having done so, you remain concerned, you can approach Ofsted.</p>

<p>More information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-parents-and-carers-need-to-know-about-early-years-providers-schools-and-colleges-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">what parents and carers need to know about early years providers, schools and colleges</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Supporting your child during remote education</h2>

<p>Parents and carers should not feel that they need to set work for their child.</p>

<p>However, the resources below can help you plan your child’s days during this period. These resources may also be useful for pupils and students to use alongside the work provided by their school or college.</p>

<p>If you need further support, we encourage you to speak to your child’s school or college about their remote education offer.</p>

<h3>Engaging children at home</h3>
