<h2>Overview of the Ofsted <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>:</h2>

<p>This guide is for primary and secondary schools including those with a sixth form.</p>

<p>The Ofsted <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> is now a web-based page showing data for Ofsted inspectors to use when preparing for and during inspection. The <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> is designed to align with our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif">school inspection handbook</a>, so that areas of interest can be used to identify inspection trails.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> can contain sensitive information about schools and colleges. It is your responsibility to ensure that the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> is stored and shared appropriately.

<h2>Ofsted <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> 2022</h2>

<p>As outlined in the school inspection handbook, inspectors will gather evidence of the impact of the quality of education from various sources. This includes nationally generated performance information about pupils’ progress and attainment. The <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> can only provide a starting point, however. Inspectors want to see first-hand the quality of education as experienced by pupils and understand how well leaders know what it is like to be a pupil at the school.</p>

<p>Supporting data tables  used for the 2022 IDSR show national figures and quintile boundaries used to determine whether areas of interest sentences are triggered. To determine the quintile, the data for each school is percentile ranked from 1 to 100. If the score is in percentile 1 this is the highest rank. If the score is in percentile 100 this is the lowest rank. Then the ranks are grouped into 5 quintiles. Ranks 1-20 are in quintile 1, ranks 21-40 are in quintile 2 and so on. The quintile boundaries document shows which scores fall within each quintile.</p>

<p>The school sixth form sections of the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> includes 2019 revised and final Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) school and college performance tables data. Value-added, attainment and English and mathematics progress measures are based on revised data. Final data is used for retention and completion and attainment measures. The destinations measures have now been updated with the revised data for destinations of students in the academic year 2018 to 2019, which was released by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> in January 2022.</p>

<h2>Predecessor or successor link</h2>

<p>If applicable, the Ofsted <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> service will provide a link to a predecessor or successor provider to view. Some providers with a predecessor will not have a link. This is because it was decided to not include predecessors where there was no data on the predecessor school.</p>

<h2>School details</h2>

<p>The school details information at the beginning of the report comes from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">‘Get information about schools (<abbr title="Get information about schools">GIAS</abbr>)’</a> service. This data is correct as of the release date on the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Report information</h2>

<p>The Ofsted <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> will always show which release of performance data the report is based on. It will also show the date that the report was last released. 
For example:
Release information: Final 2019 <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, Provisional 2019 Phonics, Provisional 2019 KS1, Revised 2019 KS2, Revised 2019 KS4, Revised 2019 KS5</p>

<p>Release date: 28 February 2022</p>

<h2>Areas of interest</h2>

<p>The areas of interest in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> are sentences providing inspectors with interpretation of a school’s historical data. A sentence may be triggered by high or low performance, either across 3 years, the last 2 years or in the latest year. Similarly, we generate sentences for absences and exclusions when data is particularly high or low. Some sentences describe the data, such as those relating to the reasons for permanent exclusions.</p>

<p>Please note: areas of interest sentences are shown in grey and italics (not triggered) when there is not something significant to note, the criteria have not been met for a minimum of the latest year, or data relates to a small cohort. For progress and attainment, this is confirmed on the ‘Progress and attainment trend’ section of your <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>. The school’s data is in either in quintile 1 and highlighted in green or quintile 5 and highlighted in red (for at least the latest year) to trigger a sentence which is not grey. These grey sentences are included to show inspectors that the data has been analysed, but that the historical data is not an area of interest.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>For the whole school, there is nothing significant or exceptional to highlight for total suspensions compared to either all schools or schools with a similar level of deprivation in 2019/20, therefore no conclusions can be drawn from this data.</p>
</div>

<p>As mentioned, sentences are not produced when the cohorts are very small, namely cohorts of 10 or fewer. Sentences about permanent exclusions will appear for every school, regardless of cohort size.</p>

<p>Schools are ranked against other state funded (excluding special schools) schools with a valid school level value. For some measures, ranking has not been possible because there are not enough distinct values across all schools to produce adequate ranks (1–100). For example, this may happen when looking at low prior attainment because there may be fewer values to rank for some measures.</p>

<h2>Subjects</h2>

<h3>Subject entries at key stage 4 - 2021</h3>

<p>These subject sentences relate to the entry into subjects in 2021. There may be some differences between 2021 entries and earlier years. For example, in 2021 early entries are not included but are included for earlier years.</p>

<h3>Average number of qualifications</h3>

<p>This sentence describes the average number of qualifications that the school has entered pupils for. It covers the data for the latest year.</p>

<p>These criteria are applied to the data to determine the average number of qualifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only entries for qualifications included in KS4 performance tables are counted</li>
  <li>only summer 2021 entries are counted</li>
  <li>qualifications that pupils are entered for, but do not have a Teacher Assessed Grade recorded are not counted</li>
  <li>only entries for pupils deemed to be at the end of key stage 4 (Year 11) are counted</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The average number of key stage 4 qualifications that pupils were entered for in 2021 was 8.</p>
</div>

<h3>Subject clusters</h3>

<p>This sentence describes how many of the available subject clusters the school has entered pupils for, based on 2021 entries data.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The school entered pupils into 13 of the 16 available key stage 4 subject clusters in 2021.</p>
</div>

<h3>English Baccalaureate entry</h3>

<p>This sentence describes EBacc entry rate for 2021 based on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/schools-by-type/2021?step=default&amp;table=schools&amp;region=all-england&amp;for=secondary" rel="external">published 2021 performance data</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The subjects of the EBacc form a strong academic foundation for the key stage 4 curriculum. The EBacc entry rate in this school in 2021 was 53%. The subject that appears to be the greatest barrier to more pupils studying the EBacc is languages (51%).</p>
</div>

<h3>Subject attainment and progress at key stage 4 - 2019 and earlier</h3>

<p>These subject sentences relate to the attainment of and entry into subjects in 2019 and earlier.</p>

<h3>Average number of qualifications</h3>

<p>This sentence will appear for all schools with pupils at key stage 4, except for special schools. It describes the average number of qualifications that the school has entered pupils for. It covers the data for the latest 3 years. Calculations are based on the GCSE size equivalence, not the number of grades awarded. This means that double award qualifications, such as combined science, count as a single programme of study even though pupils receive 2 grades. For more information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-4-qualifications-discount-codes-and-point-scores"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> key stage 4 qualifications, discount codes and point scores</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The average number of key stage 4 qualifications that pupils were entered for in 2019 was 9. This was in line with 2018 (9) and 2017 (9).</p>
</div>

<h3>Subject clusters</h3>

<p>This is based on the subject families and clusters shown in Table 1. It describes how many of the available subject clusters, based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-4-qualifications-discount-codes-and-point-scores"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> approved key stage 4 qualifications</a>, the school has entered pupils for, based on 2019 examination data.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The school entered pupils into 12 of the 17 available key stage 4 subject clusters in 2019.</p>
</div>

<h3>English Baccalaureate entry</h3>

<p>The English Baccalaureate (EBacc) is a set of subjects at GCSE that keeps young people’s options open for further study and future careers. The EBacc requires pupils to have studied English language and literature, mathematics, the sciences, geography or history, and a language. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-baccalaureate-ebacc/english-baccalaureate-ebacc">further guidance about the EBacc</a>.</p>

<p>The EBacc entry data is calculated using early entry and discounting rules. This means that pupils who entered EBacc subjects in 2020 will have those entries counted towards their EBacc entry rate in 2021. The subject entries data, however, only includes subjects entered in 2021.</p>

<p>A sentence is produced for every school where there were at least 11 pupils. This describes the EBacc entry rate for the school in 2019. It also notes the subject area with the lowest rate of EBacc entry, where the rate is below 75%. This could be either English, mathematics, science, humanities or languages.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The subjects of the EBacc form a strong academic foundation for the key stage 4 curriculum. The EBacc entry rate in this school in 2019 was 41%. The subject that appears to be the greatest barrier to more pupils studying the EBacc is languages (47%).</p>
</div>

<h3>EBacc subject level average point scores</h3>

<p>Sentences describe the performance of the school in relation to other schools in terms of EBacc subjects. It is based on the subject families shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#table-1">‘Table 1’</a> above. It will appear if the average point score for pupils in a particular subject is in the highest or lowest 20% of all schools. It will only appear if entry levels were at or above national entries. It will list the subjects when there is more than one. The average point score is shown in brackets.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>For the following EBacc subject(s), the average point score was in the highest 20% of schools nationally and the proportion of entries was at or above the national average: double science (4.9).</p>
</div>

<h3>Non-EBacc subject level average point scores</h3>

<p>Sentences describe the performance of the school in relation to other schools in terms of subjects outside of the EBacc. It is based on the subject families shown in in <a class="govuk-link" href="#table-1">‘Table 1’</a> above. It will appear if the average point score for pupils in a particular subject is in the highest or lowest 20% of all schools. It will only appear if entry levels were at or above national entries. It will list the subjects when there is more than one. The average point score is shown in brackets.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>For the following subject(s) outside of the EBacc, the average point score was in the lowest 20% of schools nationally and the proportion of entries was at or above the national average: engineering (3.3).</p>
</div>

<h3>EBacc value added</h3>

<p>Value added is a measure of progress, like Progress 8. This means that pupils’ results are compared to the progress of other pupils nationally with similar starting points. EBacc value added measures are calculated for science, languages and humanities. This sentence will show whether there is high or low performance in value added in the latest year or across time. High or low performance is measured using statistical significance tests and percentile rank</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Value added in science (0.9), languages (0.7) and humanities (1.0) was significantly above the national average and in the highest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018 and 2017.</p>
</div>

<h3>EBacc attainment of grade 4 or higher</h3>

<p>EBacc attainment measures are calculated for science, languages and humanities. This sentence will show whether there is high or low attainment of grade 4 or above in the latest year or across time. High or low performance is measured using percentile rank.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The percentage achieving grade 4+ in science (81.8%) was in the highest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018 and 2017.</p>
</div>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data so sentences based on only the latest 2 years, or the latest year are shown.</p>

<h3>Early entry in English</h3>

<p>Sentences may appear if pupils were entered early, in Year 10, for either English literature or language. This is calculated based on 2019 examination data. A sentence will only appear when both 80% or more of the cohort were entered and there were more than 10 entries for the qualification entered in Year 10.</p>

<p>A sentence will also be generated when the percentage of pupils achieving grade 4 or above in English language is at least 2 standard deviations higher than the percentage of pupils achieving grade 4 or above in English literature, or vice versa.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>In 2019, the school entered around 95% of pupils for English literature in Year 10. In 2019, achievement of grade 4 or above in English language was much higher than in English literature.</p>
</div>

<h3>Subject entries at key stage 5 – 2021</h3>

<p>These subject sentences relate to the entry into subjects in 2021. We did not have any entries or attainment data for 2020.</p>

<p>Separate sentences will be generated for A level, applied general, other academic and technical level qualifications where applicable. The sentence states how many subjects the school offered pupils and how many subject clusters these covered from the total available. It then lists the subject clusters and the number of subjects in brackets.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>In 2021 the sixth form offered 13 A level subject(s) across 8 of the 13 subject clusters: Art &amp; design (1), Business, administration &amp; finance (1), English (1), Humanities (2), Mathematics &amp; statistics (1), Media (1), Science (4), Social studies (2).</p>
</div>

<h3>Subject progress at key stage 5 - 2019 and earlier</h3>

<p>There can be multiple sentences if your provider fits the criteria of each sentence.
Each sentence outlined below will only appear if they have ‘triggered’ for your provider.
A sentence will flag when there is consistently significant high or low progress in the same subject for the last 2 years, or when there is significantly very low progress in the latest year based on statistical significance and percentile rank.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The value-added score for qualifications of A level size and above was significantly above the national average in both 2018 and 2019 for the following subjects: Maths.</p>
</div>

<p>The Department for Education supply the source data for this section.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<h3>Progress at key stage 4</h3>

<p>There can be multiple sentences under each heading if your school fits the criteria of each sentence.</p>

<h3>Low or high performance</h3>

<p>This sentence will show when there is high or low performance in Progress 8 and its elements: English, mathematics, EBacc and open. High or low performance is measured using statistical significance tests and percentile rank. Sentences will be triggered if the progress score for all pupils is in the bottom or top quintile and the score is significantly different to the national score. The sentence will also identify a trend of low or high performance by checking the latest 3 years, 2 years or only the latest year. This is based on the distribution of scores for all pupils and when cohorts were more than 10 for each of the years.</p>

<p>The progress score for the latest year is in brackets.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Overall Progress 8 (0.8) was significantly above the national average and in the highest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018 and 2017.</p>
</div>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data, so sentences based on only the latest 2 years, or the latest year are shown.</p>

<h3>Key stage 4: Progress 8 trend analysis</h3>

<p>A sentence shows when there has been a fall or increase in Progress 8 score. This sentence will flag when there was a drop or increase between 2017 and 2018, or 2018 and 2019. This will align with arrows shown on the progress trend charts.</p>

<p>Progress is a relative measure, and the national average will always be very close to 0. Progress scores are not directly comparable year on year as they do not compare the cohorts with each other. For example, if all the pupils in 2019 generally made more progress than those in 2018, a comparison of progress scores would not show this improvement.</p>

<p>To allow for direct comparisons, every progress score is standardised using the formula shown in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#understanding-IDSR">‘Understanding the data in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>’</a> section. A sentence will appear if the standardised score has changed by more than 0.5 (half a grade) and the quintile position has changed by more than 1 quintile. This is referred to as markedly higher or lower in the legend of the progress and attainment trend chart. Note that this is not based on statistical significance testing.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>English Progress 8 has improved between 2018 and 2019.</p>
</div>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data, so sentences based on only the latest 2 years, or the latest year are shown.</p>

<h3>Progress at key stage 5</h3>

<p>There can be multiple sentences if your provider fits the criteria of each sentence.
Each sentence outlined below will only appear if they have ‘triggered’ for your provider.
A sentence will flag when there is consistently significant high or low progress in A level, AS level or applied general qualifications for the last 2 years, or when there is significantly higher or lower progress in the latest year based on statistical significance and percentile rank.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The value-added score for AS level was significantly below the national average and in the lowest 20% in both 2018 and 2019.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>In 2019 the value-added score was significantly below the national average and in the lowest 10% in A level and applied general.</p>
</div>

<h2>Attainment</h2>

<h3>Attainment at key stage 4</h3>

<p>A sentence will flag when there is high or low attainment of overall Attainment 8 and each of the Attainment 8 elements: English, mathematics, EBacc and open. The sentence will appear for the latest 3 years, 2 years or only the latest year, based on percentile rank. The score for each of the measures flagged will appear for the latest year in brackets.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Overall Attainment 8 (37) was in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018.</p>
</div>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data, so sentences based on only the latest 2 years or the latest year are shown.</p>

<h3>Attainment at key stage 5</h3>

<p>This section includes sentences based on average point scores and completion and attainment scores.</p>

<p>A sentence will flag for a particular qualification type when the provider’s attainment score is in the highest or lowest 20% in both 2018 and 2019. A sentence will also flag for a particular qualification type if the attainment score is in the highest or lowest 10% in the current year.</p>

<p>Best 3 A levels applies to the subset of A level students who entered at least one full size A level (this includes double award A levels, and applied A levels, but does not include AS levels, general studies or critical thinking). If students are entered for less than three full size A levels, they are only included in the measure if they have not entered for other academic, applied general and tech level qualifications greater than or equal to the size of an A level. Where a student has only been at a school or college for one year, they need to have entered three A levels to be included.</p>

<p>For completion and attainment sentences will flag when there is consistently high or low progress in tech level (L3) qualifications or technical certificates (L2).</p>

<p>The Department for Education supply the source data for this section.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentences</strong></p>

<p>The average point score per entry in A level was in the highest 20% in both 2018 and 2019.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentences</strong></p>

<p>The average point score per entry in A level was in the lowest 10% in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Example sentences</strong></p>

<p>The completion and attainment score in technical certificate (L2) was in the highest 20% in both 2018 and 2019.</p>
</div>

<h2>English and mathematics re-sits</h2>

<p>If a sixth form has students that did not achieve a grade 4 in English or mathematics at key stage 4, then a sentence will appear to show this cohort number. A subsequent sentence will also appear to show how many of this cohort did a resit in this subject.</p>

<p>Two further sentences may appear regarding the proportion of students achieving a grade 4 or above and the percentage that improved their grade, if the cohort was greater than 10 and the proportion was significant when compared to the national value.</p>

<p>The improvement of grade is any improvement regardless of whether the student reached grade 4.</p>

<p>The Department for Education supply the source data for this section.</p>

<h2>Progress: reading, writing and mathematics</h2>

<p>Under each subject heading, the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> groups sentences by key stage where applicable.</p>

<p>There can be multiple sentences under each heading if your school fits the criteria of each sentence.</p>

<h3>Progress at key stage 2</h3>

<p>For primary schools, the only progress measure available measures progress from key stage 1 to key stage 2.</p>

<h3>Low or high performance</h3>

<p>These sentences show when there is high or low performance for progress in reading, writing or mathematics, based on statistical significance tests and percentile rank. Sentences will flag if the progress score for all pupils is in the bottom or top quintile for the latest 3 years, 2 years or just the latest year and the score is significantly different to the national score. This is based on the distribution of scores for all pupils and when cohorts were more than 10 for each of the years. The progress score for the latest year is in brackets. If the latest 3 years sentence is not flagged, a sentence will appear if the all pupil group is in the bottom/top quintile for the latest 2 years.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentences</strong></p>

<p>Key stage 2 progress in reading (-5.1) was significantly below the national score and in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2017, 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>Key stage 2 progress in reading (-4.9) was significantly below the national score and in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018.</p>

<p>Key stage 2 progress in reading (-5.4) was significantly below the national score and in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2019.</p>
</div>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data so sentences based on only the latest 2 years, or the latest year are shown.</p>

<h3>Progress trend analysis</h3>

<p>A sentence shows when there has been a fall or increase in progress score. This sentence will flag when there was a drop or increase between 2017 and 2018, or 2018 and 2019. This will align with arrows shown on the progress trend charts.</p>

<p>Progress is a relative measure, and the national average will always be very close to 0. Progress scores are not directly comparable year on year as they do not compare the cohorts with each other. For example, if all the pupils in 2019 generally made more progress than those in 2018, a comparison of progress scores would not show this improvement.</p>

<p>To allow for direct comparisons, every progress score is standardised using the formula shown in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#understanding-IDSR">‘Understanding the data in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>’</a> section. A sentence will appear if the standardised score has changed by more than 1 and the quintile position has changed by more than 1.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Reading progress has improved between 2018 and 2019.</p>
</div>

<h2>Attainment: reading, writing and mathematics</h2>

<p>The following guidance is applicable to primary schools only.</p>

<p>There can be multiple sentences under each heading if your school fits the criteria of each sentence.</p>

<h3>Attainment at key stage 2</h3>

<p>A sentence will flag when there is high or low attainment of the expected standard for each subject for the latest 3 years, 2 years or just the latest year, based on statistical significance and percentile rank. It will also flag the number of pupils who did not meet the expected standard in the latest year and, where there are more than 10 pupils not meeting the expected standard and who have a scaled score, the average scaled score of those pupils.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Key stage 2 attainment of the expected standard (100+) in mathematics (39%) was significantly below national and in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018 and 2017. Of the 38 pupils in 2019, 23 did not meet the expected standard. 19 of these pupils had a score, with an average scaled score of 84.</p>
</div>

<p>A different sentence will appear when there is significant high or low attainment of the high standard in reading or mathematics. A sentence will also show when there is significant high or low attainment of greater depth in writing.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Key stage 2 attainment of the high standard (110+) in reading (2%) was significantly below national in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018 and 2017.</p>
</div>

<p>If both the expected standard and high/greater depth sentence flag for both high or low attainment for the same subject, the sentence will be combined.</p>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data so sentences based on only the latest 2 years, or the latest year are shown.</p>

<p>A sentence will appear for reading and mathematics when the 3-year combined average key stage 2 attainment score was in the highest or lowest 20% of all schools.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The 3-year average reading attainment score (102.1) was in the lowest 20%.</p>
</div>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data so no sentence for 3-year average will be displayed.</p>

<h3>Attainment at key stage 1</h3>

<p>A sentence will flag when there is significant high or low attainment of the expected standard for each subject for the latest 3 years, 2 years or just the latest year, based on statistical significance and percentile rank.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Key stage 1 attainment of the expected standard (30%) in reading was significantly below national and in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as 2018 and 2017.</p>
</div>

<p>A different sentence will flag if there is low attainment of greater depth for each subject.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Key stage 1 attainment of greater depth (3%) in reading was significantly below national in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as 2018 and 2017.</p>
</div>

<p>If both the expected standard and greater depth sentence flag for both significant high or low attainment for the same subject, the sentence will be combined.</p>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data so sentences based on only the latest 2 years, or the latest year are shown.</p>

<h3>Attainment in phonics</h3>

<p>A sentence for phonics will only appear under the reading subject section and will flag when there is significant high or low attainment of the expected standard for the latest 3 years, 2 years or just the latest year, based on statistical significance and percentile rank. If the sentence has been triggered due to the school being below national and in the lowest 20%, an additional sentence will be displayed showing the total number of pupils and how many of them did not meet the expected standard. When applicable, it will also display how many did not sit the test (those whose outcome was recorded as either absent, maladministration, disapplied or left).</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The proportion of pupils who met the expected standard (32+) in phonics in Year 1 (62%) was significantly below national and in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as 2018 and 2017. Of the 30 pupils, 9 did not meet the expected standard and 2 did not sit the test. There were 21 pupil(s) that were screened in Year 2 in 2019; 12 of those met the expected standard.</p>
</div>

<p>Sentences for phonics will not appear in the pupil groups section of the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Attainment at early years foundation stage</h3>

<p>A sentence will flag when there is significant high or low attainment of the expected standard for the latest 3 years, 2 years or just the latest year, based on statistical significance and percentile rank. Sentences are generated for reading, writing and mathematics. The mathematics <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> profile outcome is a bespoke measure for the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> that is formed using the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> measures of numbers and shape, and space and measures. When the 2 measures are not the same for a child, the lowest is taken. The child has to have at least a 2 in both areas to be classified as meeting the expected standard.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Early years foundation stage attainment of the expected standard in the mathematics early learning goal (97%) was significantly above national and in the highest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018 and 2017.</p>
</div>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data so sentences based on only the latest 2 years, or the latest year are shown.</p>

<h2>Other attainment measures</h2>

<p>The following guidance is applicable to primary schools only.</p>

<p>There can be multiple sentences under each heading if your school fits the criteria of each sentence.</p>

<h3>Key stage 2: attainment of the expected standard for combined subjects</h3>

<p>A sentence is generated based on the proportion of pupils that reached the expected/higher standard in reading, writing and mathematics combined in the latest 3 years, 2 years or just the latest year.</p>

<p>The criteria that trigger this sentence require that a school is in the top or bottom 20% of all schools and either significantly above or below the national.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>In 2019, 36% of pupils achieved the key stage 2 expected standard in reading, writing and mathematics, significantly below national and in the lowest 20% of all schools. Two per cent of pupils achieved the high standard, which is significantly below the national and in the lowest 20% of all schools.</p>
</div>

<h3>English grammar, punctuation and spelling test</h3>

<p>A sentence is generated based on the proportion of pupils that achieved the expected (100+)/higher (110+) standard in the latest year. The lowest scaled score is 80 and the highest scaled score is 120. Pupils scoring at least a scaled score of 100 will have met the expected standard of the test.</p>

<p>The criteria that trigger this sentence require that a school is in the top or bottom 20% of all schools and either significantly above or below the national in the latest 3 years, 2 years or just the latest year.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>In 2019, 38% of pupils achieved a scaled score of 100+ in the English grammar, punctuation and spelling test, significantly below national and in the lowest 20% of all schools.</p>
</div>

<h3>Science</h3>

<p>The key stage 2 science sentence is generated based on the proportion of pupils that reached the expected standard in 2019.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>In 2019, 56% of pupils achieved the key stage 2 science expected standard, significantly below national and in the lowest 20% of all schools.</p>
</div>

<h3><abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr></h3>

<p>A sentence is generated based on the proportion of pupils that achieved a good level of development in the latest 3 years, 2 years or just the latest year. Children achieving a good level of development are those achieving at least the expected level in these areas of learning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>communication and language</li>
  <li>physical development</li>
  <li>personal, social and emotional development</li>
  <li>literacy</li>
  <li>mathematics</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>In 2019, the percentage achieving a good level of development in the early years foundation stage (47%) was significantly below national and in the lowest 20% of all schools.</p>
</div>

<h2>Pupil movement</h2>

<p>We have used pupil-level data from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s spring school census to identify pupils who were in Year 10 in each school in January of one year and whether they were still in the same school in January of the following year. We do not use the census data from other school terms for this analysis, for example the autumn-term census. This may mean that the figures do not match those produced by some schools or local authorities.</p>

<p>We developed a logistic multi-level model that uses contextual factors to estimate what proportion of pupils we might expect to leave each school. Our analysis shows that these contextual factors are associated with higher levels of pupil movement. The contextual factors that the model takes into account are pupils’ and schools’ characteristics.</p>

<p>The following are the pupils’ characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>eligibility for free school meals in the past 6 years</li>
  <li>speaking English as an additional language</li>
  <li>key stage 2 attainment (low, middle/high or not present in key stage 2)</li>
  <li>having special educational needs and/or disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>), especially social, emotional or mental health issues</li>
  <li>being in either the White Irish Traveller or White Roma ethnic group</li>
  <li>being looked after by a local authority</li>
  <li>income deprivation affecting children index (<abbr title="income deprivation affecting children index">IDACI</abbr>) of home postcode</li>
</ul>

<p>The model also takes into account the school characteristic of whether the school area is urban.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Between 2019 and 2020, 68 pupils left the school. Of these, 16 left between Years 10 and 11. This was significantly above the number anticipated for this school this year. The same was true in the previous year. There can be many valid reasons for high levels of pupil movement in schools. Inspectors will discuss this with school leaders, if appropriate, at the time of the next inspection.</p>
</div>

<h2>Absence</h2>

<h3>Absence for 2018/19 and earlier</h3>

<p>Absence data is based on 3 terms for 2018/19, 2017/18 and 2016/17. You can view <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/absence-statistics-guide">further information on absence statistics</a>.</p>

<p>Sentences will appear when the rate of overall absence in the latest year was in the highest or lowest 20% for similar schools. Similar here means the same phase of education and with a similar level of deprivation (in the same income deprivation affecting children index (<abbr title="income deprivation affecting children index">IDACI</abbr>) quintile).</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The rate of overall absence (4.80%) in 2018/19 was in the highest 20% of schools with a similar level of deprivation.</p>
</div>

<p>An equivalent sentence will flag for persistent absence.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The rate of persistent absence (1.30%) in 2018/19 was in the lowest 20% of schools with a similar level of deprivation.</p>
</div>

<p>If both the overall absence and persistent absence sentence flag the sentence will be combined. A sentence is generated when the rate of overall absence was in the highest or lowest 20% in the latest 3 years, 2 years or only the latest year.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Overall absence (3.1%) was in the lowest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018.</p>
</div>

<p>An equivalent sentence will flag for persistent absence.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Persistent absence (20.7%) was in the highest 20% of all schools in 2019 as well as in 2018 and 2017.</p>
</div>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data so sentences based on only the latest 2 years, or the latest year are shown.</p>

<h3>Autumn 2020 absence</h3>

<p>Autumn 2020 absence data is based on the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> census collection and has been provided as a new section within the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>. This is different to the daily attendance collection that schools have submitted throughout the pandemic, which will not be used in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>.</p>

<p>This data relates to absences during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, users should not directly compare 2020 autumn absence to historic absence rates. There may be a number of reasons for changes in absence rates. Inspectors will not use the 2020 autumn absence data by itself to draw conclusions but may use it to prompt questions regarding how well-attended a school was during this period. Inspectors may also use previous years’ data to provide context to the latest data, particularly where a school has previously had high or low absence rates in relation to other schools.</p>

<p>It is important to note that if a pupil tested positive for COVID-19 then this absence should have been treated as an illness and included within the data. However other COVID-19 related absences, such as pupils being sent home to isolate, did not count as absences within the data.</p>

<p>The sentences provided are the same as those in the usual absence section, apart from an additional sentence regarding the number of sessions missed by pupils not attending in circumstances related to COVID-19.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>There were 10 sessions missed by pupils not attending in circumstances related to coronavirus (COVID-19) – these did not count as absence within the data.</p>
</div>

<h2>Suspensions and permanent exclusions</h2>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs only have suspensions and permanent exclusions data for the latest academic year available.</p>

<p>The whole school measure includes all year groups in the school.</p>

<h3>Whole school</h3>

<p>For suspensions, ‘total’ relates to the number of pupils who had 1 or more suspensions during the academic year. ‘Repeat’ relates to the number of pupils who had 2 or more suspensions.</p>

<p>The rate of total or repeat suspensions is calculated by dividing the number of pupils suspended by the number on roll. We have profiled the national comparator for all suspensions by phase of education. Special schools are compared with the national rate for secondary schools.</p>

<p>The number of pupils with a permanent exclusion is provided for up to the last 3 years. The national average, profiled by phase of education, is included for the latest year. Special schools are compared with the national average for special schools.</p>

<p>The numbers and proportions of pupils with suspensions or permanent exclusions are often very small. These should be interpreted with caution, particularly when making comparisons over time. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic started during the 2019/20 reporting period. We are aware that rates of suspensions and permanent exclusions generally dropped during this year as a result. The suspensions and permanent exclusions data is one year behind. For example, 2019/20 data was published in July 2021. Suspensions and permanent exclusions data is for cohorts before the one shown on the context page and the number on roll may have changed.</p>

<p>Further information on pupil exclusion statistics is in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/pupil-exclusion-statistics-methodology" rel="external">the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s pupil exclusion statistics methodology publication</a>.</p>

<h3>Suspensions</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> measure for repeat suspensions is based on the number of pupils with at least two suspensions divided by the number on roll (headcount).</p>

<p>Sentences will appear when the rate of total suspensions in 2019/20 was in the highest 20% for similar schools. Similar here means the same phase of education and with a similar level of deprivation (in the same <abbr title="income deprivation affecting children index">IDACI</abbr> quintile). The <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> does not produce these sentences for primary schools due to very low suspension rates.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The rate of total suspensions (5.76%) was in the highest 20% of schools with a similar level of deprivation in 2019/20.</p>
</div>

<p>An equivalent sentence will flag for repeat suspensions, or the sentence will be combined for both.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>In 2019/20, the rates of total (5.76%) and repeat (2.23%) suspensions were in the highest 20% of schools with a similar level of deprivation.</p>
</div>

<p>A sentence shows when there are high proportions of total/repeat suspensions for up to 3 years. A high proportion relates to the highest quintile based on the national distribution of suspension proportions. This is profiled by phase and year, and only includes schools with cohorts greater than 10 in that year. Special schools are compared with the distribution for secondary schools. The sentence includes the school’s proportion of total/repeat suspensions for the latest year in brackets. If a sentence is not triggered for the latest 3 years, it will also show if the school is in the highest quintile for the latest 2 years. If a sentence is not triggered for the latest 3 or 2 years, it would show a sentence if the school is in the highest quintile in the latest year.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentences</strong></p>

<p>The rate of total suspensions (6.75%) was in the highest 20% in 2019/20 as well as in 2018/19.</p>

<p>The rate of repeat suspensions (4.38%) was in the highest 20% in 2019/20.</p>
</div>

<p>For schools with at least one pupil with a suspension in 2019/20, a sentence details the prevalence of repeat suspensions. For schools with between 1 and 10 pupils receiving a suspension, the sentence states how many received more than one. If any pupils received more than one, the sentence also states how many received 10 or more. The same applies to schools with more than 10 pupils receiving a suspension. However, the sentence quotes proportions rather than numbers of pupils.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentences</strong></p>

<p>Of the 7 pupils with at least one suspension in 2019/20, 4 were suspended on more than one occasion and 1 received 10 or more suspensions during the year.</p>

<p>Of the 56 pupils with at least one suspension in 2019/20, 34% were suspended on more than one occasion and 10.7% received 10 or more suspensions during the year.</p>
</div>

<p>For schools with at least 1 pupil with a suspension in 2019/20, a sentence states the most common reason and its frequency. It also includes the total number of suspensions and any other reasons accounting for 10% or more of the total, with their frequency.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Of the 13 suspensions in 2019/20, the following reasons each accounted for more than 10%: verbal abuse/threatening behaviour against a pupil (5), racist abuse (3), physical assault against an adult (2).</p>
</div>

<h3>Permanent exclusions</h3>

<p>A sentence appears for each school stating the number of permanent exclusions in each of the last 3 years, if data is available. The sentence includes the national average for the latest year, profiled by phase.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>There was 1 permanent exclusion in 2019/20. The national average for this year was close to zero. There were none in 2018/19 but there were 2 in 2017/18.</p>
</div>

<p>For schools with at least 1 pupil who received a permanent exclusion, a sentence states the most common reason and its frequency. It also includes the total number of permanent exclusions and any other reasons for permanent exclusions, with their frequency.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Of the 2 permanent exclusions in 2019/20, both were for theft.</p>
</div>

<h3>Key stage 5 suspensions &amp; permanent exclusions</h3>

<p>Key stage 5 in this section relates to year groups 12, 13 and 14 where applicable.</p>

<p>National averages for both suspensions and permanent exclusions are profiled by phase, special schools are compared to the secondary national.</p>

<p>The Department for Education supply the source data for this section.</p>

<h3>Suspensions</h3>

<p>Due to the low number of suspensions and permanent exclusions nationally in sixth forms it has not been possible to make the same comparisons as with the whole school measure (highest/lowest 20%). Instead, we have presented suspensions in the same way as exclusions and display the school number and national number. For this same reason the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> does not show repeat suspensions for sixth forms or comparisons to schools with similar levels of deprivation.</p>

<p>A sentence will appear stating the number of suspensions at key stage 5 in 2019/20, if there were any. The sentence will also state the national average number for the latest year. If there were also suspensions in 2018/19 and 2017/18 this information will also be presented.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>There were 2 students in key stage 5 suspended at least once in 2019/20. The national average for this year was 1. There were also 2 in 2018/19 but none in 2017/18.</p>
</div>

<p>Subsequent sentences will appear that state the reason for the suspension(s) in 2019/20.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Of the 2 total suspensions at key stage 5 in 2019/20, the following reasons each accounted for more than 10%: physical assault against a pupil (1), physical assault against an adult (1).</p>
</div>

<h3>Permanent exclusions</h3>

<p>A sentence appears for each school stating the number of permanent exclusions in each of the last 3 years, if data is available. The sentence includes the national average for the latest year.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>There was 1 permanent exclusion in 2019/20. The national average for this year was 1. There were also 3 in 2018/19 and 2 in 2017/18.</p>
</div>

<p>For schools with at least 1 pupil who received a permanent exclusion, a sentence states the most common reason and its frequency. It also includes the total number of permanent exclusions and any other reasons for permanent exclusions, with their frequency.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>Of the 2 total suspensions at key stage 5 in 2019/20, both were for unspecified reasons.</p>
</div>

<h2>Key stage 5 qualification types and retention</h2>

<p>The qualification type table is based on revised data, whereas retention is final data.</p>

<h3>Qualification types</h3>

<p>This table lists the number of students undertaking each type of qualification.</p>

<p>Students may be working towards more than 1 type of qualification and so may be counted more than once. Students taking courses that are not full qualifications are not included. Students taking academic qualifications other than A levels are not included in the table under individual qualification types but are included in the cohort information. Therefore, the numbers in each column may not add up to the total number of students and percentages may not add up to 100.</p>

<p>Below the table is a sentence which is presented when there is something significant or exceptional to highlight for the proportion of students not taking any level 3 or level 2 <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> approved qualification in 2019. This highlights when a school is in the highest or lowest 20% nationally for the latest year or the latest two years.</p>

<h3>Retention on main study programmes</h3>

<p>This section provides data on the extent to which a provider retains students to the end of the main learning aim of their study programme. The measure used in this section is retained and assessed.
Students are counted in the retained and assessed measure if they are retained to the end of their course and are assessed. The assessment may not necessarily be in the same subject or type of qualification they were aiming for when their studies began. However, the assessment must be at the same level and at least the same size as the main aim. For example, a student with an original main aim of tech level at size 1 would be considered as retained and assessed with an applied general exam result of at least size 1.
Data is presented for 4 study programmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A levels (including AS level)</li>
  <li>level 3 applied general</li>
  <li>level 3 tech level</li>
  <li>level 2 technical certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>From 2019, only technical certificates will be recognised as level 2 vocational qualifications in the 16 to 18 performance tables. In 2018, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> reported a broader range of qualifications. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s guidance on technical and vocational qualifications contains the lists of qualifications that count in 2019 performance tables.</p>

<p>A student’s study programme is defined based on their main aim. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s 16 to 18 accountability measures technical guide provides further information on how this is defined.</p>

<h2>Destinations</h2>

<h3>Key stage 4</h3>

<p>This table displays the proportion of pupils that continued to complete specified destinations. This data is publicly available and comes from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-destinations">destinations collection</a>.</p>

<p>The data for the latest year relates to the pupils that sustained destinations in 2019/20. These are pupils that reached the end of key stage 4 in 2018/19. The row header displays the year of completed education, as the latest year. The 2017/18 destinations are based on provisional data that year and therefore may not reflect some changes in the revised dataset.</p>

<p>Sustained destinations include school sixth forms, further education and sixth-form colleges, as well as higher education institutions, apprenticeships and employment. For a destination to count, pupils must sustain participation for a 6-month period.</p>

<p>Blue boxes will indicate if a figure was, statistically, significantly above the national average. Orange boxes will indicate when a figure was, statistically, significantly below the national average. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/852238/IDSR_Supporting_data_tables.ods" rel="external">supporting data tables provide the national figures here</a>.</p>

<p>If data has been suppressed due to small cohorts, ‘small cohort’ will be shown in the table. Cohort suppression in this table follows the rules used by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs will only have the destinations for the latest year due to data availability.</p>

<h3>Key stage 5</h3>

<p>This table displays the proportion of students who completed their study programme at the provider who went on to sustained education or employment, who went on to a destination not sustained or whose activity was not captured. It further shows what proportion of all students went on to an apprenticeship, to any education and to higher education.</p>

<p>The 2017/18 destinations are based on provisional data that year and therefore may not reflect some changes in the revised dataset.</p>

<p>Blue boxes will indicate if a figure was, statistically, significantly above the national average. Orange boxes will indicate when a figure was, statistically, significantly below the national average. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/852238/IDSR_Supporting_data_tables.ods" rel="external">supporting data tables provide the national figures here</a>.</p>

<p>If data has been suppressed due to small cohorts, ‘small cohort’ will be shown in the table. Cohort suppression in this table follows the rules used by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<p>For the destinations, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> use a flexible end year to determine which students are included in the measure. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-accountability-headline-measures-technical-guide">16 to 18 accountability measures technical guide</a> contains further information on the methodology.</p>

<p>This data is taken from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> source ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/destinations-key-stage-4-and-5-pupils-2019">Destinations of KS4 and 16 to 18 (KS5) students: 2019</a>’, which includes full definitions of the measures used and further breakdowns of the data.</p>

<h2>Pupil groups</h2>

<p>Sentences related to the performance of pupil groups will only appear for the pupil groups disadvantaged and low/middle/high prior attainers. Absence sentences are generated for <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr>, <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and EAL. They will be displayed where the group differs to that of the whole school. Exclusions, phonics and <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> pupil groups will not appear in this section.</p>

<p>Pupil group differences can be meaningless when analysed at school level, particularly when groups relate to small cohorts. The conversation should be about meeting the needs of all pupils.</p>

<p>If performance does not differ from that of the school, no sentences will appear, unless the pupil group had trend information that the overall school did not. For example, a sentence will appear if the group was in the highest 20% and significantly above national for 3 years but the whole school was in the highest 20% and significantly above national for the latest year only.</p>

<h3>Key stage 4</h3>

<p>Prior attainment groups are based on overall key stage 2 prior attainment, which is calculated using reading and mathematics. It was not possible to produce percentile ranks for groups in terms of the attainment for the 4plus threshold measure; this is due to the spread of data; therefore, only Attainment 8 sentences will appear in the groups section.</p>

<h3>Key stage 5</h3>

<p>Sentences for the prior attainment and the disadvantaged groups will appear for value added relating to A level, AS level and applied general qualifications. They will also appear for completion and attainment data relating to tech level qualifications and technical certificate qualifications</p>

<p>Prior attainment groups are based on students’ average points score at key stage 4, which is calculated by giving a points score to each grade and taking an average across all the students’s grades. For further detail on the methodology to determine these prior attainment groups for level 2 and level 3 please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#ks5-student-groups">key stage 5 student group section</a>.</p>

<h3>Key stage 2</h3>

<p>Prior attainment groups are based on overall key stage 1 prior attainment, which is calculated using reading and mathematics. It was not possible to produce percentile ranks for groups in terms of attainment at key stage 2; this is due to the spread of data and, therefore, only statistical significance tests have been performed to identify high or low performance.</p>

<h3>Key stage 1</h3>

<p>Prior attainment groups are based on emerging, expected and exceeding in reading, writing or mathematics early learning goals. It was not possible to produce percentile ranks for groups in terms of attainment at key stage 1; this is due to the spread of data and, therefore, only statistical significance tests have been performed to identify high or low performance.</p>

<h3>Absence</h3>

<p>Absence sentences are generated for <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr>, <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and EAL.</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>due to small cohorts of low and high prior attainment groups, it is much less likely for sentences to appear</li>
  <li>it was not possible to flag group sentences for <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> and phonics attainment; this is due to the spread of the data</li>
  <li>pupil group sentences for exclusions will not be shown</li>
</ul>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data so sentences based on only the latest 2 years, or the latest year are shown. For the exclusion sentence, service children’s education provider IDSRs only have data for the latest academic year available.</p>

<h2>School and local context</h2>

<p>Due to the impact of COVID-19, the 2021 <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> will not contain 2020 performance data. However, contextual information was collected in the January 2021 census after the COVID-19 outbreak. As such, we have included 2021 context pages for schools and inspectors to view this data. We have also retained the 2019 context data for year groups, as this provides context for pupils who took exams or tests in summer 2019.</p>

<p>Some schools may have blank 2021 context pages and populated 2019 context pages. This is likely to be because the school became an academy between 2019 and 2021, for example. In this case, the 2021 context data will be assigned to the new school and therefore not sit alongside the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> that contains the 2019 performance and context data held under the predecessor details.</p>

<h3>School characteristics</h3>

<p>The chart shows school-level information, based on the January school census, for 2019, 2020 and 2021. If a school has a sixth form, a separate row will appear that shows the context for years 12,13 and 14 where applicable.</p>

<p>The chart contains the following measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the percentage of pupils in receipt of free school meals (<abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr>) at the time of the January census; these pupils are those who are/have been eligible for <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr> and have claimed them some time in the last 6 years (Reception to Year 11). <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr> data is not collected for sixth forms.</li>
  <li>the percentage of pupils whose first language is not English or believed to be other than English</li>
  <li>the percentage of pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> who do not have an education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr>) plan (<abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> support)</li>
  <li>the percentage of pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and who have a statement of <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> or <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan</li>
  <li>the number of pupils on roll</li>
</ul>

<p>Stability is a measure of the percentage of students who were admitted to the school at the standard time of admission. The stability percentage is calculated by dividing the number of pupils who meet the stability criteria by the number of all eligible pupils (pupils in Years 1 to 11 with a single or main dual registration at the school at the time of the January school census). The stability measure is not available for school sixth forms.</p>

<p>A pupil is counted as stable if he or she either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>joined the school in or before September in Year 1</li>
  <li>joined the school in or before the month by which at least 5% of the year group had also joined the school</li>
  <li>joined the school in a month/national curriculum year combination in which at least 40% of the year group joined the school (the 40% must equate to at least 10 pupils in primary schools or 20 pupils in secondary schools)</li>
  <li>joined the school in a month/national curriculum year combination in which at least 10% of the year group joined the school (the 10% must equate to at least 10 pupils in primary schools or 20 pupils in secondary schools) <strong>and</strong> the same month/national curriculum year combination met these criteria in at least one other year group within the school</li>
</ul>

<p>For each group, school figures along with the national will show for each year. The quintile boxes compare the latest year to the national distribution for all schools. Special schools are compared with secondary school nationals.</p>

<h3>Trust/LA level information</h3>

<p>This section provides information about the trust or local authority that the school is part of. For example, if a school is part of a trust, it will have information about the number of schools in the trust and the latest overall effectiveness grades of the schools within the trusts. Similarly, it will show local authority information for local authority maintained schools.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the latest inspection grades may include grades of the school before joining the trust. Between November 2017 and January 2018, we <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/changes-to-ofsteds-statistical-reporting-of-inspection-outcomes-for-maintained-schools-and-academies">consulted on changes to our official statistics and management information</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of this consultation, we changed the way we show and report on the latest inspection of all providers. We now include the grades from the predecessor schools for schools that have not yet been inspected in their current form. This provides a more comprehensive view of the sector. For more details of the changes, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/changes-to-ofsteds-statistical-reporting-of-inspection-outcomes-for-state-funded-schools-an-analysis-of-the-changes">official statistics documents</a>. If a school has not been inspected in its current form, the latest overall effectiveness grade therefore relates to the predecessor school. This is made clear in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>.</p>

<h3>School workforce</h3>

<p>This section provides information about the school workforce at November 2020, based on published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/school-workforce-in-england-november-2020"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> school workforce data</a>.</p>

<p>It provides information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of full-time vacant teacher posts in the school at the time of the November 2020 school workforce census</li>
</ul>

<p>This section also provides information on staff turnover as at the 2019 school workforce census. Staff turnover rates are calculated using the number of FTE turnover leavers and the total FTE staff at the school. A school will be highlighted as having high staff turnover if the turnover rate was in the highest 20% of schools for the previous 2 years. Low staff turnover is not highlighted. Special schools are compared to primaries.</p>

<p>Due to COVID-19 no teacher absence data was available in 2020.</p>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs will not display information in this section as they are currently not contained in the dataset.</p>

<h3>Local area and school links</h3>

<p>The local area section provides information about the level of deprivation in the local area in which the school resides, together with an aggregated pupil-derived deprivation indicator. Each deprivation indicator is based on the <abbr title="income deprivation affecting children index">IDACI</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="income deprivation affecting children index">IDACI</abbr> measures the proportion of all children aged 0 to 15 living in income-deprived families. It is a subset of the income deprivation domain, which measures the proportion of the population in an area experiencing deprivation relating to low income. The definition of low income used includes both those people who are out of work and those who are in work but who have low earnings and who satisfy the respective means tests.</p>

<p>Please note that we have updated the <abbr title="income deprivation affecting children index">IDACI</abbr> (from English Indices of Deprivation) measure from 2015 to 2019. As such, some <abbr title="income deprivation affecting children index">IDACI</abbr> values may have changed as a result when compared to historic IDSRs.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>The school location deprivation indicator was in quintile 2 (less deprived) of all schools. The pupil base is in quintile 4 (more deprived) of all schools in terms of deprivation.</p>
</div>

<p>The sentences display what quintile the deprivation level falls under. Each quintile represents a bound of 20%. The higher the quintile the greater the level of deprivation.</p>

<p>A school’s local area is based on the 2011 lower layer super output area (<abbr title="lower layer super output area">LSOA</abbr>) in which it resides. LSOAs are a geographic hierarchy designed to improve the reporting of small area statistics in England and Wales. The minimum population in each <abbr title="lower layer super output area">LSOA</abbr> is 1,000 and the maximum is 3,000. Regarding households, there is a minimum of 400 households in each <abbr title="lower layer super output area">LSOA</abbr> and a maximum of 1,200.</p>

<p>You can read further information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019">data used for the local area deprivation</a>.</p>

<p>This section also provides information about other schools and alternative provision providers that pupils in this school were dual registered at according to the January 2021 census. The number of pupils at the school is shown in brackets.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example sentence</strong></p>

<p>According to the January 2021 census, pupils at this school were also registered at the following providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Primary - School A - URN XXXXXX (1)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs will not display information on location-based deprivation in this section as they are currently not contained in the dataset.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> contains the latest financial information – for 2019/20 for both local authority maintained schools and academies – including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the revenue reserve of the school (local authority maintained schools) or trust (academies)</li>
  <li>the in-year balance and how this compares with the previous year</li>
  <li>the spend per pupil and how this compares with the previous year (trend for local authority maintained schools only)</li>
  <li>the level of grant funding compared with the national average for the school phase and type (local authority maintained school or academy)</li>
</ul>

<p>For academies within MATs, central trust income and expenditure is also considered. Income and expenditure attributed to the central trust is apportioned to individual academies on a per pupil basis to provide a combined academy and trust figure for each academy.</p>

<p>The source for the school finance information is the data underpinning the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://schools-financial-benchmarking.service.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s school financial benchmarking tool</a>. You can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://schools-financial-benchmarking.service.gov.uk/Help/DataSources" rel="external">view or download the data sources</a>.</p>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs will not display information in this section as they are currently not contained in the dataset.</p>

<h3>Ethnicity whole school and key stage 5</h3>

<p>Ethnicity information comes from the January 2021 school census. The sentence states how many ethnic groups are present in the school out of 17.</p>

<p>The 17 possible ethnic groups are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>White British</li>
  <li>White Irish</li>
  <li>White Traveller of Irish Heritage</li>
  <li>White Gypsy/Roma</li>
  <li>White Any other White background</li>
  <li>Mixed White and Black Caribbean</li>
  <li>Mixed White and Black African</li>
  <li>Mixed White and Asian</li>
  <li>Mixed Any other Mixed background</li>
  <li>Asian or Asian British Indian</li>
  <li>Asian or Asian British Pakistani</li>
  <li>Asian or Asian British Bangladeshi</li>
  <li>Asian or Asian British Any other Asian background</li>
  <li>Black or Black British Caribbean</li>
  <li>Black or Black British African</li>
  <li>Black or Black British Any other Black background</li>
  <li>Chinese</li>
</ul>

<p>This excludes the groups ‘Any other ethnic group’, ‘Parent/pupil preferred not to say’ and ‘Ethnicity not known’.</p>

<p>The sentence states those with 5% or more of the school. For this section ‘Any other ethnic group’, ‘Parent/pupil preferred not to say’ and ‘Ethnicity not known’ are included, so may appear in the top 5 largest groups.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>This school has 3 out of 17 possible ethnic groups. Those with 5% or more are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>71%: White - British</li>
  <li>14%: Ethnicity not known</li>
  <li>7%: Asian or Asian British - Indian</li>
  <li>7%: Mixed - White and Black Caribbean</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Year group context</h2>

<p>Due to the impact of COVID-19, the 2022 <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> will not contain 2020 performance data. However, the January 2021 census collected contextual information after the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, we have included 2021 context pages for schools and inspectors to view this data. We have also retained the 2019 context data for year groups, as this provides context for pupils who took exams or tests in summer 2019.</p>

<p>Some schools may have blank 2021 context pages and populated 2019 context pages. This is likely to be, for example, because the school became an academy between 2019 and 2020. In this case, the 2021 context data will be assigned to the new school. The data will therefore not sit alongside the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> that contains the 2019 performance and context data held under the predecessor details.</p>

<h3>Characteristics</h3>

<p>The chart shows school-level year group characteristics, based on the 2021 January school census for the following measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number on roll</li>
  <li>the percentage of pupils in receipt of <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr> at the time of the January census; these pupils are those who are or have been eligible for <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr> and have claimed them some time in the last 6 years (Reception to Year 11)</li>
  <li>the percentage of pupils who speak English as an additional language</li>
</ul>

<p>Shading on the chart indicates when the year group was different to other year groups in the school.</p>

<p>For key stage 5 (where applicable), there are different rules that <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> uses to allocate students to the different measures. The year group characteristics is based on the census data so there may be students that are no longer on roll but still allocated to the provider for accountability purposes.</p>

<h3>Prior attainment</h3>

<p>The prior attainment table presents how pupils in school performed at the previous key stage in relation to their year group.</p>

<p>We have based prior attainment in 2021 on the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for Years 1 and 2 we have not been able to calculate prior attainment due to the data file not being available</li>
  <li>for Year 3 there is no prior attainment data due to COVID-19</li>
  <li>for Years 4, 5 and 6 we have based this on the percentage who achieved at least the expected standard at key stage 1</li>
  <li>for Year 7 there is no prior attainment data due to COVID-19</li>
  <li>for Years 8, 9, 10 and 11 we have based this on those achieving the expected standard at key stage 2</li>
</ul>

<p>We have based prior attainment in 2019 on the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in reading and in writing for Years 1 and 2 on the percentage of pupils who achieved at least the expected level in the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> profile early learning goal</li>
  <li>in mathematics for Years 1 and 2 on the percentage who achieved at least the expected level in both of the mathematics early learning goals</li>
  <li>for Years 3, 4 and 5 on the percentage who achieved at least the expected standard at key stage 1</li>
  <li>for Year 6 on the points equivalent to whole levels</li>
  <li>for Years 7, 8 and 9 on those achieving the expected standard at key stage 2</li>
  <li>for Years 10 and 11 on the average point score at key stage 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Shading indicates whether the pupils in this school were above or below national. This is triggered if the school value is 1 or 2 standard deviations from the national. If pupils were in line with national, a dash is shown. If the number of pupils was 10 or below, an ‘X’ is shown.</p>

<h3>Prior attainment at key stage 5</h3>
<p>This table shows the spread of average prior attainment of students at the end of key stage 4. For students studying A levels, this is based on GCSEs only. For students studying applied general and tech levels, all approved qualifications are included. The <a class="govuk-link" href="#ks5-student-groups">key stage 5 student group section</a> describes the calculation, which refers to average prior attainment and does not indicate the highest grade or the number of qualifications a student attained.
Note that the prior attainment groups used here are different to those used in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#ks5-student-groups">key stage 5 student group section</a> section. Here the following groups are used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students with prior attainment grades U–2</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grade 3</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grade 4</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grades 5–6</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grades 7–9</li>
</ul>

<p>Blue boxes will indicate if a figure was statistically significantly above the national figures. Orange boxes will indicate if a figure was statistically significantly below the national figures.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> characteristics</h3>

<p>There is a formal assessment to decide if a pupil needs a statement of <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> or an <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan.</p>

<p><abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> support is the help a school gives pupils that falls outside the usual curriculum. Outside specialists can tell or support the class teacher and <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> coordinator.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan is for children and young people aged up to 25 who need more support. This extra help is not available through <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support. <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plans identify educational, health and social needs and set out the support to meet those needs.</p>

<p>The January 2021 census provides data for this table. The table displays the number of pupils in the school who have a <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> need and what the need category is. The 2 halves of the table represent pupils who have <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> support and pupils who have an <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan.</p>

<p>It also shows what year the pupil is in. It flags if the school has a <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> unit and how many pupils out of all those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> are also disadvantaged.</p>

<p><abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> units are special provisions within a mainstream school. These units contain separate classes to teach pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>. These units:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive extra funding from the local authority</li>
  <li>cater for a specific type or types of <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> (for example, autistic spectrum disorders)</li>
  <li>are usually for pupils with statements or <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plans (but this is not required)</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantaged pupils are those who were eligible for <abbr title="free school meals">FSM</abbr> at any time during the last 6 years and children looked after (in the care of the local authority for a day or more or who have been adopted from care).</p>

<p>Resourced provision refers to the places reserved at a mainstream school for specific pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>. The pupils learn within mainstream classes but require some specialist facilities.</p>

<p>Resourced provision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receives extra funding from the local authority</li>
  <li>caters for a specific type or types of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>, for example specific learning difficulties</li>
  <li>is usually for pupils with statements or <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plans, but this is not required</li>
</ul>

<p>The resourced provision information comes from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <abbr title="Get information about schools">GIAS</abbr> service.</p>

<h2>Progress and attainment trend</h2>

<h3>Progress 8: three-year trend</h3>

<p>The Progress 8 3-year trend section shows how the school has performed compared with other schools nationally overall and for each of the Progress 8 elements for each of the last 3 years, regardless of the methodology at the time. There is a clear indication of the position in terms of the quintile, when each quintile represents 20% of schools. Red boxes will indicate when a figure was, statistically, significantly below the national average. Green boxes will indicate when a figure was, statistically, significantly above the national average. Quintiles will display an ‘X’ when they are based on cohorts of 10 or fewer pupils. Also, no statistical significance will show for cohorts of 10 or fewer pupils.</p>

<p>The arrows indicate an increase or decrease in progress score. These align with the progress trend analysis. We have only made comparisons between 2017–18, and 2018–19. This is referred to as markedly higher or lower in the legend of the progress and attainment trend chart. Note that this is not based on statistical significance testing. The number in brackets shows the eligible cohort. The calculation that underpins these is shown in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#understanding-IDSR">‘Understanding the data in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>’</a> section.</p>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data, so only the latest 2 years will have content.</p>

<h3>Value added three-year trend</h3>

<p>The EBacc pillar value added 3-year trend section shows how the school has performed compared with other schools nationally for science, languages and humanities value added for each of the last 3 years, regardless of the methodology at the time. There is a clear indication of the position in terms of the quintile, when each quintile represents 20% of schools. Red boxes indicate when a figure was, statistically below the national average. Green boxes indicate when a figure was, statistically above the national average. Quintiles will display an ‘X’ when they are based on cohorts of 10 or fewer pupils.
Level 3 value-added data is shown for A level, AS level and applied general qualifications. Red boxes indicate if the score was statistically significantly below the national average. Green boxes indicate if a score was statistically significantly above the national average.
The ‘A level’ group includes the following A level qualifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A level</li>
  <li>applied A level single award</li>
  <li>applied A level double award
The ‘AS level’ group includes the following AS level qualifications:</li>
  <li>AS level (not continued to full A level)</li>
  <li>applied AS level single award</li>
  <li>applied AS level double award</li>
</ul>

<p>For reference, the ‘A level group’ <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> report combines these 2 groups together.
Service children’s education providers do not have data for value added measures.</p>

<h3>Attainment 8: three-year trend</h3>

<p>The Attainment 8 3-year trend section shows how the school has performed compared with other schools nationally for overall Attainment 8 and each of the Attainment 8 elements: English, mathematics, EBacc and open. The school is compared with other schools nationally for each of the last 3 years, regardless of the methodology at the time. There is a clear indication of the position in terms of the quintile, when each quintile represents 20% of schools. Quintiles will display an ‘X’ when they are based on cohorts of 10 or fewer pupils.</p>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data, so only the latest 2 years will have content.</p>

<h3>Attainment thresholds three-year trend</h3>
<p>The EBacc pillar grade 4+ 3-year trend section shows how the school has performed compared with other schools nationally for the percentage of pupils achieving grade 4+ in science, languages and humanities. The school is compared with other schools nationally for each of the last 3 years, regardless of the methodology at the time. There is a clear indication of the position in terms of the quintile, when each quintile represents 20% of schools. Quintiles will display an ‘X’ when they are based on cohorts of 10 or fewer pupils.
The A level AAB% 2-year trend section shows how the school performed compared with other schools nationally for the % shows the percentage of students who have achieved 3 A levels at grades AAB or better, of which at least 2 are in facilitating subjects. The facilitating subjects are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>biology</li>
  <li>chemistry</li>
  <li>physics</li>
  <li>mathematics</li>
  <li>further mathematics</li>
  <li>geography</li>
  <li>history</li>
  <li>English literature</li>
  <li>classical/modern languages</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key stage 5 attainment two-year trend</h3>
<p>The APS 2-year trend section shows how the school performed compared with other schools nationally based on average point score the following: A level, best 3 A levels, applied general, tech level (level 3) and technical certificates (level 2).</p>

<p>Average progress score (APS) per entry is calculated by dividing the total number of points achieved by students by the total size of entries for those students. This is then aggregated to give an overall APS score for a provider. Entries are based on the size of the qualification and students may contribute multiple qualifications to the measure. Students may also be counted in more than 1 qualification type.</p>

<p>Service children’s education provider IDSRs do not incorporate 2017 data, so only the latest 2 years will have content.</p>

<h3>Reading, writing and mathematics three-year trend</h3>

<p>The following guidance is relevant for schools with a primary phase.</p>

<p>This section shows how the school has performed compared with other schools nationally overall and for each element for each of the last 3 years, regardless of the methodology at the time. There is a clear indication of the position in terms of the quintile, when each quintile represents 20% of schools. Red boxes will indicate when a figure was, statistically, significantly below the national average. Green boxes will indicate when a figure was, statistically, significantly above the national average. As in the rest of the report, figures are displayed in grey when they are based on 10 or fewer pupils. Also, no statistical significance will show for cohorts of 10 or fewer pupils.</p>

<p>The arrows indicate an increase or decrease in progress score. These align with the progress trend analysis. We have only made comparisons between 2017/18, and 2018/19. This is referred to as markedly higher or lower in the legend of the progress and attainment trend chart. Note that this is not based on statistical significance testing. The calculation that underpins these is shown in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#understanding-IDSR">‘Understanding the data in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>’</a> section. The number in brackets shows the number of entries.</p>

<h3>Other attainment measures</h3>

<p>The following guidance is relevant for schools with a primary phase.</p>

<p>This section shows how the school has performed compared with other schools nationally overall and for each element for each of the last 3 years. There is a clear indication of the position in terms of the quintile, when each quintile represents 20% of schools. Red boxes will indicate when a figure was, statistically, significantly below the national average. Green boxes will indicate when a figure was, statistically, significantly above the national average. As in the rest of the report, figures are displayed in grey when they are based on 10 or fewer pupils. Also, no statistical significance will show for cohorts of 10 or fewer pupils.</p>

<h2>Subject entries</h2>

<h3>Subject entries at key stage 4</h3>

<p>This section shows the subjects entered for by this school in 2021, 2019 and 2018. Subject entries data for 2020 is not available. There may be some differences between 2021 entries and earlier years. For example, in 2021 early entries are not included but are included for earlier years.</p>

<p>The purple shading is darker where more pupils were entered. Subjects are grouped by subject cluster and listed alphabetically first by cluster then by subject.</p>

<p>Qualification type is also included, which covers the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AS</li>
  <li>EBacc AS</li>
  <li>EBacc GCSE</li>
  <li>EBacc L1/L2 cert</li>

<h2>Understanding the data in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Statistical significance</h3>

<p>Assessment data and information are starting points for inspectors’ discussion with schools. Statistical significance testing is used in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> to draw attention to noteworthy values. These values show when differences in school’s performance may be due to more than chance variation. The <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> uses percentile ranking as well as statistical significance testing. This allows us to look at relative performance across time while also highlighting noteworthy changes.</p>

<h3>Significance calculation for threshold measures</h3>

<p>A normal approximation to the binomial distribution is used to identify statistically significant differences between proportions of pupils (shown in the areas of interest).
Before applying the test, we check that:</p>

<p>nP</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>n(1-P)</p>

<p>are greater than or equal to 5.</p>

<p>When:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P represents the national average of pupils reaching the expected standard</li>
  <li>n represents the total number of pupils</li>
</ul>

<p>The calculation is as follows:</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Significance calculation for threshold measures" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/92353/Capture__2_.png"></div></figure>

<p>Otherwise not statistically significant.</p>

<p>When:</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Significance calculation for threshold measures" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/92354/Capture.png"></div></figure>

<p>This methodology is applied to the following performance measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>key stage 2 expected standard and high standard/greater depth thresholds</li>
  <li>key stage 1 expected standard and greater depth thresholds</li>
  <li>Year 1 phonics</li>
  <li>destinations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Progress trend analysis calculation</h3>

<p>Progress is a within year, norm referenced measure. Scores are not directly comparable year on year. To allow for direct comparisons across years, every progress score is standardised using the following formula:</p>

<p>(Progress score – mean) / standard deviation</p>

<h3>Absence and exclusions</h3>

<p>Absence data is usually in all IDSRs by December each year. This is because data is only provided to Ofsted after the primary <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> release.</p>

<p>The permanent and fixed-period exclusions data is one year behind. For example, 2017/18 exclusions data was published in July 2019. Exclusions data is for cohorts before the one shown on the context page and the number on roll may have changed.</p>

<p>For absence and fixed-period exclusions, special schools are compared to the national for secondary schools. For permanent exclusions, special schools are compared to the national average for special schools.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<p>All data in the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> is from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>. We use the data to calculate school-, local-authority- and national-level data. Pupil-level data is anonymous and does not contain names or addresses. It is not shared with inspectors at any point.</p>

<p>We receive the following data sets from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to produce the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>.</p>

<p>National pupil database:</p>

<ul>
  <li>key stage 1 and phonics</li>
  <li>school census to populate contextual sections</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> profile</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Analyse School Performance">ASP</abbr> all key stages</li>
</ul>

<p>Performance tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school and college database (<abbr title="school and college database">SCDB</abbr>) primary and secondary</li>
  <li>key stage 2</li>
  <li>key stage 4</li>
  <li>key stage 5</li>
  <li>level 3 value added</li>
</ul>

<p>Absence and exclusions data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school-level exclusions</li>
  <li>2-term absence</li>
  <li>3-term absence</li>
  <li>1-term absence (autumn 2020)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information on the accountability measures in these <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/primary-school-accountability">primary school accountability</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/progress-8-school-performance-measure">secondary accountability measures</a> (including Progress 8 and Attainment 8)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special schools and pupils with special educational needs and disabilities</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> is produced for special schools. However, it may contain very little information about the performance of pupils.</p>

<p>Pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> are a diverse group with differing needs and expectations. Therefore, the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> will no longer display any averages for this group.</p>

<p>Contextual information is provided for the group, including the breakdown of the number of pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> by primary special educational need.</p>

<h3>Junior and middle schools</h3>

<p>A standard sentence appears to explain that junior and middle schools have lower progress scores on average. Also, due to the age range of pupils at middle schools, pupils will have only attended a middle school for a short time before they take their key stage 2 tests.</p>

<p>Inspectors should be aware of this and, as with any inspection, carefully consider a range of information and data.</p>

<h3>Missing data</h3>

<p>There are a few possible reasons why data for some years is not shown for a particular measure.</p>

<p>In charts and tables, data may not be shown for some years because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the measure did not exist, was defined differently or was not available to Ofsted for that year; if this is the case, the data is shown as a dash</li>
  <li>the school had no pupils for a particular measure in that year; if this is the case, the cohort will be shown as a 0 and a dash will be shown for the measure</li>
  <li>if the school recently changed legal status, for example from a local authority maintained school to a sponsor-led academy, the data may be shown under the predecessor school name or unique reference number (URN) in <abbr title="Analyse School Performance">ASP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>National figures</h3>

<p>The national figures may differ from the figures published in the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> performance tables and <abbr title="Analyse School Performance">ASP</abbr>. This is due to the varying decimal precisions used between organisations.</p>

<p>The disadvantaged pupil group is compared to the national for pupils who are not disadvantaged.</p>

<p>Prior attainment pupil groups are compared to their respective pupil group nationally.</p>

<p>Service children’s education providers have been assigned a phase based on the ages of pupils in the school.</p>

<h3>Cohorts and numbers of pupils included</h3>

<p>Cohorts display the total number of pupils based on the group and year of the measure presented.</p>

<p>For measures when all pupils were entered, the cohort shows the number of pupils the measure is based on. For some measures, it is used as the denominator for percentages.</p>

<p>If there have been any leavers and joiners, then the cohort number shown on progress and attainment data may not match the context section. The context section is a snapshot of the day the school census is taken in January of that year.</p>

<p>The ‘number of pupils included’ on progress pages only includes pupils with prior attainment information.</p>

<h3>Key stage 5 cohorts</h3>

<p>There are different rules that <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> uses to allocate students to the different measures. The year group characteristics is based on the census data so there may be students that are no longer on roll but still allocated to the provider for accountability purposes. The qualification type table is based on revised data, whereas retention is from final.</p>

<p>For the destinations, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> use a flexible end year to determine which students are included in the measure. There are more details in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-accountability-headline-measures-technical-guide">accountability guide</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Key stage 5 student groups</h2>

<p>Prior attainment student groups are shown for some measures. These groups are based on students’ average points score at key stage 4, which is calculated by giving a point score to each grade and taking an average across all the student’s grades. The following table shows the corresponding points scores for each grade.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">GCSE grade (old grading structure)</th>
      <th scope="col">Points score</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A*</td>
      <td>8.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>5.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>E</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>1.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>G</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>U</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that in 2017, 2018 and 2019, points were allocated to new GCSEs (with grades of 9 to 1). The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/progress-8-school-performance-measure">secondary accountability measures guidance</a> contains further details on how these scores are calculated.
In the <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr>, we use groups of scores. For level 3 students, these are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students with prior attainment grades 7–9 (equivalent to grades A*–A under the old grading structure)</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grades 4–6 (equivalent to grades B–C under the old grading structure)</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grades 3 and under (equivalent to grades D–G under the old grading structure)</li>
</ul>

<p>To align students’ average points scores to these groups, we calculate an upper bound and lower bound for each group.</p>

<p>To calculate the upper bound for each group, we calculate the midpoint between the maximum points score within the group and the minimum points score within the next highest group.</p>

<p>For example, to calculate the upper bound for the 4–6 group, we take the midpoint between the maximum points score for the 4–6 group (5.5) and the minimum points score for the 7–9 group (7):
Upper bound = (5.5 + 7) / 2 = 6.25</p>

<p>Similarly, to calculate the lower bound for each group, we calculate the midpoint between the minimum points score for the group and the maximum points score for the next lowest group.</p>

<p>For example, to calculate the lower bound for the 4–6 group, we take the midpoint between the minimum points score for the 4–6 group (4) and the maximum points score for the 3 and under group (3):</p>

<p>Upper bound = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5
These calculations produce the following average points score boundaries.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">GCSE grade group</th>
      <th scope="col">Average points score boundaries</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>7–9</td>
      <td>6.25 and above</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4–6</td>
      <td>3.5–6.25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3 and under</td>
      <td>0–3.5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For level 2 students, we follow an equivalent process to calculate average points score boundaries for the following groups.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">GCSE grade group</th>
      <th scope="col">Average points score boundaries</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3-9</td>
      <td>2.5 and above</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>1.25–2.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1 and under</td>
      <td>0–1.25</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For value-added data relating to A level, AS level and applied general qualifications, and completion and attainment data relating to tech level qualifications, the following groups based on prior attainment for level 3 students are shown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students with prior attainment grades 7–9 (average points score of 6.25 or higher)</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grades 4–6 (average points score of 3.5 or above up to, but not including, 6.25)</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment of 3 and under GCSE point score (average points score below 3.5)
For completion and attainment data relating to technical certificate qualifications, disadvantaged students and the following groups based on prior attainment for level 2 students are shown:</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grades 3–9 (average points score of 2.5 or higher)</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grade 2 (average points score of 1.25 or above up to, but not including, 2.5)</li>
  <li>students with prior attainment grade 1 and under (average points score below 1.25)
If performance does not differ from that of the provider, no sentences will appear.</li>
