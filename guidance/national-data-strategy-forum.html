<h2>About the National Data Strategy Forum</h2>

<p>The National Data Strategy sets out the actions this government will take on data. It is not the final answer, but a framework for a conversation about the way that we support the responsible and trusted use of data in the UK. This collaborative approach has been a key principle throughout the development of the strategy.</p>

<p>The National Data Strategy Forum is a structured programme of engagement designed to ensure that a diverse range of perspectives beyond government and the public sector continue to inform the strategy’s implementation.</p>

<p>It supports us in implementing our plans in such a way that builds public trust and ensures the data opportunity works for everyone, everywhere.</p>

<p>Co-chaired by DCMS and techUK, the Forum brings together a variety of stakeholders from industry, academia and civil society to :</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop collaborative programmes of work to support the delivery of the National Data Strategy</li>
  <li>champion the National Data Strategy through their networks, to embed its principles and goals beyond government</li>
  <li>help shape the development of the future vision for the National Data Strategy</li>
</ul>

<p>We want to foster an open and inclusive Forum which welcomes in new ideas, and so does not comprise a set membership, but invites in experts and participants as relevant to specific discussions at each Forum event.</p>

<p>The Forum has no decision-making role and is not part of any formal governance mechanism for the National Data Strategy. Its role is to challenge and champion the strategy, and join together in ensuring the way we use data in the UK is the best it can be.</p>

<h2>The story so far</h2>

<p>The National Data Strategy Forum was announced as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation/outcome/government-response-to-the-consultation-on-the-national-data-strategy">government response to the consultation on the National Data Strategy</a>, in direct response to feedback received from stakeholders through the consultation.</p>

<p>Following the Forum’s first discussion in the summer 2021, we identified in collaboration with Forum participants five key work streams to structure that activity.</p>

<p>In February 2022 we updated on progress at a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/national-data-strategy-forum-workplan-2022-update.html" rel="external">National Data Strategy Forum webinar</a> and set out our priorities for the next six months, as detailed below:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>Unlocking the power of data for everyone, everywhere</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Last summer we launched a challenge to Forum participants to help us increase our understanding of how to unlock the power and value of data across different sectors, geographies and sections of society.</p>

<p>Over the following months we published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-data-strategy-mission-1-policy-framework-unlocking-the-value-of-data-across-the-economy">NDS Mission 1 Policy Framework</a> for government action to set the correct conditions to make private and third sector data more usable, accessible and available across the UK’s economy while protecting people’s data rights and private enterprises’ intellectual property.</p>

<p>We are now developing the evidence base to understand which are the greatest areas of opportunity, where greater use and sharing of data can unlock the most benefit. We want to continue to work with experts from across the UK data ecosystem to critically evaluate our evidence base and identify areas for intervention, allowing us to target action most effectively.</p>

<p>Forum participants ran events showcasing the value of data and local best practice across the UK. Experian hosted a Midlands event for regional stakeholders and Bright Data supported a data skills webinar organised by the Collab Group of Further Education colleagues. The Data Economy Innovation team, DCMS also hosted a webinar on the recently launched NDS Mission 1 Policy Framework.</p>

<p>We created our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-data-strategy-forum">National Data Strategy Forum webpage</a> to provide a hub for sharing guest blog posts, event materials, examples of the power of data in action and case studies of where organisations have used data to make a difference across our economy and society.</p>

<h4>Our next 6 month challenge</h4>

<p>We will continue to identify and share case studies and examples of best practice demonstrating the power and value of data to organisations of all sizes, across the country, and work with Forum participants to showcase, communicate and amplify these across various channels.</p>

<p>Over the coming months we want to continue to work with experts to help critically evaluate our Mission 1 Policy Framework and identify areas for intervention.</p>

<p>Over the coming months, we want to hear from pioneering thinkers on data sharing architecture, about what good data sharing systems will look like. We are looking to build our evidence base to better understand the different types of data sharing architecture, what outcomes they will allow us to realise, and the role the government might need to play in supporting their development.</p>

<h4>Key deliverables</h4>

<p>Over the next six months we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Convene discussions to raise awareness of the opportunities presented by greater data sharing within and between sectors, and gather expert advice and evidence to inform our implementation approach for the Mission 1 Policy Framework; including a regional ‘future scenarios’ workshop, hosted in partnership with PwC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue to work with Forum participants to showcase the power and value of data through public events, blog posts, newsletters, social media and other communication channels</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to get involved</h4>

<p><strong>Trust in data</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Last year we set out our ambition to rebalance the conversation about data use and build public trust in responsible data use.</p>

<p>Data has the potential to unlock enormous societal and economic benefits. However, as we outline in the NDS, the value of data can only be harnessed if there is public support for its use.</p>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cdei-publishes-its-first-report-on-public-sector-data-sharing/addressing-trust-in-public-sector-data-use">previous research on data sharing by the public sector</a>, the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) identified an environment of ‘tenuous trust’, in which data is used and shared for beneficial purposes, but public awareness of it is generally low. Meanwhile, media coverage tends to focus on the risks associated with the use of data and data-driven technologies, such as data breaches and biases in algorithms. Some of the controversies associated with the use of these technologies remain lodged in public consciousness.</p>

<p>In November, as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-tech-forum-chairs-statement-london">Future Tech Forum</a>, we convened an international discussion on the future of trust in data as a force for good. Across the two days, we heard how we can further build public trust in partnerships that bring together innovative data infrastructure and robust data governance. The Chair’s Report from the event can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-tech-forum-chairs-statement-london/future-tech-forum-chairs-statement-london">here</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, CDEI convened our National Data Strategy Forum Trust in Data Working group. View the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1023498/Terms_of_Reference_-_Public_Trust_and_Data__NDS_Forum.pdf" rel="external">Terms of Reference</a>.</p>

<p>It aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>scope and collate research into public attitudes towards data use, with contributions from the CDEI’s Public Attitudes teams</li>
  <li>identify examples of data use that deliver societal and economic benefits across sectors</li>
  <li>inform how these insights can best shape communications to build public awareness and understanding of data-driven societal benefits</li>
</ul>

<p>It met twice last year to begin this work, and has discussed some inspiring examples of the value of data, including the work of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cdei.blog.gov.uk/2020/12/17/testing-new-approaches-to-responsible-innovation/" rel="external">Police Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/innovatie/mobiliteit/public-eye/" rel="external">Amsterdam crowd monitoring</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://policyinpractice.co.uk/case-study-reimagine-debt/" rel="external">Barking and Dagenham’s debt relief pilot</a>.</p>

<p>CDEI’s Public Attitudes Team is also working extensively with Britain Thinks to explore public attitudes towards data. Through a series of focus groups they have identified six different audience groups which share commonalities in their approach to and views of data use. This segmentation  will allow our communication to be targeted and use the most appropriate channels for who we want to reach. It will be published in the coming months.</p>

<h4>Our next 6 month challenge</h4>

<p>We want to continue our work with the National Data Strategy Forum Trust in Data Working Group to conduct and collate research into public attitudes towards data use, map out the landscape of positive case studies of responsible data use, and promote a more nuanced public debate on data use, ensuring the potential benefits of data use are understood, as well as the risks that occur when data is not used responsibly.</p>

<h4>Key deliverables</h4>

<p>Over the coming months we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Continue to convene the NDS Forum Trust in Data Working Group, in line with the above objectives.</li>
  <li>Continue mapping out the landscape of case studies demonstrating  examples of data use that deliver societal and economic benefits across sectors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to get involved</h4>

<p>Please continue to flag any relevant case studies - where responsible data use has led to tangible positive outcomes - to the secretariat at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ndsforumsecretariat@dcms.gov.uk">ndsforumsecretariat@dcms.gov.uk</a>. We would be particularly interested in case studies focusing on healthcare and SMEs.</p>

<p><strong>Data reform</strong></p>
</div>

<p>In September of last year, the government published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/data-a-new-direction">Data: a new Direction</a>: a consultation on reforms to create a new, ambitious, pro-growth and innovation-friendly data protection regime that underpins the trustworthy use of data.</p>

<p>The consultation covered a wide range of different policy challenges, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>removing barriers to innovation with proposals to offer clear rules and streamlined legislation;</li>
  <li>reducing burdens on businesses and delivering better outcomes for people with proposals for a more flexible and risk-based accountability framework;</li>
  <li>proposals to allow the transfer of data freely and safely overseas; proposals to make it simpler for public and private organisations to use and share data in the public interest; and</li>
  <li>proposals to empower the ICO to encourage the responsible use of data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the wide range of issues, the Forum was essential in helping us promote debate around the consultation to a huge range of stakeholders right across the UK.</p>

<p>We received nearly 3000 consultation responses. Thank you to everyone who responded, and particular thanks to the 26 Forum participants from across the UK who hosted roundtable discussions and engagement events. In total they convened 40 events with over 200 organisations participating. It was brilliant to see such a wide range of organisations get involved, from global think tanks and non-profit organisations to research institutes and trade bodies.</p>

<p>The Minister for Media, Data and Digital Infrastructure, Julia Lopez MP, was keen to hear directly from stakeholders as part of this process so we also held a final roundtable discussion for organisations to present back on the major insights from events.</p>

<h4>Our next 6 month challenge</h4>

<p>We are now considering the response to the consultation and will legislate for the new regime when parliamentary time allows. We plan to publish the Government’s response to consultation in Spring 2022, which will include details on our next steps as we continue to drive forward progress with Mission 2 of the National Data Strategy.</p>

<p>This document will set out further details on how we progress with development and implementation of reforms. We will continue to update stakeholders across the UK, including through the Forum on the progress of these reforms.</p>

<p>We will continue to seek views on the shape of the reforms we want to make, as well as expertise on emerging policy areas where we are gathering evidence.</p>

<h3>Key deliverables</h3>

<p>Further details will be set out in due course.</p>

<p><strong>Net zero</strong></p>
</div>

<p>This workstream set out to explore how we can work together to harness the power of data to meet our net zero ambitions. In September 2021, we committed to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Hosting a Forum discussion with data centre providers on how the sector can help meet the government’s net zero ambitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting a Forum discussion that aimed to spotlight existing initiatives as well as upskill the ecosystem in the ways data can be used to support our net zero ambitions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On 21 October 2021, alongside techUK, the Minister of State for Media, Data and Digital Infrastructure, Julia Lopez MP, co-hosted the first event of this workstream. It invited the data centre community to share the sector’s progress towards Net Zero and the challenges they face going forward. The sector explained the steps they’re taking to reduce emissions, and updated us on their progress made to date through initiatives such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.climateneutraldatacentre.net/" rel="external">Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact</a>.</p>

<p>We shared the actions government is taking to reduce its own ICT carbon footprint through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greening-government-ict-and-digital-services-strategy-2020-2025/greening-government-ict-and-digital-services-strategy-2020-2025">Greening Government: ICT &amp; Digital Services Strategy 2020-2025</a>, which seeks to develop the transparency and accountability needed to reduce carbon emissions and costs associated with government procurement. We are also embedding <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-technology-sustainable">sustainability as a key decision point </a> and principle for the design and approval of government-owned digital systems and services, as well as in our central procurement frameworks such as the cloud. Further detail on the outcomes from our first event can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dcmsblog.uk/2021/12/data-net-zero/" rel="external">blog post on using data to reach Net Zero</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, on 21 January 2022, with the help of the Royal Society, the NDS Forum met to discuss how we can better unlock the power of data and data-driven technologies to drive Net Zero. The purpose of this session was to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Learn</strong> about the exciting work happening that is using data in innovative ways in pursuit of Net Zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify</strong> the gaps or barriers currently preventing different sectors from making the most of data, and steps they are taking to overcome these, if applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connect</strong> with like minded individuals who are interested in better understanding how they can utilise data to support Net Zero.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The event was chaired by Dame Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge and started with a panel discussion on the potential for data to enable the net zero transition. The panel included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neil Lawrence, DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge</li>
  <li>Sarah Hayes, CReDo Project Lead, National Digital Twin Programme</li>
  <li>Laura Sandys, Chair of the UK Government’s Energy Digitalisation Taskforce</li>
  <li>Gavin Starks, Founder of Icebreaker One</li>
</ul>

<p>Following this, participants discussed in smaller groups what steps we would need to take to better use data in support of Net Zero. Throughout the discussion, we heard how innovative uses of data were supporting our net zero aspirations. However, we also heard the remaining barriers, including cultural and skills challenges, that prevent us going further faster. We will shortly publish a blog post outlining our key lessons from the session.</p>

<h4>Our next 6 month challenge</h4>

<p>Over the past 6 months, this workstream has made significant progress and highlighted the important role that data has to play in combating climate change. This was evidenced during the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://together-for-our-planet.ukcop26.org/tech-for-our-planet/" rel="external">Tech For Our Planet challenge</a>, which as part of COP26, showcased how innovative data-driven solutions can make a vital contribution to our efforts to combat climate change across all sectors.</p>

<h4>Key deliverables</h4>

<p>Following our event with the Royal Society, we are keen to use the convening power of the Forum to continue spotlighting examples of where data is making the vital difference and joining up the dots between initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>Measuring the data ecosystem</strong></p>
</div>

<p>In September 2021, we published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-data-strategy-monitoring-and-evaluation-update">National Data Strategy monitoring and evaluation framework</a>, which set out our desire to embody a dynamic &amp; forward looking approach to implementation, informed by the work that this Forum is taking forward.</p>

<p>A key part of that successful implementation is being able to measure the data ecosystem and build our understanding of how it operates.</p>

<p>Last year, we completed the first step in achieving this by launching our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-data-strategy-monitoring-and-evaluation-update/national-data-strategy-monitoring-and-evaluation-framework#tracking-indicator-suite-call-for-evidence">National Data Strategy indicator suite</a>, a product designed to give us a clear grasp of the real-world context for our action through tracking key parts of the data ecosystem.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who responded to the call for evidence on metrics to add to the suite, and those who contributed via our workshop hosted in partnership with Policy Connect.</p>

<p>We are in the process of analysing those responses and preparing to develop this work further in 2022. Our vision is to paint a picture of what data use looks like across the country, and its contribution to the opportunities across the UK that it can help unlock.</p>

<p>Together, we want to make something that can add real value to the way we all approach data in the UK now, and can inform policy-setting over the long term.</p>

<h4>Our next 6 month challenge</h4>

<p>Our focus over the coming months will be to take forward a project to map stakeholder activity across the Data Ecosystem. We know that there is so much brilliant work happening across the UK to help unlock the value of data for everyone, everywhere. We want to test the feasibility of creating an openly available resource to show how the work of different organisations fits together in helping realise the ambitions set out in the NDS. This project will build on valuable work already conducted (such as the Open Data Institute’s work to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YgpiEpE7C6UrJCjLoTtg-UY5lxGVPEuUUvHR9WfFu1E/edit#heading=h.sz6xhlocas0l" rel="external">map data activity across HMG</a> and Open Innovations’ work to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://open-innovations.org/projects/uk-data-landscape/" rel="external">map the data landscape</a>.</p>

<h4>Key deliverables</h4>

<p>Our first step is to run a pilot focussing on stakeholder activity supporting the implementation of Mission One of the National Data Strategy. Running a pilot will allow us to test the value of the concept while generating insights that can shape the evidence base for future government action in support of Mission One.</p>

<h4>How to get involved</h4>

<p>We want to learn about businesses, academic institutions, civil society organisations and any other private organisations, whose work supports one or more of the  7 priority areas within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-data-strategy-mission-1-policy-framework-unlocking-the-value-of-data-across-the-economy">Mission 1 policy framework</a>. These are:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Promote the development of good data foundations so that data is held according to the FAIR principles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage the development and uptake of Privacy Enhancing Technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support the development of a thriving intermediary ecosystem that enables responsible data sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support the development of infrastructure that promotes the availability of data for research and development purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use incentives to maximise value for money data sharing in support of public good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support effective and well-functioning markets by addressing data practises that distort competition and consumer outcomes — including by widening access to data, where appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn from international partners and support UK’s data economy and innovation agenda on the world stage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to contribute by helping us build our understanding of how the data ecosystem is supporting these 7 priority areas please register your interest with the secretariat at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ndsforumsecretariat@dcms.gov.uk">ndsforumsecretariat@dcms.gov.uk</a></p>
