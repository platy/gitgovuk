<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Department for Education allocates funding each year to help maintain and improve the condition of school buildings and grounds.</p>

<p>In any given financial year, eligible schools can access funding through either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school condition allocations (<abbr title="school condition allocations">SCA</abbr>), with funds paid to eligible bodies responsible for maintaining school buildings</li>
  <li>the condition improvement fund (<abbr title="condition improvement fund">CIF</abbr>), a bidding round with funds paid directly to single academy trusts, small multi-academy trusts (<abbr title="multi-academy trusts">MATs</abbr>), small voluntary aided (<abbr title="voluntary aided">VA</abbr>) bodies and sixth-form colleges</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, devolved formula capital (<abbr title="developed formula capital">DFC</abbr>) is allocated for individual schools and other eligible institutions to spend on capital projects that meet their own priorities.</p>

<h2>Who the funding is for</h2>

<p>School condition funding includes capital allocations for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authorities and local-authority-maintained schools, including maintained nursery schools</li>
  <li>local voluntary-aided bodies and voluntary-aided schools</li>
  <li>academies and large multi-academy trusts (<abbr title="multi-academy trusts">MATs</abbr>) and sponsors</li>
  <li>sixth-form colleges</li>
  <li>special schools not maintained by the local authority</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions with eligible students</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eligibility for <abbr title="school condition allocations">SCA</abbr> for the 2022 to 2023 financial year</h2>

<p>Schools and those responsible for school buildings are eligible for either <abbr title="school condition allocations">SCA</abbr> or <abbr title="condition improvement fund">CIF</abbr> depending on their size and type.</p>

<p>Local authorities, larger <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">MATs</abbr> and larger <abbr title="voluntary aided">VA</abbr> school bodies receive direct <abbr title="school condition allocations">SCA</abbr> to invest in priorities across the schools for which they are responsible. Smaller academy trusts, smaller <abbr title="voluntary aided">VA</abbr> bodies and sixth-form colleges are instead able to bid into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/condition-improvement-fund">Condition Improvement Fund (<abbr title="condition improvement fund">CIF</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="condition improvement fund">CIF</abbr> eligible schools have been invited to bid into the fund for 2022 to 2023. If a school has been invited to bid for <abbr title="condition improvement fund">CIF</abbr> in the 2022 to 2023 financial year, their responsible body will not receive any <abbr title="school condition allocations">SCA</abbr> funding on their behalf. Schools invited to <abbr title="condition improvement fund">CIF</abbr> should therefore apply for funding if they have condition investment requirements.</p>

<p>To receive direct <abbr title="school condition allocations">SCA</abbr>, multi-academy trusts and <abbr title="voluntary aided">VA</abbr> bodies must meet both eligibility criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the trust or <abbr title="voluntary aided">VA</abbr> body must have had 5 or more open schools at the start of September 2021</li>
  <li>those open schools (or their predecessor schools) must have had at least 3,000 pupils counted in the spring 2021 census or the 2020 to 2021 individualised learner record (ILR)</li>
</ul>

<p>For special and alternative-provision schools (including pupil referral units), we now multiply the pupil count by 4.5 for the purposes of <abbr title="school condition allocations">SCA</abbr> eligibility for the 2022 to 2023 financial year. For example, we would now count a MAT with 1,000 pupils in special schools as having 4,500 pupils. This reflects the fact that these schools tend to have lower pupil numbers for their size and more complex facilities.</p>

<p>For eligibility, we count all pupils that are sole, dual-main, or dual-subsidiary enrolled. If pupils are registered at more than one institution, we divide the count by the number of institutions that the pupil is registered at. For example, pupils dual registered at a mainstream school and a pupil referral unit (PRU) would have their count divided by 2 at both institutions.</p>

<p>For nursery schools and sixth forms, we use the number of full-time equivalent (<abbr title="full-time equivalent">FTE</abbr>) pupils rather than headcount.</p>

<p>In autumn 2021, we notified academy trusts and <abbr title="voluntary aided">VA</abbr> school bodies that are eligible for <abbr title="school condition allocations">SCA</abbr> in the financial year 2022 to 2023. Eligibility should not be assumed unless it has been confirmed.</p>

<p>All of these institution types are eligible for devolved formula capital.</p>

<h2>Funding allocations for the 2022 to 2023 financial year</h2>

<p>Capital funding is based on financial years. For the latest funding amounts see:</p>

</ul>

<h2>How the funding is calculated</h2>

<p>See <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063628/Condition_funding_methodology_2022_to_2023.pdf">condition funding methodology for 2022 to 2023</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">347 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">15 pages</span>)</span> for information on eligibility and how the funding is calculated.</p>

<h2>What you can spend it on</h2>

<p>See <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063629/Condition_grants_spend_guidance_2022_to_2023.pdf">condition grants spend guidance</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">219 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">14 pages</span>)</span> for guidance on the purpose of the funding, what you can spend it on and over what time period.</p>

<h2>Previous years’ funding</h2>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/*/https:/www.gov.uk/government/publications/capital-allocations" rel="external">National Archives website</a> for <abbr title="school condition allocations">SCA</abbr> and <abbr title="developed formula capital">DFC</abbr> allocations for previous years.</p>

<p>The healthy pupils capital fund was a one-year fund for the 2018 to 2019 financial year only.</p>

<p>In the 2018 budget, the government announced an extra £400 million of capital funding for schools in England for the 2018 to 2019 financial year. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20190304090343/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capital-allocations/capital-funding-for-2018-to-2019" rel="external">additional capital funding page on the National Archives</a> for more information.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Prime Minister announced an additional £560 million for repairs and upgrades to school buildings, on top of funding already allocated for the 2020 to 2021 financial year.</p>

<h2>Good estate management</h2>

<p>We expect academy trusts and other bodies responsible for schools to manage their school estate strategically and maintain their estate in a safe working condition. This has also been set out in the Academy Trust Handbook 2021. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools">Good estate management for schools (GEMS)</a> includes guidance on developing an estates strategy and asset management plan, and a self-assessment tool to identify estate management priorities. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/asbestos-management-in-schools">Managing asbestos guidance for schools</a> sets out further advice on asbestos.</p>

<p>Responsible bodies must ensure they secure value for money through appropriate procurement routes. For large projects, the school buildings <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-buildings-construction-framework/construction-framework-handbook">construction framework</a> is available for use and should be considered as part of project development planning.</p>

<h2>The Trust Network</h2>

<p>The Trust Network is a group of academy trusts who are committed to good estate management, and support schools to build their capability and practise. They share best practice, exchange knowledge and, where needed, form a single voice to discuss issues or concerns with the Department for Education and other national agencies and help improve the resources available to support schools. You can join the network for free and find out more about their events through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thetrustnetwork.org.uk/" rel="external">The Trust Network website</a>.</p>

<p>The Trust Network is led by volunteers from a diverse range of <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">MATs</abbr> from across England and membership is open to all independently run, state-funded schools. More than 400 <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">MATs</abbr> and single-academy trusts are currently registered as members.</p>

<h2>Grants to local authorities</h2>

<p>The <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1062803/Condition_funding_grant_determination.pdf">condition funding grant determination</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">98.7 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">3 pages</span>)</span> sets out the conditions of grant for payments to local 
authorities in the 2022 to 2023 financial year. The Secretary of State for Education makes grant determinations under section 31 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/26" rel="external">Local Government Act 2003</a>.</p>
