<p>Due to a minor technical issue, the link to the booking portal in this guidance will not be available until later today. Please return to this page later if you wish to make a booking.</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance is for people arriving in England who have visited or passed through <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19" class="govuk-link">a country where travel to the UK is banned (sometimes called the ‘red list’)</a> in the 10 days before their arrival.</p>

<p>You should follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">separate guidance if you’re travelling from a country that is not on the list where travel to the UK is banned</a>.</p>

<p>You cannot travel to the UK if you’ve visited or passed through a country where travel to the UK is banned in the last 10 days, unless you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a British national</li>
  <li>an Irish national</li>
  <li>anyone with residence rights in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>From 15 February onwards, everyone allowed to enter England who has visited or passed through a country where travel to the UK is banned in the last 10 days must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>quarantine for 10 days in a managed quarantine hotel</li>
  <li>take a coronavirus (COVID-19) test on or before day 2 and on or after day 8 of quarantining</li>
  <li>follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home">national lockdown rules</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Providing false or deliberately misleading information when filling out your passenger locator form is an offence punishable by imprisonment. You could be fined up to £10,000, imprisoned for up to 10 years, or both, if you do not provide accurate details about the countries you have visited in the 10 days before you arrived in the UK.</p>

<p>If you break the quarantine rules you may face a penalty of up to £10,000.</p>

<p>You should follow separate advice if you arrive in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-health-checks-at-borders/pages/self-isolation/" rel="external">Scotland</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Hotel quarantine: what it is</h2>

<p>Everyone who arrives into England must quarantine for 10 days from the point of their arrival. The day of arrival in England will be treated as day zero.</p>

<p>To stop the spread of potentially harmful variants into the UK, more stringent measures are in place for people who have travelled from or passed through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19">a country on the list where travel to the UK is banned (the ‘red list’)</a> in the last 10 days before arrival.</p>

<p>From 15 February, you must quarantine in a managed quarantine hotel if you’ve travelled from or passed through a country on the list where travel to the UK is banned.</p>

<h2>Who has to go into hotel quarantine</h2>

<p>If you are a British or Irish national, or third country national with residence rights in the UK and you have been in or passed through a red-list country in the 10 days before your arrival, you will need to quarantine in a managed quarantine hotel, unless you’re exempt.</p>

<p>Travellers from countries not on the ‘red list’ must follow the guidance set out here.</p>

<h2>What you need to do before you arrive in England</h2>

<p>Before you travel you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a coronavirus (COVID-19) test and get a negative result during the 3 days before you travel. You must take the test in the 3 days before the service on which you will arrive in England departs. For example, if you travel directly to England on Friday, you must take the test on the Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday</li>
  <li>book a managed quarantine hotel where you will quarantine. Your quarantine package will include your managed quarantine hotel, quarantine transport and your travel test package for COVID-19 tests on day 2 and day 8 of quarantine</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">complete a passenger locator form</a> with details of where you will quarantine when you arrive. You must provide a quarantine package booking reference number to complete your passenger locator form</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Due to a minor technical issue, the link to the booking portal in this guidance will not be available until later today. Please return to this page later if you wish to make a booking.</p>
</div>

<p>You will need to agree to pay for, and book, a quarantine package before you complete your passenger locator form (PLF) and board your return journey to the UK.</p>

<p>The package includes the costs of transport from the port of arrival to the designated hotel, food, accommodation, security, other essential  services and testing.</p>

<p>For those facing significant financial hardship as a result of this charge, there will be an opportunity to apply for a deferred repayment plan when booking. This is only available for individuals who already receive income-related benefits, and you will be required to pay back your debt to the government in 12 monthly installments.</p>

<p>All package prices will be reviewed before the end of March and may change. While hotels normally set a zero fee for children aged under 3, we are setting this for children under 5 years old because they will not be tested. The proposed zero fee for children under 5 years old will mean that for the present the government will bear the costs of additional food and drinks consumed by arrivals aged between 3 and 5 years old.</p>

<p>You must not apply for deferred payment if you are not eligible. If you provide false information, or omit key information that has been asked for in your application, you will be committing fraud and liable for conviction.</p>

<p>If you have not arranged a quarantine package prior to your arrival in England, you face a penalty of up to £4,000 and will still have to pay for your quarantine package on arrival.</p>

<h2>Where you can arrive</h2>

<p>If you’re required to quarantine in a quarantine hotel you can only arrive in England at certain ports of entry. Currently these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Heathrow Airport</li>
  <li>Gatwick Airport</li>
  <li>London City Airport</li>
  <li>Birmingham Airport</li>
  <li>Farnborough Airfield</li>
</ul>

<p>Other ports of entry may be added in the future.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing booking to a different port of entry on or after the 15 February it’s your responsibility to change it to one of the ports of entry specified above. After 15 February carriers will not be permitted to carry anyone who has been in a red list country in the previous 10 days to any other port of entry other than those specified.</p>

<p>If you’re required to quarantine in a managed quarantine hotel and do not arrive in England at one of the designated ports of entry, you may face a penalty of up to £10,000 and will be charged for the cost of transportation to the nearest designated port or entry.</p>

<h2>Arriving and transporting to a managed quarantine hotel</h2>

<p>When you arrive in England you will need to provide your completed passenger locator form to Border Force officers alongside your passport and negative COVID-19 test result.</p>

<p>You will be escorted through the airport with other passengers who need to quarantine at a managed quarantine hotel. Your ‘quarantine package’ includes transport to your quarantine hotel (and back to the airport at the end of your quarantine).</p>

<p>You must only travel to your managed quarantine hotel by the transport specified in your quarantine package and not by public or private transport.</p>

<p>At the end of the quarantine period you will be transported to the airport you were collected from when you arrived in England.</p>

<h2>Quarantining in a managed quarantine hotel</h2>

<p>When you arrive at the managed quarantine hotel you will be required to quarantine in your room for 10 days. The managed quarantine hotel will provide your meals.</p>

<p>It is not possible to select a particular room at the managed quarantine hotel or to seek a higher standard room upon arrival.</p>

<p>You can quarantine with the people you travelled with and hotels will prioritise allocating larger or connecting rooms to families.</p>

<p>If you’re the parent or guardian of an unaccompanied child arriving in England, you can join your child in quarantine.</p>

<p>You cannot have visitors in quarantine, including friends or family, unless they are providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>emergency assistance</li>
  <li>care or assistance, including personal care</li>
  <li>medical assistance</li>
  <li>veterinary services</li>
  <li>certain critical public services</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have items delivered to you during the quarantine period, they will be brought to the door of your room by the managed quarantine hotel staff. Staff will try to bring the items to you in a timely manner. However, given the need to maintain compliance with COVID guidelines, deliveries may not be able to be brought to your door immediately when they arrive at the hotel.</p>

<p>The hotels selected for managed quarantine are able to meet the vast majority of requirements.</p>

<p>You will be able to seek medical attention, including for repeat prescriptions and/or if you need to fill a prescription</p>

<p>You will only be allowed to leave your room in very limited circumstances including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to travel directly to leave the Common Travel Area</li>
  <li>to fulfil a legal obligation including attending court or satisfying bail conditions or to participate in legal proceedings</li>
  <li>to exercise but only with special permission from hotel staff or security. This is not guaranteed</li>
  <li>in exceptional circumstances, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>seeking medical assistance where this is required urgently or on the advice of a registered medical practitioner</li>
      <li>to avoid injury, illness or escape a risk of harm (for example situations such as fire or flooding, or cases where domestic abuse occurs within a group quarantining together)</li>
      <li>to access critical public services including social services or services provided to victims (for example critical access such as for a child to see their social worker)</li>
      <li>to access veterinary services where required urgently or on the advice of a veterinary surgeon (no animals other than guide dogs would be in a hotel quarantine)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>You will need to take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2. This first test is designed to help identify any potentially harmful variants of COVID-19 at the earliest opportunity. You will not be allowed to shorten your quarantine period if you receive a negative test result, as you may still develop COVID-19. Tests will be taken in your own accommodation.</p>

<p>If you receive a positive test result on day 2, you must quarantine until day 12. If you are in quarantine with people you have travelled with, they will also need to quarantine until day 12.</p>

<p>If you receive a positive result for your day 2 test, you will not be required to take any further tests.</p>

<p>You will also need to take a COVID-19 test on or after day 8. If you receive a positive test result on day 8 you will be required to quarantine until day 18.</p>

<p>You will not be able to end your managed quarantine early through the Test to Release scheme.</p>

<p>Children under 5 will not be required to take the day 2 or day 8 test</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">order a test here</a> if you develop at least one of these 3 coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms at any point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>you’ve lost your sense of smell or taste or it’s changed</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re in quarantine with people you have travelled with you will need to quarantine when you receive a positive test for 10 days. In a group quarantining together this could mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>person A: receives a positive test result on day 2 so must quarantine to day 12 (no day 8 test)</li>
  <li>person B: needs to quarantine until day 12 also as a close contact of person A. If they are negative on day 2 they are still required to take a day-8 test. Person B receives a positive test result on day 8 so they will need to quarantine to day 18</li>
  <li>person C: Needs to quarantine until day 12 also as a close contact of person A. If negative on day-2 test, they are still required to take a day-8 test. They receive a negative day-8 test result. Person C still needs to quarantine to day 18 as they are a contact of person B as well as of person A</li>
</ul>

<p>If someone tests positive other people in the same room should be moved into another room if there is space available in the hotel.</p>

<p>If you do not take the tests you may face a penalty of up to £2,000.</p>

<h2>Leaving managed quarantine</h2>

<p>You will be able to leave quarantine when you have received a negative result from your day 8 test and have quarantined for 10 full days.</p>

<p>If you receive a positive result from either of your tests, you will not be able to leave managed quarantine until 10 days have passed from the date of the test.</p>

<p>If, despite a negative test on day 8, you develop new coronavirus symptoms on day 9 or day 10, this would trigger a further test and extended quarantine for 10 days, if the new test is positive.</p>

<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>A very small proportion of people arriving in England who have visited or passed through a red-list country will not need to quarantine in a managed quarantine hotel or in private accommodation.</p>
