<h3>Getting to Hull</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/f3kLBgBHPi6tkX958" rel="external">Find Hull on a map</a></p>

<p>The nearest railway station is Hull, around 2 miles from the prison. From there you can take a bus or taxi.</p>

<p>To plan your journey by public transport:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" rel="external">National Rail Enquiries</a>
</li>
  <li>use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.traveline.info/" rel="external">Traveline for local bus times</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>By car, head towards the ferry port and the prison is just before it. There is a free car park (number 4) for visitors on Southcoates Lane with 6 spaces for Blue Badge holders in front of the main gate.</p>

<h3>Entering Hull</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Hull has a strict family friendly dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes. This means no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons. No multiple layers of clothing, no high boots or steel toe capped boots, no sportswear, no offensive slogans and no ripped or see-through clothing.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Hull. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>
<p>In the visitor centre, there is a vending machine for hot drinks, baby changing facilities and disabled access. There is also a children’s play area.
In the visiting hall, there is a canteen serving hot and cold drinks, sandwiches, snacks and sweets.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days taking place.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Hull</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Hull.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>
<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms but these do not accept incoming calls. They are able to make calls every day between 7:30am and 11pm. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Hull using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Hull.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Hull</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Hull can apply for permission for visitors to hand in items during a visit.</p>

<p>All property will be opened and checked by officers. Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
