<h2>Payments and deductions</h2>

<h3>Number of payments</h3>

<p>The Department for Education makes the payment in one lump sum.</p>

<p>You can only claim one additional payment in each academic year, even if you are eligible for more than one type of additional payment.</p>

<p>For example, if you are eligible for both the levelling up premium and early-career payments you can only claim one of these additional payments in the same academic year.</p>

<p>However, if you are eligible to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/additional-payments-for-teaching-eligibility-and-payment-details/teachers-claim-back-your-student-loan-repayments-eligibility-and-payment-details">claim back your student loan repayments</a>, you will be able to claim this as well as a levelling up premium payment or early-career payment.</p>

<h3>Taxable income and National Insurance</h3>

<p>The Department for Education will pay Income Tax up to basic rate (currently income of £12,571 to £50,270, taxed at a rate of 20%) and National Insurance for the payment on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you become or already are a higher rate taxpayer, any additional Income Tax and National Insurance contributions for this payment over the higher rate will remain your responsibility. The higher rate is currently income of £50,271 to £150,000, taxed at a rate of 40%.</p>

<p>The Department for Education is not liable to reimburse tax at the higher rate.</p>

<p>Review the tax bands on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates">Income Tax rates and personal allowances</a>.</p>

<p>The payment is not part of your salary from your employer. You, your employer, or the government will not contribute to your pension as part of this payment.</p>

<p>You should consider any other benefits or tax credits that could be affected if you claim this payment.</p>

<h3>Student loan deductions</h3>

<p>If you have a student loan then a deduction will go towards repaying your student loan. This is taken off your payment automatically.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about the early-career payments, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:earlycareerteacherpayments@digital.education.gov.uk">earlycareerteacherpayments@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
