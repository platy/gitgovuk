<h2>Translated guidance</h2>

<p>If English is not your first language you may find our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-get-help-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak-translations">translated guidance or easy read version</a> useful. Women’s Aid also have <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/covid-19-coronavirus-safety-and-support-resources/">guidance documents on domestic abuse and coronavirus available in a number of languages</a> for victims, family and friends, and community members of those affected.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19) and domestic abuse</h2>

<p>The government acknowledges that coronavirus household isolation instructions can cause anxiety for those who are experiencing or feel at risk of domestic abuse. There is never an excuse for domestic abuse, no matter what the circumstances are.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Household isolation instructions as a result of coronavirus do not apply if you need to leave your home to escape domestic abuse.</p>
</div>

<p>If you feel at risk of abuse, there is help and support available to you, including the police, online support, helplines and refuges. You can find more information about these and other services on this page.</p>

<h2>Codeword scheme</h2>

<p>If you are experiencing domestic abuse and need immediate help, ask for ‘ANI’ in a participating pharmacy. ‘ANI’ stands for Action Needed Immediately but also phonetically sounds like the name Annie. If a pharmacy has the ‘Ask for ANI’ logo on display, it means they’re ready to help. They will offer you a private space, provide a phone and ask if you need support from the police or other domestic abuse support services.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Ask for ANI logo used in participating pharmacies. The campaign is accompanied with the hashtag #YouAreNotAlone. " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/112372/Ask-for-ANI-codeword-pharmacy-poster_resized.png"></div>
<figcaption><p>Ask for ANI logo used in participating pharmacies</p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>Recognise domestic abuse</h2>

<p>Anyone can be a victim of domestic abuse, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexuality or background.</p>

<h3>What is domestic abuse?</h3>

<p>Domestic abuse is not always physical violence. It can also include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>coercive control and ‘gaslighting’</li>
  <li>economic abuse</li>
  <li>online abuse</li>
  <li>threats and intimidation</li>
  <li>emotional abuse</li>
  <li>sexual abuse</li>
</ul>

<h3>What signs to look for</h3>

<p>If you believe that you or someone else could be a victim of domestic abuse, there are signs that you can look out for including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>being withdrawn, or being isolated from family and friends</li>
  <li>having bruises, burns or bite marks</li>
  <li>having finances controlled, or not being given enough to buy food or pay bills</li>
  <li>not being allowed to leave the house, or stopped from going to college or work</li>
  <li>having your internet or social media use monitored, or someone else reading your texts, emails or letters</li>
  <li>being repeatedly belittled, put down or told you are worthless</li>
  <li>being pressured into sex</li>
  <li>being told that abuse is your fault, or that you’re overreacting</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-recognise-the-signs/domestic-abuse-recognise-the-signs#how-to-recognise-domestic-abuse-in-a-relationship" class="govuk-link">more signs to look for</a>.</p>

<h3>Support a friend if they’re being abused</h3>

<p>Let them know you’ve noticed something is wrong.</p>

<p>If someone confides in you, there is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-recognise-the-signs/domestic-abuse-recognise-the-signs#support-a-friend-if-theyre-being-abused" class="govuk-link">more information on how to support a friend who is being abused</a>.</p>

<p>If you are worried that someone you know is a victim of domestic abuse, you can call Refuge’s National Domestic Abuse Helpline for free, confidential support, 24 hours a day on 0808 2000 247. Visit the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk" class="govuk-link">helpline website</a> to access information on how to support a friend.</p>

<p>If you believe there is an immediate risk of harm to someone, or it is an emergency, always call 999.</p>

<h2>Report it</h2>

<p>If you, or someone you know, is a victim of domestic abuse find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-domestic-abuse" class="govuk-link">report domestic abuse</a>.</p>

<p>If you are in immediate danger, call 999 and ask for the police.</p>

<p>If you are in danger and unable to talk on the phone, call 999 and listen to the questions from the operator and, if you can, respond by coughing or tapping on the handset.</p>

<h3>Call 999 from a mobile</h3>

<p>If prompted, press 55 to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.policeconduct.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/research-learning/Silent_solution_guide.pdf" rel="external">Make Yourself Heard</a> and this will transfer your call to the police.</p>

<p>Pressing 55 only works on mobiles and does not allow police to track your location.</p>

<h3>Call 999 from a landline</h3>

<p>If the operator can only hear background noise and cannot decide whether an emergency service is needed, you will be connected to a police call handler.</p>

<p>If you replace the handset, the landline may remain connected for 45 seconds in case you pick up again.</p>

<p>When 999 calls are made from landlines, information about your location should be automatically available to the call handlers to help provide a response.</p>

<h3>If you are deaf or can’t verbally communicate</h3>

<p>You can register with the <a href="https://www.emergencysms.net/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">emergencySMS</a> service. Text REGISTER to 999. You will get a text which tells you what to do next. Do this when it is safe so you can text when you are in danger.</p>

<h2>Get help if you, or someone you know, is a victim</h2>

<p>We publish a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-domestic-abuse">list of the main organisations you can speak to for support</a>. Women’s Aid also has a list of <a rel="external" href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/useful-links/" class="govuk-link">useful links for websites and organisations providing relevant information and support</a>.</p>

<h3>Get help for children and young people</h3>

<p>Witnessing and experiencing domestic abuse can have a serious impact on a child’s long-term health. It is a top priority that vulnerable children and young people remain safe during this uncertain period. If you are concerned that a child is at risk of harm, you should refer this information to children’s social care, or to the police if you believe the child is in immediate danger.</p>

<p>If you are a young person, and adults around you are affected by domestic abuse, this can also affect you. If you are a young person who is experiencing domestic abuse in your own relationship, this is called teen relationship abuse. There is support available for you on both <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/advice-hub/domestic-abuse">domestic abuse</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/advice-hub/teenage-relationship-abuse" class="govuk-link">teen relationship abuse</a>.</p>

<h2>Support for employers and professionals</h2>

<p>If you are an employer, let your employees know that if they are facing domestic abuse you want to help them to get help. Stay in regular contact with employees you know, or fear, may be facing abuse and if you lose contact with them, take swift action to visit them. If you believe there is an immediate risk of harm to someone, or it is an emergency, always call 999.</p>

<p>Encourage employees to look out for others who may be facing domestic abuse and signpost them to support. Your staff may also be worried about their own abusive behaviour at this time. There is no excuse for domestic abuse, no matter what stresses you are under and support is available.</p>

<h2>Get legal help</h2>

<h3>Apply for a disclosure of information</h3>

<p>Under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-violence-disclosure-scheme-pilot-guidance" class="govuk-link">Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme</a> (also known as ‘Clare’s Law’), you can ask the police to check whether a new, former or existing partner has a violent past. This is called ‘right to ask’. If records show that you may be at risk of domestic abuse from a partner, the police will consider disclosing the information. A disclosure can be made if it is legal, proportionate and necessary to do so.</p>

<p>The ‘right to ask’ also allows a third party, such as a friend or family member, to apply for a disclosure on behalf of someone they know. Again, the police can release information if it is lawful, necessary and proportionate to do so.</p>

<p>To make an application under the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, contact the police. You can do this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visiting a police station (the household isolation instruction as a result of coronavirus does not apply if you need to leave your home to escape domestic abuse)</li>
  <li>phoning 101</li>
  <li>speaking to a member of the police on the street</li>
</ul>

<p>If you believe there is an immediate risk of harm to someone, or it is an emergency, you should always call 999.</p>

<h3>Get a court order to protect you or your child</h3>

<p>If you’re a victim of domestic abuse you can apply for a court order or injunction to protect yourself or your child from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your current or previous partner</li>
  <li>a family member</li>
  <li>someone you currently or previously lived with</li>
</ul>

<p>This is called a non-molestation or occupation order.</p>

<p>You can apply online, by email or by post.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/injunction-domestic-violence">Get a court order if you’ve been the victim of domestic abuse</a>.</p>

<h2>If you don’t have settled status in the UK</h2>

<h3>Apply for settlement in your own right</h3>

<p>If your relationship with a British citizen or someone settled in the UK has broken down because of domestic abuse you may be able to apply for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-to-settle-in-uk-form-setdv" class="govuk-link">settlement as a victim of domestic violence</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-for-benefits-for-visa-holder-domestic-violence" class="govuk-link">destitution domestic violence concession</a> provides help if you are in the UK on a temporary visa as a partner, your relationship has broken down because of domestic violence and you have no money to support yourself.</p>

<h3>Apply for access to benefits</h3>

<p>The destitution domestic violence concession offers domestic abuse victims 3 months’ leave outside the immigration rules with the ability to apply for access to public funds. This provides the opportunity to gain a temporary immigration status independent of the abuser and to fund safe accommodation, where victims of domestic abuse may consider applying for indefinite leave to remain or deciding to return to their country of origin.</p>
