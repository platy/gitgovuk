<p>The UK has signed an agreement with Ukraine, which is in effect.</p>

<p>This guidance provides information on aspects of trade covered by the UK-Ukraine agreement. It is for UK businesses trading with Ukraine.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have a question about trading with Ukraine, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ask-export-support-team">ask our export support team</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>What the agreement includes </h2>

<p>This agreement includes provisions on: </p>

<ul>
  <li>trade in goods - including provisions on preferential tariffs, tariff rate quotas, rules of origin and sanitary and phytosanitary measures</li>
  <li>trade in services</li>
  <li>intellectual property, including geographical indications</li>
  <li>government procurement</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tariff rates on goods </h2>

<p>Tariff rates for bilateral trade in goods between the UK and Ukraine continue to apply as set out in the agreement. However, in some cases, the non-preferential applied rates may, in fact, be lower because of changes in the UK’s Most Favoured Nation tariff schedule.</p>

<p>You can use online tools <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-rules-tariffs-trade-with-uk">Trade with the UK</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-duties-customs-exporting">Check How to Export Goods</a> to check product-specific and country-specific information on tariffs and regulations that currently apply to UK trade in goods. These tools are regularly updated to reflect any changes.</p>

<h2>Tariff rate quotas </h2>

<p>Tariff rate quotas in the agreement have been tailored specifically to the UK.  </p>

<p>To find out the tariff rate quotas, see tables 4 and 5 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/continuing-the-uks-trade-relationship-with-ukraine-parliamentary-report">parliamentary report</a>.   </p>

<h2>Rules of origin  </h2>

<h3>Finding the correct rule of origin for export</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of good you are seeking to export, in order to claim preferential treatment it will need to be either wholly obtained or sufficiently processed.</p>

<p>To be considered sufficiently processed your good will need to meet the relevant product specific rule (<abbr title="product specific rule">PSR</abbr>). The <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> for this agreement use the 2007 version of the Harmonised System (<abbr title="Harmonised System">HS</abbr>) nomenclature. You should apply the <abbr title="product specific rule">PSR</abbr> for your good using the code in which it was classified under this nomenclature.</p>

<p>In a limited number of cases the code for your good may have changed during <abbr title="Harmonised System">HS</abbr> revisions. We are currently updating our online services to reflect these changes. In the interim correlation tables tracing these changes have been made available by the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/instrument-and-tools/hs-nomenclature-2022-edition.aspx" rel="external">World Customs Organization</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/trade/classifications/correspondence-tables.asp" rel="external">the United Nations</a></p>

<h3>Claiming preferential rates for your exports from the UK</h3>

<p>Unless you are permitted to provide an origin declaration, you will need to fill in a certificate of origin to claim preferential treatment.</p>

<p>The UK continues to use the EUR1 and EUR-MED format for movement certificates with trade partners that have mutual free trade agreements (<abbr title="free trade agreements">FTAs</abbr>) with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, including Ukraine. These movement certificates are identical to those previously in use, but the place of origin on the certificate is now marked as the United Kingdom instead of the European Community. EUR1 and EUR-MED certificates of origin that have been updated to show the UK are now available from your usual provider, such as the chambers of commerce.</p>

<p>If you previously used the EUR1 form with a mutual <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trading partner, you can use the new EUR1 form that shows the UK as the place of origin. If you previously used the EUR-MED form with a mutual <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trading partner, you can use the new EUR-MED form that shows the UK as the place of origin.</p>

<h3>Using <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> materials and processing in your exports to Ukraine</h3>

<p>You can use <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> materials or processing in your exports to Ukraine. The UK and Ukraine must have fulfilled the necessary requirements set out in the Rules of Origin Protocol. You must also ensure the working or processing you do in the UK goes beyond the minimal operations listed in the agreement and that the other relevant conditions are met.</p>

<p>For example, you cannot simply package or label a product from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and export it to Ukraine as a good originating in the UK.</p>

<p>See the list of minimal operations in Article 7 of the Rules of Origin Protocol in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukukraine-political-free-trade-and-strategic-partnership-agreement-cs-ukraine-no12020">UK-Ukraine agreement</a>.</p>

<p>The ability to consider materials from, or processing carried out in, another country as originating when incorporated into your product is called cumulation. </p>

<h3>Using materials and/or processing from other countries in your exports to Ukraine</h3>

<p>If both the UK and Ukraine have an agreement with one of the other countries provided for in the Rules of Origin Protocol, you can continue using materials, and in some cases processing, from that country in your exports to Ukraine. You must ensure that the working or processing you do in the UK goes beyond the minimal operations listed in the agreement and that the other relevant conditions are fulfilled.</p>

<h3>Sending your goods to Ukraine through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and other countries</h3>

<p>Goods transited through the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> – and any other country with whom cumulation is applicable – are not subject to the same restrictions as those in transit through other third countries.</p>

<p>For example, you can split a consignment in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> when exporting goods to Ukraine, provided the goods comprising the consignment have not been entered into free circulation in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Transit through any other third country is possible provided your goods remain under customs surveillance and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.</p>

<h3>Goods in transit and retrospective certificates of origin</h3>

<p>If your goods were in transit when the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-Ukraine agreement ceased to apply to the UK, you can obtain a retrospective certificate of origin. This shows that the goods originated in the UK and are eligible for preferential terms if your goods arrived on, or within 12 months after the UK-Ukraine agreement started to apply.</p>

<p>You can get retrospective certificates of origin from your usual provider.</p>

<h2>Intellectual property and geographical indications </h2>

<h3>Intellectual property</h3>

<p>The UK and Ukraine have agreed that the rights of an author of a literary or artistic work shall run for the life of the author and for not less than 70 years after their death. This ensures continued protection of copyright.</p>

<h3>Geographical Indications</h3>

<p>Geographical Indications (<abbr title="Geographical indicators">GIs</abbr>) protect the geographical names of food, drink and agricultural products.</p>

<p>Both the UK and Ukraine’s existing <abbr title="Geographical indicators">GIs</abbr> remain covered by this agreement.</p>

<p>The following ‘transborder <abbr title="Geographical indicators">GIs</abbr>’ that relate to the territory of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, are protected in this agreement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Irish Whisky/Irish Whiskey/Uisce Beatha Eireannach</li>
  <li>Irish Poteen/Irish Poitín</li>
  <li>Irish Cream</li>
</ul>
