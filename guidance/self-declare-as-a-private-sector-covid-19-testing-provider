<p>The government has published this guidance on the minimum standards for private sector providers of COVID-19 testing.</p>

<p>To request to be added to the indicative list of providers on GOV.UK, providers must declare that they meet these minimum standards by <a href="#form" class="govuk-link">completing the form</a>, as well as providing some additional information to support our due diligence checks.</p>

<p>The government envisages that <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> (UK Accreditation Service) accreditation will become a minimum standard for all private sector providers of COVID-19 testing at a future stage and is planned to be established by September 2021.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.ukas.com/the-route-to-accreditation/how-to-apply/" class="govuk-link">Further information on the <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation process</a> is available on the <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> website.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>The current minimum standards are summarised as follows (more detail is provided in the form):</p>

<h3 id="requirement-of-a-clinical-or-medical-director-or-equivalent-and-healthcare-scientist">1. Requirement of a clinical or medical director or equivalent and healthcare scientist</h3>
<p>The provider must have a designated resourced role that has oversight and approval of medical or clinical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting medical/clinical issues. The individual shall be registered with a clinical regulatory body, for example, the General Medical Council, Health and Care Professions Council, etc.</p>

<p>Additionally, the provider shall employ a regulated healthcare scientist who is registered with the Health and Care Professions Council. These can be the same individual, providing both roles are satisfied</p>

<h3 id="use-of-ce-marked-tests-that-have-a-ukeuropean-based-authorised-representative-and-are-registered-in-the-country-where-that-representative-is-based">2. Use of CE-marked tests that have a UK/European-based authorised representative and are registered in the country where that representative is based</h3>

<p>A CE mark is a logo that is placed on an in vitro diagnostic (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic">IVD</abbr>) medical device to show that it conforms to the requirements of the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC, as implemented by the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (note: it is an offence under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to place a device on the market or supply with without a CE mark, unless a derogation has been obtain from <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> under regulation 12(4) of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002).</p>

<p>A CE mark shows that the device is fit for its intended purpose stated and meets legislative requirements relating to safety.</p>

<h3 id="alignment-to-dhsc-mhra-target-product-profile-scope">3. Alignment to DHSC <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> target product profile scope</h3>
<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) has published target product profiles (<abbr title="target product profiles">TPPs</abbr>) for different types of test, setting out the ‘scope’ of what that test should be used for, including target use, target user and target use settings.</p>

<p>The provider must declare that they’re using the test in line with its published scope. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has set out guidance explaining how both virus and antibody tests work.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="public-health-england-phe-data-reporting-system">4. Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) data reporting system</h3>
<p>The provider must have a system in place for reporting positive, and negative and inconclusive test results cases to <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> in accordance with public health legislation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/739854/PHE_Laboratory_Reporting_Guidelines.pdf" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> guidance for reporting notifiable diseases</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relevant-systems-in-place-to-report-adverse-test-incidents">5. Relevant systems in place to report adverse test incidents</h3>

<p>The provider must be able to demonstrate that it has systems in place to identify any adverse incidents or quality control issues and be able to report them in a timely manner to the relevant regulatory body. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has a dedicated COVID-19 Yellow Card portal to report adverse incidents with medicines, medical devices and diagnostics.</p>

<p><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has published target product profiles (<abbr title="target product profiles">TPPs</abbr>) for different types of test, which outlines who should collect test samples under the ‘Target User’ description.</p>

<p>The provider must have relevant competency-based trained test operators undertaking or overseeing sample collection dependent on test sample collection requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.GOV.UK/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work/for-industry-and-manufactures-covid-19-tests-and-testing-kits" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="target product profiles">TPPs</abbr></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The ISO standard and technical specifications set out the key components that should be considered to provide safe and reliable sample collection service.</p>

<p>It is expected that <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation to ISO 15189 or ISO/IEC 17025 will become a mandatory minimum standard by June 2021.</p>

<p>Sampling can be accredited as part of a wider lab-based activity, or sampling can be the scope of a standalone, separately accredited legal entity.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="clinical-governance">7. Clinical governance</h3>
<p>The provider must have clear clinical governance procedures in place. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear governance and lines of accountability such as senior responsible officer, clinical lead, quality lead, training lead</li>
  <li>staff are appropriately trained and there is evidence of competency assessment and participation in relevant external quality assessment (<abbr title="external quality assessment">EQA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>liability and indemnity cover for staff</li>
  <li>a verification report for the laboratory element of the test (known as the assay), in line with national protocols for laboratory-based testing</li>
  <li>information management systems to monitor sample delivery and tracking</li>
  <li>systems to meet the provisions for handling, transportation and analysis of test samples</li>
  <li>working to containment level CL3 or CL2+ with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) approval for laboratory-based testing</li>
  <li>systems, processes and record management to support the delivery of safe and reliable service</li>
</ul>

<p>Private providers must tell employers of any positive results for COVID-19, and employers must inform relevant staff to self-isolate. For more information on what employers should do in the case of a positive test result, please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers" class="govuk-link">employer guidance</a>.</p>

<p>For polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) testing, all samples must be processed by a <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited laboratory, or <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> applicant laboratory (the laboratory has applied for <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation but has not yet achieved it), and have quality management systems operating according to ISO 15189 and/or ISO/IEC 17025. ISO 15189 is the standard used in all NHS laboratories.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of laboratories. This accreditation is an important element in establishing and maintaining confidence in a testing service. The government envisages that <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation will become a mandatory minimum standard for all private sector providers of COVID-19 testing at a future stage and is planned to be established by June 2021.</p>
