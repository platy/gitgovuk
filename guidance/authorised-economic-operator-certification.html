<p>From 1 October, you will not be able to make import declarations on the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (CHIEF) system.</p>

<p>If you import goods, you need use the Customs Declaration Service. It can take time for your businesses to complete the move and the sooner you start the easier it will be.</p>

<p>If you already make import declarations using CHIEF, we have transferred your existing customs authorisations to the Customs Declaration Service. You do not need to apply for a new authorisation to use the Customs Declaration Service if you already hold an active authorisation. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to make declarations on Customs Declaration Service, use the reference number we have given you</li>
  <li>your existing authorisation letter remains valid</li>
</ul>

<p>Find out more information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/customs-declaration-service">Customs Declaration Service</a>.</p>

<p>You need to be part of the international supply chain, which starts from the manufacturing process through to delivery of goods using the import and export procedures</p>

<h3>If you’re a trader in Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>All Northern Ireland Authorised Economic Operator authorisations will continue to be recognised in the EU.</p>

<p>To be eligible to hold a Northern Ireland authorisation, you need to be:</p>

  <li>have an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number beginning with XI</li>
  <li>a person who in the course of their business is involved in activities covered by customs legislation in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checks HMRC will carry out against the criteria</h2>

<p>HMRC will carry out the checks below to see if you meet the criteria for receiving the status. All businesses must meet the criteria. These checks will take place after you’ve applied and HMRC will take into account the size, nature and complexity of the business when carrying out the assessment.</p>

<p>Approval for Authorised Economic Operator status involves audit visits from HMRC staff. Before you apply make sure you’re ready for our officers to attend your premises. We’ll call you shortly after your application has been accepted to arrange these visits.</p>

<h3>Tax and customs compliance</h3>

<p>We’ll check your business has complied with tax and customs rules over the last 3 years. If your business has been running for less than 3 years, we’ll use the latest available information. We need to know if there have been any serious or repeated breaches of customs rules.</p>

<p>You’ll need to show evidence that you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>procedures that identify and report any customs irregularities or errors to us</li>
  <li>taken appropriate action to deal with any irregularities</li>
  <li>procedures that report any customs business changes to us</li>
  <li>clear procedures for handling controlled goods</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customs record keeping</h3>

<p>We’ll ask to see an efficient system for managing commercial and in some cases, transport records.</p>

<p>When applying for the status you’ll need to provide evidence that you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a well-maintained logistics system with a full audit trail</li>
  <li>methods to allow us to access your customs records</li>
  <li>a logical administrative system</li>
  <li>documented procedures to manage the flow of goods</li>
  <li>internal controls that detect illegal or irregular transactions</li>
  <li>procedures to handle licences and authorisations</li>
  <li>archive and retrieval procedures in place</li>
  <li>trained staff to tell us of any system errors</li>
  <li>procedures for checking customs declarations submitted by third parties on your behalf</li>
  <li>Information Technology security measures in place</li>
</ul>

<p>If you make declarations on behalf of others you’ll need to provide evidence that you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understood your contractual responsibilities and obtain written instructions from business partners</li>
  <li>understood your legal responsibilities if acting in the capacity as an indirect or direct representative</li>
  <li>processes for choosing business partners</li>
  <li>documented procedures to validate the valuation, classification and origin of goods</li>
  <li>procedures to manage or review relationships with clients who are non compliant</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a small or medium sized business, you do not need complex systems, but they must be appropriate to the size, nature and complexity of the business.</p>

<h3>Proven financial solvency</h3>

<p>We’ll check the financial records of your business covering the last 3 years. This is to make sure you have the ability to meet your commitments to both us and other creditors.</p>

<p>If you have traded for less than 3 years you can still apply.</p>

<p>We’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>see your full management accounts and projections</li>
  <li>see your letter of conformity from your chartered accountant or bank</li>
  <li>check if your business is subject to bankruptcy proceedings or liquidation</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect your current net assets to be positive. We’ll take into account any special circumstances that mean it’s normal for you to have any net negative assets.</p>

<p>If your business is not required to file accounts, you can provide other financial statements to show us your proven financial solvency.</p>

<h3>Practical standards of competence or professional qualifications</h3>

<p>Before you make your customs simplification application, you must be able to show and give evidence of practical competence in customs matters for the previous 3 years. You’ll need to give evidence of how you’ve maintained the roles, responsibilities and competences.</p>

<p>If your business has been running for less than 3 years, we’ll use the latest available information.</p>

<p>If you have a small business, you must have at least one person with responsibility for customs matters. This can be part of their role and not dedicated solely to customs.</p>

<p>You can use a customs agent to deal with your customs matters. You must be able to give accurate information so the agent can complete declarations on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Security and safety</h3>

<p>When applying for this status, we’ll check the procedures you’ve put in place to protect your business and the supply chain from any risks. You’ll need to make sure your procedures are robust and appropriate to the size and nature of your business. For example, a small business with a secure outer fence and intercom may not need full time security staff.</p>

<p>If you apply for this status you’ll need to show evidence that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a safety and security risk assessment in place</li>
  <li>have secured external boundaries with documented procedures to control access to your premises</li>
  <li>have measures in place to inspect and protect your cargo units</li>
  <li>prevent unauthorised access to shipping areas, loading docks and cargo areas</li>
  <li>check the security and safety of your goods during storage, manufacture and transport</li>
  <li>agree appropriate safety and security measures with your suppliers</li>
  <li>carry out security screening and procedures for prospective employees and contracted parties</li>
  <li>train your staff in the security and safety requirements</li>
  <li>have contracts for temporary personnel</li>
  <li>have details of owners of cargo units</li>
  <li>have all outsourcing contracts (including cleaning, security, maintenance and any others)</li>
  <li>regularly check and review your processes</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also provide evidence when we visit, that you have a safety and security certificate from one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an international convention</li>
  <li>an international standard of the International Organisation for Standardisation</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regulated agent</li>
  <li>known consignor</li>
  <li>International ship and port facility security (ISPS)</li>
  <li>secure operator</li>
</ul>

<p>The criteria for the issue of a security and safety authorisation are deemed to be met for those areas which are covered by that status.</p>

<p>If you hold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an internationally recognised security and safety certificate issued on the basis of international conventions</li>
  <li>a relevant International Standard of the international Organisation for standardisation,</li>
  <li>a European Standard of the European Standards Organisations</li>
  <li>other internationally recognised security and safety certificates</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC will take them into account in assessing the level of checks needed to verify the <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> criteria</p>

<p>This means we may be able to carry out less checks on your application.</p>

<p>We’ll expect you to have a strong recruitment policy that stands up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>You should have a pre-employment check in place for all staff. This should cover the previous 3 years at least. You’ll need to show evidence of this.</p>

<p>A regulated agent or known consignor should have a 5 year employment history check.</p>

<p>If an employee is in a security sensitive position or a high risk area, they must have received security screening. The same level of background checks apply to agency workers you employ.</p>

<h2>Before you apply</h2>

<p>You must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read and understood the criteria and checks involved</li>
  <li>gathered the information you’ll need to answer the questions</li>
  <li>your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori"><abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number</a>
</li>
  <li>responsible customs managers and specific personnel available onsite for the audit visits</li>
  <li>documented procedures available</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>A responsible person, for example a Director, within the business should apply for the status. You’ll need to give up to date evidence of the person’s role, responsibilities and competences.</p>

<p>To meet the criteria, you must have evidence of your business procedure and processes. We’ll visit you to check your documentation and test your systems. The evidence of your business meeting the criteria should be available to see on our visits. Make sure your business is ready for the visits before you apply.</p>

<p>If you’re a group of companies, you need to submit separate applications for each legal entity.</p>

<p>There is no provision to grant <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> status to a specific site, division or branch of your legal entity. Your application must cover all the activities and locations of your legal entity involved in the international trade supply chain and the <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> criteria will be applied across all those activities and locations.</p>

<p>A parent company outside the UK can apply in the UK with the branch authorised as a permanent business establishment.</p>

<p>A branch may apply if it proves to be a legal person in its own right, for example if it is authorised to enter into contracts independently from its parent company in a third country.</p>

<p>If contracts are with the parent company in the third country rather than the office or branch in the UK, the parent company should make the application for <abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr> on the basis that it has a permanent business establishment in the UK.</p>

<p>After we receive your application, we’ll carry out our checks and aim to visit you as soon as possible. The status can take up to 120 days to approve.</p>
