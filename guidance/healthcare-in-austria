<p>This information is about living in Austria. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Austria.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Austria has a state health insurance fund (Österreichische Gesundheitskasse) that you pay into each month to access state healthcare.</p>

<p>You may still have to pay on top of this to use some parts of the healthcare system.</p>

<p>At the moment, UK nationals usually access the Austrian healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying for state health insurance through your employer</li>
  <li>paying for state health insurance directly</li>
  <li>using a UK-issued EHIC for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued S1 with the state insurance fund</li>
</ul>

<p>The S1 certificate entitles UK nationals access to state healthcare on the same basis as an Austrian citizen. You’re entitled to an S1 if you receive a UK State Pension or certain other benefits. <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">Find out more about the S1.</a></p>

<h2 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period">Healthcare during the transition period</h2>
<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals visiting or living in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC during this time, as you did before.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Austria or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Austria as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency. This guidance explains what you need to do in Austria depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-if-you-live-and-work-in-austria">Healthcare if you live and work in Austria</h2>
<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> if you’re living in Austria.</p>

<p>If you’re employed or self-employed in Austria it’s compulsory to have health insurance.</p>

<p>If you’re not working, you should take out voluntary insurance.</p>

<p>You can add your dependants to your insurance plan.</p>

<p>Your insurance begins on the day you took out the insurance, but there can be a waiting period of 6 months before you can claim any benefits from your insurer.</p>

<p>There will not be a 6-month wait if you were already resident in Austria and you were insured in another way, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the 6 weeks before you took out insurance</li>
  <li>for 26 weeks at any point in the year before you took out insurance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-register">How to register</h3>
<p>You first need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-austria" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll be signed up automatically for healthcare insurance if you’re employed.</p>

<p>If not, contact the local branch of the Österreichische Gesundheitskasse.</p>

<p>Once you’ve registered you will be given a card called an ‘e-card’. Show this when you visit a doctor.  You do not need to register with a doctor in Austria.</p>

<p>This card also gives you access to online services. Your EHIC is on the back.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-youll-pay">How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>Your monthly payment increases with your salary and varies across Austria.
Look for a doctor’s surgery that says:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kassenarzt (‘contracted doctor’)</li>
  <li>Alle Kassen (‘all insurers’)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not have to pay to see these doctors.</p>

<p>You will still have to pay for some medical services, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20% of the cost of seeing a private doctor – your insurance scheme should reimburse the rest</li>
  <li>a fee of around 10 to 15 euros for each of your first 28 days in hospital</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-you-live-and-work-in-austria">Healthcare during the transition period if you live and work in Austria</h3>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Austria or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Austria as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>This means you’ll also have the right to apply for a <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="posted-worker">If your UK employer has sent you to Austria temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad/posted-workers" class="govuk-link">posted worker</a> is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to another European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>Currently, posted workers can use an EHIC or an S1 certificate to access Austrian healthcare.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. This can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-youre-a-posted-worker">Healthcare during the transition period if you’re a posted worker</h3>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC or S1 during this time, as you did before.</p>

<h2 id="s1">UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 in Austria</h2>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Austria and receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 if you’re a <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">posted worker</a> or a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>Once you have an S1 certificate, you must register it on the Austrian system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare on the same basis as  an Austrian citizen.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-an-s1">How to get an S1</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services
<br></br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br></br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<h3 id="how-to-use-an-s1-in-austria">How to use an S1 in Austria</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 with the state health insurance fund (called ‘Österreichische Gesundheitskasse’ in German).</p>

<p>Once registered, you’ll be given a card called an ‘e-card’. This shows that you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as an Austrian citizen.</p>

<p>Show this when you visit a doctor.</p>

<p>This card also gives you access to online services. Your EHIC is on the back.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-you-use-an-s1">Healthcare during the transition period if you use an S1</h3>

<p>There is different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK S1 holders in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020 if you’re either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone with an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>someone with another ‘exportable benefit’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re living in Austria or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Austria as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>This means that you’ll get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continued access to healthcare in Austria using your UK-issued S1</li>
  <li>a UK-issued EHIC for travelling to other countries in the EU</li>
  <li>planned treatments in other EU countries via the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">S2 route</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="moving-back-to-the-uk">Moving back to the UK</h2>
<p>If you return to the UK permanently you will be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-nhs-when-you-return-to-live-in-the-uk" class="govuk-link">using the NHS when you return to live in the UK</a>.</p>

<h2 id="studying-in-austria">Studying in Austria</h2>
<p>You can apply for a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/" class="govuk-link">student EHIC</a>. This is different from a normal EHIC, and entitles you to cover for longer.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for travel insurance. You should also have insurance to cover the duration of your course.</p>

<p>You can also choose to register for state health insurance and pay the student rate. You’ll need to register as a resident first.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-youre-studying-in-austria">Healthcare during the transition period if you’re studying in Austria</h3>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC during this time, as you did before.</p>

<p>If you started studying in Austria before the end of 2020, your student EHIC will be valid for the rest of the time you study there.</p>
