<h3>1.4 Health and Safety</h3>

<p>You must comply with all the legal provisions relating to health and safety such as the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. These provisions may include the need to display warning notices and to issue health and safety instructions to both staff and visitors.</p>

<p>If you issue special equipment or protective clothing to your staff when they are undertaking activities such as handling, inspecting or sampling fuel then you must provide similar clothing and equipment to us when we undertake the same activities.</p>

<h2>2. Relief Scheme</h2>

<h3>2.1 Background</h3>

<p>The Hydrocarbon Oil Duties (Reliefs for Electricity Generation) regulations 2005 allows for a relief from fuel duty on oils used in electricity generation. It was introduced on 1 January 2006 to make sure the tax treatment of oils used in electricity generation is broadly consistent with other energy products used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>In order to encourage investment in low carbon power generation, the government introduced a carbon price floor (<abbr title="carbon price floor">CPF</abbr>) from 1 April 2013. Supplies of coal and other solid fuels, natural gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (<abbr title="Liquefied Petroleum Gas">LPG</abbr>) used in electricity generation are liable to newly created carbon price support (<abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr>) rates of Climate Change Levy (<abbr title="Climate Change Levy">CCL</abbr>) from that date. For oils used in electricity generation from the same date, the amount of fuel duty that can be reclaimed under the Electricity Relief will be adjusted, establishing effective ‘carbon price support rates’ for oils.</p>

<h3>2.2 Claiming relief</h3>

<p>Relief must be claimed by a qualified claimant. A qualified claimant is a person who causes qualifying oil to be used to produce electricity in a generating station or to produce the outputs of a <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station.</p>

<h3>2.3 Oils that qualify for relief</h3>

<p>Oils used to generate electricity qualify for the relief if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>were put into a generator:
    <ul>
      <li>before 1 April 2022 (rebated heavy oil)</li>
      <li>on or after 1 April 2022 (full duty paid heavy oil, or rebated heavy oil used as allowed under a licence issued by HMRC and for which a payment of the rebate is made)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>are light oil (which is rebated for use as furnace fuel)</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of rebated heavy oils include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fuel oil</li>
  <li>gas oil</li>
  <li>kerosene</li>
  <li>other heavy oils such as lubricants and recovered fuel oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of rebated light oils include naphtha or condensate.</p>

<p>If you are unsure if the oil used to produce electricity qualifies for relief, contact the helpline on telephone: 0300 200 3700.</p>

<p>Biofuels used to generate electricity are also subject to relief from fuel duty. This is provided for by part 7 of the Biofuels and Other Fuel Substitutes (payment of excise duties and so on) Regulations 2004.  Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-179e-biofuels-and-other-fuel-substitutes">Excise Notice 179E</a> for guidance on how to claim relief on biofuels used to generate electricity.</p>

<h3>2.4 Form of relief</h3>

<p>Relief is given in the form of a repayment of fuel duty to the qualified claimant.</p>

<h3>2.5 Amount of duty that can be claimed</h3>

<p>For generators in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), the amount of relief which can be claimed is the amount of duty charged and paid on the qualifying oil used to produce electricity less an amount in respect of <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rates of fuel duty.</p>

<p>For generators in Northern Ireland, the amount of relief which can be claimed is the amount of duty charged and paid on the qualifying oil used to produce electricity in a generating station.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations, read section 3 of this Notice for further details.</p>

<h3>2.6 <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rates for fuel duty</h3>

<p>For Great Britain, the following rates apply.</p>

<p>For Northern Ireland, the <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rates do not apply in respect of oils used in electricity generation, regardless of if the electricity is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sent to the grid</li>
  <li>consumed in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.7 When relief is allowed</h3>

<p>Relief is allowed on quantities of qualifying oil used to generate electricity in a generating station, or the outputs of a fully or partly exempt <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station.</p>

<p>This is subject to the limitations set out in section 3 of this Notice.</p>

<p>Relief is allowed only after the oil is used to produce the electricity. Therefore, relief is not allowed on unused oil held as stock.</p>

<h4>2.7.1 Auto-generators and exempt unlicensed electricity suppliers</h4>

<p>No relief is allowed on qualifying oil used to produce electricity by an auto-generator or by an exempt unlicensed electricity supplier.</p>

<p>An ‘auto-generator’ is a person who produces electricity primarily for his own use. Electricity will be treated as primarily for own use when it is not produced by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an electricity utility or a person treated as such for the purposes of any supplies of electricity they make</li>
  <li>a person who has consumed, in the preceding 3 months, less than 75% of the electricity produced in that period</li>
</ul>

<p>An ‘exempt unlicensed electricity supplier’ is a person who is exempt from either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>section 4(1)(c) of the Electricity Act 1989 (persons supplying electricity to premises) (the exemption is granted by an order under section 5 of that Act)</li>
  <li>article 8(1)(c) of the Electricity Supply (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 (the exemption is granted by an order under Article 9 of that Order)</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies unless that person is acting otherwise than for purposes connected with the carrying on of activities authorised by the exemption.</p>

<p>However, relief is allowed when electricity produced by an auto-generator or an exempt unlicensed electricity supplier is supplied to a licensed electricity supplier (or a person treated as such under the <abbr title="Climate Change Levy">CCL</abbr> legislation). Read paragraph 2.5 for information on the amount of relief that can be claimed.</p>

<p>Auto-generators or exempt unlicensed electricity suppliers using combined heat and power stations should refer to section 3 of this Notice.</p>

<h3>2.8 How you claim relief</h3>

<p>If you are a qualified claimant you should submit your claims, including for <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations, in writing. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=akn5ivyDkSo&amp;formId=578" rel="external" title="opens in a new window">Form EX55</a> should be used for this purpose and is available from our website or from our helpline on telephone:  0300 200 3700.</p>

<p>You should also use Form EX55 to account for the <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rates of fuel duty. You should record the quantity of fuel used during the period of the claim and use the appropriate <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rate for the fuel used to calculate the total carbon price support charge. This charge will then be deducted from the amount of fuel duty on which you are claiming relief.</p>

<p>You should send the claim and supporting documentation to the following address:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

HM Revenue and Customs
<br>Mineral Oil Reliefs Centre
<br>Building 4, BP4002
<br>Benton Park View
<br>Longbenton
<br>Newcastle-upon Tyne
<br>NE98 1ZZ
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>2.9 When to claim</h3>

<p>Claims must be for a period of at least one month, but not longer than 3 years and must be made no later than 3 months after the period to which it relates. Claims cannot be made for amounts less than £50.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations, read section 3 of this Notice for further details.</p>

<h3>2.10 Evidence you need to submit with your claim</h3>

<p>You will need to include supporting documentation with your claim to demonstrate that both of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you used the oil to produce electricity</li>
  <li>the duty has been paid and is not subject to any other:
    <ul>
      <li>application</li>
      <li>claim for repayment</li>
      <li>remission</li>
      <li>drawback</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of the sort of evidence required include purchase orders, delivery notes or sales invoice, although other forms of evidence may also be accepted.</p>

<h3>2.11 Claiming the relief on rebated fuel used before 1 April 2022</h3>

<p>After 1 April 2022, if your claim for relief includes rebated fuel you used before this date, you must claim at the rebated rate. This includes when you’ve used rebated fuel that was already in your generator after 1 April 2022, before the rules changed.</p>

<p>If you’re making a claim that includes rebated and unrebated oil, you should submit the details separately on the same EX55 claim form after you’ve entered the first set of details. You do this by clicking the ‘Add’ button at the bottom of the page.</p>

<h2>3. Combined heat and power stations (<abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations)</h2>

<h3>3.1 Background</h3>

<p>This section only applies to <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations that are assessed and certified under the <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> Quality Assurance (<abbr title="combined heat and power quality assurance">CHPQA</abbr>) programme administered on behalf of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) and that are in possession of an exemption certificate issued by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ Secretary of State. A <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station that is not within the <abbr title="combined heat and power quality assurance">CHPQA</abbr> programme is normally treated, as regards electricity, as a form of electricity generation. <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations within this category may be able to claim relief on fuel duty only in the circumstances set out in paragraph 2.7.1.</p>

<p>Self-assessment and certification under <abbr title="combined heat and power quality assurance">CHPQA</abbr> programme is based on a methodology designed to assess the quality of a <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station and its qualification as a Good Quality <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station. This then determines the extent to which it is eligible to receive fiscal and other benefits. For <abbr title="Climate Change Levy">CCL</abbr>, for example, it will determine the extent to which both the input fuel used in the <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station and the corresponding outputs (direct and self-supplies of qualifying power output electricity) are relieved of <abbr title="Climate Change Levy">CCL</abbr>.</p>

<p>For full relief on input fuel, a station needs to achieve, or better, the efficiency percentage threshold of 20%. When this criterion is not met, relief from <abbr title="Climate Change Levy">CCL</abbr> is scaled back. This is calculated by applying the ‘relevant fraction’, the ratio between a station’s efficiency percentage and the threshold efficiency percentage, to supplies made to the station. A <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station is able to claim relief on oils used to generate outputs in respect of an annual operation scaled back to the same relevant fraction as entitlement to relief from <abbr title="Climate Change Levy">CCL</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations in Great Britain will also need to account for <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rates of fuel duty on oil that is referable to the production of electricity. However, from 1 April 2015 they only need to account for the <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rates on oil that is referable to electricity used on-site.</p>

<p>Electricity is used on-site if it is self-supplied or supplied to a consumer by an exempt unlicensed electricity supplier.</p>

<p>Electricity is self-supplied when the producer makes no supply of it to another person, but causes it to be consumed in the UK. This will include the parasitic load of the <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station can be an exempt unlicensed electricity supplier if it qualifies under Class A or Class C of Schedule 4 of The Electricity (Class Exemptions from the Requirement for a Licence) Order 2001.</p>

<h3>3.2 Outputs from a <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Outputs from a <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>heat</li>

<h3>3.3 Amount of relief that can be claimed</h3>

<p>If you are a fully exempt <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station, that is to say your efficiency percentage is equal to, or exceeds the threshold efficiency percentage, the amount of relief you can claim is the amount of duty charged and paid on the qualifying oil.</p>

<p>If you are a partially exempt <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> station, that is your efficiency percentage is less than the threshold efficiency percentage, the amount of relief you can claim is the amount of duty charged and paid on the qualifying oil used to produce your outputs scaled back to the relevant fraction.</p>

<p>However, the amount of relief that can be claimed is reduced, less an amount in respect of the <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rates of fuel duty.</p>

<h3>3.4 How to calculate your claim</h3>

<p>You should first apply the relevant fraction to the quantity of qualifying oil or bioblend you have used during the annual operation to which the claim refers in order to calculate the amount of fuel duty relief you are claiming. Read section 3.5 of this Notice.</p>

<p>You then need to calculate the carbon price charge for the annual operation. For the 2015 annual operation you will need to determine the quantity of qualifying oil or bioblend consumed between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 January and 31 March to produce electricity, read section 3.6 of this Notice</li>
  <li>1 April and 31 December to produce electricity used on-site, read section 3.6 of this Notice</li>
</ul>

<p>For subsequent annual operations you should apply the percentage of total fuels referable to the production of electricity used on-site during that annual operation to qualifying oil or bioblend oil consumed to produce outputs during that operation.</p>

<p>Once you have applied the <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rates to these quantities and calculated the total carbon price charge, the resulting figure will then be deducted from the amount of fuel duty relief you are claiming.</p>

<h3>3.5 What the relevant fraction is</h3>

<p>The relevant fraction is the fraction when the numerator is the efficiency percentage for the station, and the denominator is the threshold efficiency percentage for the relevant annual operation.</p>

<p>The efficiency percentage is the station’s power efficiency, as stated on its <abbr title="combined heat and power quality assurance">CHPQA</abbr> certificate.</p>

<p>For example, when in an annual operation, a station achieves an efficiency percentage of 15%, and the threshold efficiency percentage is 20 per cent, the relevant fraction is:</p>

<p>15 ÷ 20 = 75%.</p>

<h3>3.6 How to determine the quantity of oil referable to the production of electricity</h3>

<p>To establish the quantity of oil referable to the production of electricity you will need to refer to the <abbr title="combined heat and power quality assurance">CHPQA</abbr> certificate for during the annual operation to which the claim refers:</p>

<h3>3.8 <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations situated in Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="carbon price support">CPS</abbr> rates of fuel duty do not apply in respect of oils used in electricity generation in Northern Ireland, regardless of if the electricity is</p>

<ul>
  <li>sent to the grid</li>
  <li>consumed in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.9 Additional information <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations need to supply</h3>

<p><abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations need to supply a copy of their <abbr title="combined heat and power quality assurance">CHPQA</abbr> certificate and Secretary of State certificate with their claim. Failure to supply the certificates may delay the processing of claims.</p>

<h3>3.10 When <abbr title="combined heat and power">CHP</abbr> stations should make a claim</h3>

<p>Applications for relief must be in respect of an annual operation and must be made no later than nine months after the annual operation to which it relates.</p>

<p>Claims cannot be made for amounts less than £50, nor can they be made based on the previous year’s operation. This means that duty can only be claimed after the actual performance for the year is known and certified.</p>
