<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup?topic=%2Fbrexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-in-bulgaria-after-brexit">Healthcare in Bulgaria after Brexit</h2>

<p id="HealthcareBulgaria">You should prepare for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national travelling to or living in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Bulgaria in place.</p>

<p>For example, if you are a current S1 form holder, or a posted worker or student using a <a href="#EHIC">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a> you will not be able to rely on these to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-live-in-bulgaria">If you live in Bulgaria</h3>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bulgaria#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Bulgaria</a></li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Bulgaria. The UK is working with the Bulgarian authorities to clarify access to state-funded healthcare for UK nationals residing in Bulgaria after Brexit. Any policy developments will be published as soon as they become available</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency, or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>

<p>Your S1 certificate may not be valid after the UK leaves the EU. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Bulgaria and may mean you have to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-bulgaria-after-brexit">Studying in Bulgaria after Brexit</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Bulgaria and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Bulgaria before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.
To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free if you are living in Bulgaria and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>If you are living in Bulgaria before Brexit, you can use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge after exit day if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="EHIC">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Bulgaria and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>You should prepare for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national travelling to Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need.</p>

<p>If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>UK-issued EHICs will still be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="registering-for-the-bulgarian-healthcare-system">Registering for the Bulgarian healthcare system</h3>

<p>To enrol in the Bulgarian healthcare system, you must first be lawfully registered with the Ministry of Interior (MoI). You will be eligible to access state-funded healthcare based on your residency status.</p>

<p>Healthcare in Bulgaria is universal and funded by mandatory health insurance through the National Health Insurance Fund (<abbr title="National Health Insurance Fund">NHIF</abbr>). Contributions to the <abbr title="National Health Insurance Fund">NHIF</abbr> are around 3.55% of your salary for workers, 7.35% for people self-employed.
If you have a work contract, your employer will register you and transfer your monthly contributions to the authorities on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed, you will need to pay monthly healthcare contributions to the National Revenue Agency (NRA). In 2019, the minimum healthcare contribution is BGN 22.40.</p>

<p>You must register with the <abbr title="National Health Insurance Fund">NHIF</abbr> to get your Bulgarian National Health Insurance Card. You will have to present the card every time you see a doctor or dentist.</p>

<p>Once you are registered with the relevant authorities, you are entitled to state-funded healthcare. You will only have to pay the same patient contributions as a permanent resident of Bulgaria when you visit doctors and dentists who have a contract with the <abbr title="National Health Insurance Fund">NHIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information, contact the Bulgarian <abbr title="National Health Insurance Fund">NHIF</abbr>:</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Bulgaria and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants to access healthcare in Bulgaria. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you are a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit.</p>

<p>You can find more information under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>Make sure you are treated by a healthcare provider that has a contract with the Bulgarian National Health Insurance Fund (<abbr title="National Health Insurance Fund">NHIF</abbr>). An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will not cover you for private healthcare.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before you visit Bulgaria if you have a pre-existing health condition.</p>

<p>You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medicine with you.</p>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>

<p>Call 112 if you have a serious or life-threatening emergency or you need an ambulance. This number is free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>

<p>Inpatient treatment is provided by state and private hospitals. You should ask to be referred to a hospital that has a contract with the <abbr title="National Health Insurance Fund">NHIF</abbr>, as they will cover most of the cost of treatment.</p>

<p>The minimum daily charge for hospital stays in medical facilities which have a contract with the <abbr title="National Health Insurance Fund">NHIF</abbr> is BGN 5.80 for up to 10 days of your hospital stay.</p>

<p>You should be told about any additional costs you may have to cover yourself. Additionally, you can request a specific medical team, a private room or personal assistance upon additional charge.</p>

<p>After being discharged from hospital, you are entitled to a maximum of 2 free examinations as part of your inpatient care.</p>

<h3 id="dentists">Dentists</h3>

<p>You should consult a dentist who has a contract with the <abbr title="National Health Insurance Fund">NHIF</abbr>. However, you may be charged a patient contribution.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>
