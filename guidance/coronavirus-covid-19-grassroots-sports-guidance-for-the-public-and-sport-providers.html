<p><strong>The government has published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021">COVID-19 Response - Spring 2021</a> setting out the roadmap out of the current lockdown for England. This explains how restrictions will be eased over time. <br> <br> This guidance takes account of changes in the law that take effect on 29 March. It will be updated ahead of any relevant changes in the roadmap steps. Later changes, including from Step 2, are set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021" class="govuk-link">roadmap</a>.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>1. What this guidance covers</h2>

<p>Sport and physical activity play a hugely important role in our lives, however to uphold wider public health objectives, limits have been placed on some activities and settings in order to limit social contact and reduce transmission.</p>

<p>Staying active is a vital weapon against COVID-19, which is why people will always be able to, and encouraged to, exercise even during periods of tough restrictions. People should try to ensure they exercise regularly in a way that suits them, as physical activity plays a vital role in both our physical and mental wellbeing.</p>

<p>This guidance sets out information for the public and sport providers on how to participate in grassroots sport and physical activity during COVID-19 restrictions. Sport providers should use this guidance to inform how they provide grassroots sport and physical activity, alongside specific guidance for their sport set out by their national governing body. There is also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-safe-provision-including-team-sport-contact-combat-sport-and-organised-sport-events" class="govuk-link">more detailed advice</a> for national governing bodies and other organisations on how to develop their own sport-specific guidance, which includes the team sport framework, contact combat sport framework, and guidance on delivering sport participation events (such as races and organised walking groups).</p>

<h3>Understanding ‘organised sport’</h3>

<p>Where the rules mention ‘organised’ sport, this means sport which is formally organised by a qualified instructor, club, national governing body, company or charity and follows sport-specific guidance. If the sport is not organised by one of these groups (for example, some friends having a kickabout) or the sport’s NGB guidance is not being followed (for example, a football club ignoring the FA’s safety measures), this is considered to be informal or self-organised sport.</p>

<p>Taking part in organised sport sometimes means that other restrictions such as legal gathering limits don’t apply when taking part. This is because the organising body has considered the risks and set out ways to mitigate them so people can participate safely. Informal or self-organised sport is not covered by any exemptions.</p>

<h2>2. Participation in sport and physical activity: Step 1A (8 March)</h2>

<p><strong>Public outdoor recreation</strong></p>

<p>Under the national restrictions, people must stay at home and not meet others from outside their household (or support/childcare bubble), except for a limited number of legally permitted reasons, such as essential work that cannot be done from home, and exercise and recreation.</p>

<p>People can leave their homes to take part in exercise or recreation (such as a picnic) in an outdoor public place. This should be limited to once per day, in their local area. They can do this alone, with their household or support bubble, in a childcare bubble (where providing childcare) or with 1 person from another household (one-to-one). Children under 5, and up to 2 carers for a person with a disability who needs continuous care, are not counted towards the gathering limit on two or more people exercising and undertaking recreation outside.</p>

<p>People with health conditions that routinely require them to leave the home to maintain their health can do so (with a carer if necessary), including if that involves travel beyond the local area or exercise multiple times a day.</p>

<p><strong>Sport for educational purposes and wraparound care</strong></p>

<p>Pupils and students in all schools and further education settings returned to face-to-face education on 8 March. Schools and colleges have the flexibility to decide how physical education, sport and physical activity will be provided while following the measures in their system of controls. Pupils should be kept in consistent groups, with sports equipment thoroughly cleaned between each use by different individual groups. You can find more information in the Department for Education <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">guidance on actions for schools</a>.</p>

<p>Wraparound childcare (including childminders) and other children’s activities can take place for all children where it is needed to enable parents or carers to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group. Vulnerable children can attend these settings regardless of circumstances.</p>

<p>Except as set out in the next section, sport for under-18s can only take place at school as part of educational provision, or as part of wraparound care, and should not otherwise take place at this time.</p>

<p>Schools are able to use external facilities for school sport and to invite external coaches onto the school site to deliver school sport. You can find more information in the Department for Education <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">guidance for activity in out-of-school settings</a>.</p>

<p>Competition between different schools should not take place until wider grassroots sport for under-18s is permitted in step 1B (from 29th March).</p>

<p><strong>People with disabilities</strong></p>

<p>People with disabilities can participate in organised outdoor sport without being subject to social contact limits. Non-disabled people are not permitted to participate, except where necessary to enable the sport to take place (such as a carer or coach helping the disabled person to participate).</p>

<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>

<p>All indoor and outdoor sport facilities are currently closed, and cannot be used for exercise or recreation. People can exercise or take part in recreational activity only in an outdoor public place. People should stay within their local area (for example, within the village, town, or part of the city where they live), and should not travel to take part in exercise or recreation.</p>

<p>Public outdoor places include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public, forests</li>
  <li>public and botanical gardens (whether or not you pay to enter them)</li>
  <li>the grounds of a heritage site</li>
  <li>public playgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>Sport facilities can open for some purposes including sport for educational purposes, sport as part of wraparound childcare and for elite sport. You can find more information in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/providers-of-grassroots-sport-and-gym-leisure-facilities" class="govuk-link">guidance for sport facilities</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Travelling for sport</strong></p>

<p>Until Step 1B (29 March) the ‘Stay at Home’ restriction will be in place. This means you must not leave home without a reasonable excuse. When leaving your home for permitted reasons, you should stay local and minimise time spent outside your home. This means you should avoid travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live. You should reduce the number of journeys you make overall.</p>

<p><strong>Personal training and coaching</strong></p>

<p>Personal training and coaching can continue, where this is 1:1, 2:1 with someone from another household, or in your bubble or household. The personal trainer or coach is exempt from the legal gathering limits for work purposes. This should only take place in a public outdoor place, and not in someone’s private home or garden.</p>

<p>Social distancing should be maintained between people who do not live together or share a support/childcare bubble.</p>

<p>Coaching education and training courses can be delivered through the education exemption.</p>

<h2>3. Participation in sport and physical activity: Step 1B (29 March)</h2>

<p>From 29 March, the rules on social contact will change. People will not be required to stay at home, and will be permitted to meet outdoors in groups of up to 6 people, or as a group of two households, for exercise or recreation.</p>

<p>A group made up of two households can include more than 6 people, but only where all members of the group are from the same two households (or support/childcare bubbles, where eligible). Social distancing must be maintained between people who do not live together or share a support bubble.</p>

<p><strong>Organised outdoor sport</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Outdoor sport for adults and children is permitted in larger numbers, provided it is formally organised (for example, by a national governing body or a qualified instructor - see the <a href="#organised-sport" class="govuk-link">section on understanding ‘organised sport’</a> for more information) and follows COVID-secure guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organised sport and supervised children’s sport and physical activity can take place outdoors in any number, but people should maintain the rules on social contact before and after sporting activity. This applies to organised outdoor (individual and team) sports, outdoor exercise classes, organised sports participation events and outdoor licensed physical activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Participants should adhere to social distancing when not actively participating (e.g. during breaks in play, or when awaiting substitutions). Social interaction before and after playing any sport should only take place outdoors, and in separate and distinct groups consisting of up to 6 people or two households.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sports which require participants to be in frequent close proximity to each other (such as rugby league, rugby union, netball, contact combat sports) should adapt both training and game-play to reduce the level of contact so far as reasonably possible and take steps to minimise risk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where sport is not formally organised, it can only take place within the rules on social contact above - in groups of up to 6 people, or two households.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Specific sports and activities</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Personal training is permitted outdoors, in outdoor sport facilities, and in private gardens, where it is formally organised and follows COVID-secure guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact combat sports can resume outdoors at phase 2 of the contact combat sports framework for children and phase 1 for adults. Indoors, contact combat sports can resume for children only at phase 2 of the framework as part of sport for educational purposes or wrap-around care. You can find more information in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-safe-provision-including-team-sport-contact-combat-sport-and-organised-sport-events" class="govuk-link">guidance on safe provision of grassroots sport (including the contact combat sport framework)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organised sport participation events such as races and organised walks can take place outdoors and are exempt from legal gathering limits. However they must be organised in accordance with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-safe-provision-including-team-sport-contact-combat-sport-and-organised-sport-events" class="govuk-link">guidance for the safe provision of grassroots sport (including organised sport participation events)</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sport facilities</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Outdoor sport facilities can reopen, and can be used for sport, physical activity and exercise. This applies to all outdoor sport facilities, including but not limited to outdoor gyms, swimming pools, courts, pitches, golf courses (including mini-golf), water sports venues, climbing walls, driving and shooting ranges, riding arenas at riding centres and archery venues. Outdoor skating rinks and trampolining parks must remain closed. Gathering limits must be adhered to unless being used to facilitate organised sport.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indoor sport and physical activity is not permitted and indoor sport facilities must remain closed, except for specific groups (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#specific-groups">section on guidance for specific groups</a> below).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changing rooms should not be used, except by people with disabilities, although toilet facilities can be accessed. You should inform customers that these are areas of increased risk, that they should shower and change at home where possible, and those that do need to use changing rooms should minimise time spent inside.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spectators</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Spectators are not permitted in any indoor or outdoor sport facility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This does not apply to carers for people with disabilities, or adults needed to supervise under-18s in a safeguarding role. Where it is necessary for them to be present, supervising adults should not mix with others from outside their household or support bubble.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Guidance for specific groups</strong></p>

<p><strong>Elite sport</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Elite athletes and their support staff can use indoor and outdoor sport facilities for training and competition. Elite sport events can continue to take place in sport facilities, where permitted in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-phased-return-of-sport-and-recreation">guidance on elite sport</a>.</li>
  <li>Professional dancers and choreographers can use indoor and outdoor dance studios, fitness studios and skating rinks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>People with disabilities</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>People with disabilities can participate in organised outdoor and indoor sport without being subject to social contact limits.</li>
  <li>Non-disabled people are not permitted to participate, except where necessary to enable the activity to take place (such as a carer or coach helping the disabled person to exercise).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sport for educational purposes</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Indoor facilities can be used by schools and post-16 education and training providers (such as colleges and universities), for organised sport or individual fitness activities related to their curriculum. This could include running an indoor basketball session for a school group, or a sport science student training for their sport in a gym.</li>
  <li>Indoor organised sport is permitted where it is part of formal education, and can take place indoors if necessary, but outdoor provision should be prioritised.</li>
  <li>Indoor sport for under-18s can also take place at school as part of educational provision, or as part of wraparound care.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Activities for children (or those who were under 18 on 31 August 2020)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Indoor sport and physical activity for children is permitted, where this is part of wraparound childcare which enables parents or carers to work, seek work, attend education, seek medical care or attend a support group. 
Indoor sport and physical activity for vulnerable children is permitted, regardless of whether this is part of wraparound care.</li>
  <li>Parent and child groups can also take place outdoors with a limit of 15 attendees (children under 5 do not count towards the attendee limit).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traveling for sport</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Always check that it is safe to travel before you set out to take part in sport or recreation.</li>
  <li>You should minimise travel wherever possible, but you can travel to exercise and take part in informal and organised sport, where necessary. You should not stay away from home overnight for sport and physical activity.</li>
  <li>You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">guidance on safer travel</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. How to participate safely</h2>

<h3>Check for COVID-19 symptoms and health conditions</h3>

<p>Before attending any sporting activities, all participants, officials, volunteers and spectators must self-assess for COVID-19 symptoms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A high temperature</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new, continuous cough</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A loss of, or change to, their sense of smell or taste</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have one or more of these symptoms you should not attend any sporting activity, and must follow <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">NHS and PHE guidance on self-isolation</a>.</p>

<p>People with health conditions that put them at increased risk should consider the risks of participating in group activities like sport and physical activity.</p>

<h3>Check if your sport is safe to play, and if there are modifications</h3>

<p>Before participating in any sporting activity, you should check whether your sport is safe to play. Every sport’s national governing body should have published guidance on how to participate safely. You should ensure you are following the national governing body’s latest guidance, and follow any measures put in place by the sport provider or event organiser, even where this means modifications to the game.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Additional measures (team sport, contact combat sport)</strong></p>

<p>There are additional measures for team sports and contact combat sports (such as boxing, wrestling and martial arts). These sports should have their action plans approved before they can resume contact activity (advice for sports on how to do this is set out in the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-safe-provision-including-team-sport-contact-combat-sport-and-organised-sport-events">safe provision of grassroots sport</a>). If you want to participate in a team sport or a contact combat sport, you should check whether its guidance has been approved (sports which have received approval are listed at the bottom of the page).</p>

<p><strong>If the sport is listed, the sport’s guidance has been approved.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Matches, games and training sessions can take place in any number where they are organised by a qualified instructor, club, national governing body, company or charity and follow the NGB’s guidance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If the sport is not listed, it is not yet considered to be an organised sport.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Team sports: you can only participate within the legal gathering limits (outdoors, in a group of up to 6 people, or as a group of two households).</strong> A group made up of two households can include more than 6 people, but only where all members of the group are from the same two households (or support/childcare bubbles, where eligible). Social distancing must be maintained between people who do not live together or share a bubble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Contact combat sports: you should not participate</strong> in contact combat sports in any number until they have been approved.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This additional measure does not apply to all sports.</strong> Sports in which people primarily compete as individuals (such as tennis or golf) are not listed as they do not need to submit their action plans for approval, but you should ensure you are following the sport’s published guidance on how to participate safely.</p>
</div>

<h3>Spectators</h3>

<p>Spectators are not currently permitted at organised sport activities.</p>

<p>This does not apply to carers for people with disabilities, or adults needed to supervise under-18s in a safeguarding role. Where it is necessary for them to be present, supervising adults should not mix with others from outside their household or support bubble.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>What you should do (when spectators are permitted):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that spectators adhere to the legal gathering limits. In addition to being legal requirements punishable by fines, those violating the measures are endangering public safety and undermining the case for safe sport to be allowed to continue to take place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If spectators do not follow these legal requirements, you (or the sport provider) can ask them to leave or not to attend again. Where there are serious or consistent issues with spectators, the sport’s national governing body may consider sanctions including suspending the relevant sport provider from running any leagues, matches, training sessions or other events or activities until this has been addressed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social distancing should be maintained by people who do not live together (or share a support/childcare bubble).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spectators should minimise shouting or raising their voices. There is an additional risk of infection where people are shouting or singing in close proximity to others (particularly indoors or when face-to face).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Match officials, medics and coaches</h3>

<p>Match officials, medics and coaches should observe the relevant guidance in the same way as participants. Where legal gathering limits apply, people participating in a work or volunteering capacity (such as match officials, medics and coaches) are exempt and therefore not included in the number of participants. However they must remain socially distanced from players where possible during play. Should match officials not be able to remain socially distanced due to their role in the sport, the sport’s national governing body or local provider should conduct a risk assessment to see if other mitigations may be necessary.</p>

<p>Match officials will be empowered to ensure that COVID-secure measures are adhered to, and to enforce this through appropriate sanctions set out by the sport’s national governing body or event organiser.</p>

<h2>5. Additional guidance for sport providers</h2>

<h3>Guidance and approval</h3>

<p>All national governing bodies and organised sport providers must undertake a risk assessment for their sport or activity and publish guidance on how people can participate safely, including any modifications required to training or game-play. This should be updated when needed to reflect any relevant changes to measures such as gathering limits. This should be provided by your national governing body (NGB) or organised sport provider or found on their website; you should check to ensure you are following the latest guidance and taking appropriate measures.</p>

<p>Organised sport providers must ensure they follow their NGB’s guidance and have the appropriate measures in place to offer their sport safely. Each provider should undertake their own risk assessment, including ensuring that operators, organisers and volunteers are aware of modifications to game-play or activity structure. They should also write their own action plan to be distributed to all relevant personnel, including coaches and welfare officers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Action plan approval</strong></p>

<p>Some sports need to have their plans approved before people can participate in them as organised sports.</p>

<p><strong>Team sports and contact combat sports must submit their action plans for approval.</strong> You can find more detailed advice in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-safe-provision-including-team-sport-contact-combat-sport-and-organised-sport-events" class="govuk-link">guidance for safe provision of grassroots sport</a>, which includes the team sport framework, contact combat sport framework, and guidance on delivering sport participation events (such as races and organised walking groups).</p>

<p><strong>Sports in which people primarily compete as individuals (such as tennis or golf) do not need to submit their action plans for approval.</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>NHS Test and Trace</h3>

<p>Many sport providers and facilities are required to keep a record of all visitors, customers and staff on the premises, to support NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clubs providing team sport activities</li>
  <li>outdoor swimming pools and lidos</li>
  <li>sport and massage therapists</li>
</ul>

<p>However this does not apply to all facilities (for example, outdoor sport facilities in public places where it is not possible or practical to collect information from all spectators), so you should check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">NHS Test and Trace guidance</a> to see if this applies to you.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>What you need to do</strong></p>

<p>If this applies to you, you are required to keep such a record and you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ask at least one member of every party of customers or visitors (up to 6 people) to provide their name and contact details.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep a record of all staff working on your premises and shift times</strong> on a given day, and their contact details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep these records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days</strong> and provide data to NHS Test and Trace if requested.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Display an official NHS QR code poster,</strong> so that customers and visitors can ‘check in’ using this option, as an alternative to providing their contact details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ensure you manage this information in line with data protection regulations.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your NGB’s guidance will set out the process you should follow to collect information, and you can find more detailed advice in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">guidance on NHS Test and Trace</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Organising sporting activities</h3>

<p><strong>When planning a sporting activity, you should ensure that:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>All participants and attendees (including players, officials, organisers, volunteers and spectators) are aware of COVID-19 symptoms and the need to self-assess before attending every sporting activity.</li>
  <li>Any participant or other attendee reporting symptoms does not attend and is directed to follow <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">NHS and PHE guidance on self-isolation</a>.</li>
  <li>Participants are aware of any increased risk associated with taking part in sporting activity, based on the national governing body’s guidance and risk assessment.</li>
  <li>Participants are strongly advised to comply with public health restrictions and avoid high-risk behaviour outside the sports setting to reduce the risk to their fellow participants when they do attend.</li>
  <li>Participants continue to adhere to legal gathering limits before and after sporting activities, act responsibly and limit transmission risk wherever possible.</li>
  <li>Participants are aware that they are choosing to take part in the modified version of the game, including any relevant COVID-19 measures, and should comply with these measures as a condition of participation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You should also ensure you are adhering to important safety measures:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>When spectators are allowed, you should ensure that spectators are following legal gathering limits and do not put the safety of participants at risk. Where it is anticipated that an activity will attract spectators, there should be a named person or persons with responsibility for ensuring adherence with these guidelines and ensuring the facility is COVID-secure. They should carry out and publish a risk assessment for the activity which limits the number of spectators and focuses on the need to maintain social distancing on arrival, for the duration of the activity, and on departure.</li>
  <li>Ensure you are collecting information from participants, spectators and other attendees, which is detailed enough to allow NHS Test and Trace to contact them if necessary (as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#test-and-trace">NHS Test and Trace section</a> above). Your NGB or organiser’s guidance should tell you what you need to do, or you can find more detailed advice in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>Ensure that all sessions comply with your NGB’s or organiser’s safeguarding policies and procedures, with particular consideration to children and young people, and vulnerable adults who may be less able to understand or maintain social distancing discipline.</li>
  <li>All clubs running activities for under-18s in out-of-school settings should consult the Department for Education’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">guidance on activity in out-of-school settings</a>, which sets out further practical steps providers of community activities, holiday clubs, after-school clubs, tuition and other out-of-school provision for children should follow to minimise the risk of transmission for children attending their settings.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sanctions for non-compliance</strong></p>

<p>Sporting activities are permitted despite wider restrictions because of the benefits of sport and physical activity for people’s physical and mental wellbeing. If people act irresponsibly when participating in sport (including off the pitch, and when socialising before and after activity), they jeopardize public health and undermine the case for safe sport to take place.</p>

<p>National governing bodies and organised sport providers should ensure that clubs, leagues and providers are running activities safely, and should take action to address any issues. This includes putting in place additional measures or suspending players, teams, leagues or clubs which do not adhere to guidance. <strong>If there are serious or consistent concerns with a particular sport which the NGB or organised sport provider cannot or does not address, approval may be revoked so that the sport cannot take place.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Off-field activity</strong></p>

<p>Sport providers should put in place measures to limit transmission risk from off-field activity, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Limiting the time spent congregating at a venue before and after sporting activity. This could involve having strict meeting times or staggering start times, and advising participants to arrive in kit and ready to warm-up.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that participants maintain social distancing throughout warm-ups and when not on the field of play (e.g. awaiting substitutions) and limit higher-risk activities like spitting or shouting (particularly when facing each other).</li>
  <li>Ensuring that participants adhere to legal gathering limits. Social interaction before and after playing any sport should only take place outdoors, in a group of up to 6 people, or as a group of two households. Exceptions may be made where safety and safeguarding measures require this, such as supporting participants with disabilities (though minimal time should be spent waiting or in changing rooms).</li>
  <li>Avoiding equipment-sharing where possible. For sport and activities involving shared equipment, organisers should limit the number of participants handling the same equipment during warm-ups, and ensure equipment is frequently sanitised. Teams should limit the number of players handling the same ball during warm-ups, and ensure the balls are frequently sanitised.</li>
  <li>Advising participants to bring their own water bottles and ensure they are labelled or highly distinguishable. <strong>Water bottles or other refreshment containers should not be shared under any circumstances.</strong>
</li>
  <li>Advising participants to take their kit home to wash it themselves, rather than have one person handling a large quantity of soiled materials. Where kit absolutely has to be shared or kept together (for example last minute stand-in players, shortage of kit, or an essential club function), each person handling it must wash or sanitise their hands immediately after.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>On-field activity</strong></p>

<p>All sport providers must follow their national governing body’s or organised sport provider’s guidance on how to participate safely in their sport or activity. This includes any modifications to game-play required (e.g. limits on numbers for indoor activity, reducing physical contact or face-to-face exposure). Providers should also put in place additional mitigations to reduce unnecessary contact, such as removing pre-game handshakes, face-to-face interaction, and scoring celebrations.</p>

<p>Providers should ensure that participants remain socially distanced during breaks in play with spaced areas for equipment and refreshment storage, including officials and substitutes. Coaching staff and substitutes, should, for example, be spread out and avoid sharing a dugout or bench if social distancing cannot be observed.</p>

<p><strong>Water bottles or other refreshment containers should not be shared under any circumstances.</strong> Participants are advised to bring their own, in a labelled or highly distinguishable container. Participants should be asked to refrain from spitting or rinsing out their mouths on or around the playing area.</p>

<p>Sharing of equipment must be avoided where possible, particularly that used around the head and face, such as helmets. Where equipment is shared, equipment must be cleaned before use by another person. Sports where a ball needs to be handled by multiple players (such as basketball, cricket, or football) must follow the measures put in place by their national governing body to reduce the transmission risk (for example, by pausing play to sanitise the ball at regular intervals).</p>

<p>Shouting and singing increase the risk of transmission, particularly in close proximity situations or when face-to-face. Coaches and substitutes should refrain from shouting, and those on the pitch should avoid it where possible.</p>

<p><strong>Use of facilities</strong></p>

<p>All facilities providers should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/providers-of-grassroots-sport-and-gym-leisure-facilities" class="govuk-link">guidance for sport facilities</a>. That sets out specific information on how to operate an indoor or outdoor facility safely (including changing rooms and toilets), and measures that should be taken to minimise risk (such as one-way systems, capacity limits and social distancing).</p>

<p><strong>Injuries and emergencies</strong></p>

<p>Injuries should still be treated, as participant safety is of the utmost importance. Physios and other medical personnel should take care to protect themselves and others through rigorous cleaning and personal hygiene, including increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting equipment and surfaces. Wearing face coverings is recommended for both medics and patients, where this is possible and practical.</p>

<p>After contact with an injured participant, physios and other medical personnel should clean their hands thoroughly with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser at the earliest opportunity. This advice is applicable to all situations, regardless of whether there was close contact or the minimum social distancing was maintained. They should also avoid touching their mouth, eyes and nose.</p>

<p>Physios and medical personnel should keep a record of each participant they have come into contact with, to support NHS Test and Trace (advice set out above in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#test-and-trace">section on NHS Test and Trace</a> may be helpful). Records should be kept for 21 days and then destroyed. Those working at a sport event should familiarise themselves with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov">guidance for first responders</a>, in case of emergency situations.</p>
