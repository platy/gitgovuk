<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/entry-requirements">entry requirements for The Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>You must carry photographic ID at all times. If you are in the Netherlands for more than 3 months, you must apply for your residence permit (verblijfsdocument). To do this, you must register with your local Municipality Administration (Gemeente) who can tell you what documents you will need.</p>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h3 id="residency-and-visas-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency and visas after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration">EU withdrawal agreement</a> sets out an implementation period until 31 December 2020, when you can live, work and travel in the Netherlands broadly as before the UK leaves the EU. You will be able to move to the Netherlands and establish residency under the same rules as before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Dutch government will implement a 15 month national transition scheme from the day the UK leaves the EU. If you are currently legally resident in the Netherlands, you and your non-EU family members will keep your rights to live, work, and study in the Netherlands. 
During the 15 month national transition period, the Dutch government will invite you and your family to apply for a national residence permit if you meet the same conditions that apply to EU citizens.</p>

<p>If you are registered in the Netherlands with the Gemeenteâ€™s Personal Records Database, the Dutch government will send you a temporary residence permit by post. 
If you have not registered with the Gemeenteâ€™s Personal Records database, you should follow these steps to register for a digital version of the temporary residence permit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Register yourself with the Personal Records Database of the municipality where you live.</li>
  <li>Get a <a rel="external" href="https://www.digid.nl/en/">DigiD</a> so you can submit an online application to the IND.</li>
  <li>Use your DigiD to log in to <a rel="external" href="https://mijn.overheid.nl/">MijnOverheid</a> and access your <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Message-Box.aspx">Berichtenbox</a>
</li>
  <li>Go to Settings (Instellingen) and under Landelijke Organisaties, tick the box for IND to make sure you can receive emails.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have done this, the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) will send you a digital temporary residence permit.</p>

<p>You may not receive a temporary residence permit if your residence right is not affected by the UK leaving the EU. You can look at the <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/">INDâ€™s guidance</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You should carry your temporary residence permit with you, along with photographic ID, at all times, as you may be asked for a copy.</p>

<p>For more information, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/entry-requirements">entry requirements for the Netherlands</a> or read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands">our travel advice</a>
</li>
  <li>read the Dutch governmentâ€™s <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Brexit.aspx">guidance on residency and EU Exit</a>
</li>
  <li>call the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) EU Exit information line with any questions about your right of residence, on +31 (0)88 04 30410, Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm (Dutch time)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you arrive in the Netherlands after the UK leaves the EU, you will be treated as a non-EU national.  Further information on this will be published on the website of the Ministry of IND in due course.</p>

<p>You should read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/documents/publications/2019/03/29/no-deal-brexit-impact-and-measures">summary of impacts of the UK leaving the EU for UK Nationals produced by the Dutch Government</a>.</p>

<h2 id="studying">Studying</h2>

<p>If you are in the Netherlands for study purposes only, your educational institution will apply for a residence permit on your behalf. The educational institution can only submit a residence permit application for you if they are recognised as a sponsor by the IND.</p>

<p>To obtain a residence permit for study, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be enrolled for a full-time day course at an educational institution that is recognised as a sponsor.</li>
  <li>have enough money for at least 1 yearâ€™s maintenance.</li>
  <li>be insured against medical expenses whilst you are in the Netherlands.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are under 30 and live in the Netherlands for study purposes only, you cannot enrol with a Dutch health insurer for the mandatory basic health insurance. See information below on what to do after the UK leaves the EU about health insurance.</p>

<p>If you have a part-time job during your studies, you become subject to Dutch social security legislation and are required to have mandatory basic health insurance with a Dutch health insurer. This is also the case if you have a zero hours contract, volunteer position or internship.</p>

<h3 id="studying-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Studying after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, you will be able to study in the Netherlands broadly as before. You will be able to use a UK issued EHIC card for 12 months.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then whilst studying in the Netherlands you will need to purchase private health insurance (which differs from the mandatory Dutch health insurance). However, if you get a job or volunteer position, you will become subject to Dutch social security provisions and must take out mandatory health insurance.</p>

<p>If you arrive in the Netherlands to study after the UK leaves the EU, you will be treated as a non-EU national and will need to have private health insurance. If you get a job, you will become subject to Dutch social security provisions and must take out mandatory health insurance.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be changes to student fees and loans.  Find more information on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/brexit/question-and-answer/how-will-brexit-affect-british-nationals-studying-in-the-netherlands">Dutch governmentâ€™s website</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about studying in the Netherlands, visit the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nuffic.nl/en/">Nuffic</a> website.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from the Netherlands</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or â€˜emergency passportâ€™</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be new travel rules.  If you visit the Netherlands or elsewhere in the Schengen area, the European Commission has said you <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6402_en.htm">may not need a visa for short stays (90 days in a 180 day period)</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in the Netherlands, you must carry your temporary residency permit with you at all times when travelling to and from the Netherlands. It is only valid in combination with a valid passport.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you move to the Netherlands, you must arrange <a rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/health-insurance">health insurance</a> within 4 months of your arrival. The basic Dutch health insurance (basis verzekering) covers general medical care, such as visits to a local GP, hospital and basic dental care. You can read guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.zorgverzekering.org/eng/">health insurance in the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>If you are already resident in the Netherlands you will normally be subject to Dutch social security legislation, and must already have the mandatory healthcare insurance.  For students see below.</p>

<p>If you are resident in the Netherlands, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in the Netherlands.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland.</li>
  <li>The EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home.</li>
  <li>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</li>
  <li>For more information you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>.</li>

<p>You can find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-netherlands-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">English speaking doctor in the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check that your prescriptions are legal</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in the Netherlands will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and you are resident in the Netherlands, there will be no change if you already purchase mandatory health insurance.  If you access healthcare through an S1 or S2 arrangement with the UK, your access to healthcare may change.</p>

<p>The UK has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with the Netherlands for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020.  If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and there is no arrangement with the Netherlands to continue reciprocal healthcare, pensioners receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>If you are a S1 form holder, you should take action now to confirm your residency status by contacting the IND and decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. UK nationals will be able to return to UK for treatment.</p>

<p>Your UK issued EHIC may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal, however this is reliant on the Netherlands continuing to accept UK EHICs.  If you have a Netherlands issued EHIC, you may continue to access healthcare outside of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>You should read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/">NHSâ€™s guidance on healthcare for UK nationals</a> and how it may change after UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h2 id="working">Working</h2>

<p>You should read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a></p>

<p>You may need to apply for a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>You may need a <a rel="external" href="https://www.justis.nl/producten/vog/certificate-of-conduct/">Certificate of Conduct (VOG) Netherlands</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves with a deal, your right to work will not change until the end of implementation Period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the temporary residence permit issued by the IND to legally resident UK nationals already in the Netherlands can only be used in combination with a valid passport. You must provide your employer with a copy of your temporary residence permit, together with a copy of your passport, to show that you are entitled to work in the Netherlands. This also applies to non-EU family members.</p>

<p>If you are planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-netherlands-providing-services-after-eu-exit">read our further guidance</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with the Netherlands to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>For more information, you can read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may also be able to pay <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">National Insurance while abroad</a> so that you protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK leaving the European Union will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in the Netherlands. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the Netherlands. Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/banking-insurance-and-other-financial-services-if-theres-no-brexit-deal-information-for-people-living-in-the-eea">using a bank card, insurance or other financial services in the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in the Netherlands, you can claim:</p>
