</ul>

<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/entry-requirements">entry requirements for the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>You must carry photographic ID at all times. If you are in the Netherlands for more than 3 months, you must apply for your residence permit (verblijfsdocument). To do this, you must register with your local Municipality Administration (Gemeente) who can tell you what documents you will need.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency rules or registration processes after Brexit, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h3 id="visas-and-residency-after-brexit">Visas and residency after Brexit</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. You  can live, work and travel in the Netherlands broadly as before Brexit. You will be able to move to the Netherlands and establish residency under the same rules as before Brexit.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, a national transition scheme will take effect up to and including 30 June 2020. Under this scheme, as a UK national, you keep your rights to live, work, and study in the Netherlands. This also applies if you are the family member of a UK national and you do not have another EU citizenship.</p>

<p>Before the date the UK exits the EU, the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> will send you a letter. This letter will be your temporary residence permit. If you would also like to receive the letter digitally, take the necessary steps to <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Brexit.aspx#what-to-do">receive post from the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> in your Message Box on MijnOverheid</a>. The <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> has already sent these permits to all UK nationals legally resident by 29 March 2019.</p>

<p>After the transition period you will need a new national residence permit. You can obtain a residence permit if you meet the same conditions for residence that apply to EU citizens, and have been invited to submit an application for this residence permit. This residence permit gives you the right to work and study in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>During the transition period you will receive an invitation from the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> to apply on-line for the national residence permit before 1 April 2020. These invitations will be sent in stages, as they would be in a deal situation.</p>

<p>If you already have a permanent EU residence document, the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> will invite you to apply for a permanent residence permit free of charge.</p>

<p>Your family members can be considered for a (temporary) residence permit (regardless of their nationality or main residence) if, as a UK national living in the Netherlands, you are in possession of a (temporary) residence permit. This is only possible during the transition period (in the event of a no-deal exit up to and including 30 June 2020). After this, the stricter national requirements for family reunification apply. These are explained on the <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/family">Family section of the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>If you are registered in the Netherlands with the Gemeente’s Personal Records Database, the Dutch government will send you a temporary residence permit by post.</p>

<p>If you have not registered with the Gemeente’s Personal Records database, follow these steps to register for a digital version of the temporary residence permit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register with the Personal Records Database of the municipality where you live, get a <a rel="external" href="https://www.digid.nl/en/">DigiD</a> so you can submit an online application to the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>
</li>
  <li>use your DigiD to log in to <a rel="external" href="https://mijn.overheid.nl/">MijnOverheid</a> and access your <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Message-Box.aspx">Berichtenbox</a>
</li>
  <li>go to Settings (Instellingen) and under Landelijke Organisaties, tick the box for <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> to make sure you can receive emails</li>
</ul>

<p>If your residency right is not affected by Brexit, you may not receive a temporary residency permit. You can look at the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>’s guidance for more information.</p>

<p>For more information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands/entry-requirements">entry requirements for the Netherlands</a> or read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/netherlands">our travel advice</a>
</li>
  <li>read the Dutch government’s <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Brexit.aspx">guidance on residency and Brexit</a>
</li>
  <li>call the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (<abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>) Brexit information line with any questions about your right of residence, on +31 (0) 88 04 30410, Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm (Dutch time)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you arrive in the Netherlands after Brexit, you will be treated as a non-EU national. Further information on this will be published on the Ministry of <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> website in due course.</p>

<p>Read the Dutch government’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/documents/publications/2019/03/29/no-deal-brexit-impact-and-measures">summary of impacts of Brexit for UK nationals</a>.</p>

<h2 id="studying">Studying</h2>

<p>If you are in the Netherlands for study purposes only, your educational institution will apply for a residence permit on your behalf. The educational institution can only submit a residence permit application for you if they are recognised as a sponsor by the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr>.</p>

<p>To obtain a residence permit for study, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be enrolled for a full-time day course at an educational institution that is recognised as a sponsor</li>
  <li>have enough money for at least 1 year’s maintenance</li>
  <li>be insured against medical expenses whilst you are in the Netherlands</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are under 30 and live in the Netherlands for study purposes only, you cannot enrol with a Dutch health insurer for the mandatory basic health insurance. See ‘Studying after Brexit’ on what to do after Brexit about health insurance.</p>

<p>If you have a part-time job during your studies, you become subject to Dutch social security legislation and are required to have mandatory basic health insurance with a Dutch health insurer. This is also the case if you have a zero hours contract, volunteer position or internship.</p>

<h3 id="studying-after-brexit">Studying after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, you will be able to study in the Netherlands broadly as before. You will be able to use a UK issued EHIC card.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, then whilst studying in the Netherlands you will need to purchase private health insurance (which differs from the mandatory Dutch health insurance). However, if you get a job or volunteer position, you will become subject to Dutch social security provisions and must take out mandatory health insurance.</p>

<p>If you arrive in the Netherlands to study after Brexit, you will be treated as a non-EU national and will need to purchase private health insurance. If you get a job, you will become subject to Dutch social security provisions and must take out mandatory Dutch health insurance.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, there may be changes to student fees and loans. Find more information from the Dutch government on <a rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/brexit/question-and-answer/how-will-brexit-affect-british-nationals-studying-in-the-netherlands">studying in the Netherlands after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit, the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form part of the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, you should have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland).  If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU</a>. You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180 day period. You must retain evidence of travel (such as train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<p>If you are resident in the Netherlands, you must carry your temporary residency permit with you at all times when travelling to and from the Netherlands. It is only valid in combination with a valid passport.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you move to the Netherlands, you must arrange <a rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/health-insurance">health insurance</a> within 4 months of your arrival. The basic Dutch health insurance (basis verzekering) covers general medical care, such as visits to a local GP, hospital and basic dental care. You can read guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.zorgverzekering.org/eng/">health insurance in the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in the Netherlands, you must not use a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>When you travel from the Netherlands for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>

</ul>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If you are a resident and purchase mandatory health insurance, your rights will remain the same, whether or not there is a deal.</p>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in the Netherlands will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, and you access healthcare through an S1 or S2 arrangement with the UK, your access to healthcare may change.</p>

<p>If you are a S1 form holder, you should take action now to confirm your residency status by contacting the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> to decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if there’s no deal.</p>

<p>If you currently have your healthcare costs paid for by the UK government, we can help if you are asked to pay for treatment during the first 6 months after Brexit. To organise a payment, you must give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>The UK has offered to continue paying the country you live in for your healthcare in the event of no deal, just as it does now. The government has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with the Netherlands for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If there’s no deal and there is no arrangement with the Netherlands to continue reciprocal healthcare, UK nationals receiving healthcare through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>Your UK-issued EHIC may not be valid if there’s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme, however this relies on the Netherlands continuing to accept UK EHICs. If you have a Netherlands issued EHIC, you may continue to access healthcare outside of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>You should read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/">NHS guidance on healthcare for UK nationals</a> and how it may change after Brexit.</p>

<h2 id="working">Working</h2>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a></p>

<p>You may need to apply for a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>You may need a <a rel="external" href="https://www.justis.nl/producten/vog/certificate-of-conduct/">Certificate of Conduct (VOG) Netherlands</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-after-brexit">Working after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your right to work will not change until the end of implementation period.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, the temporary residence permit issued by the <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> to legally resident UK nationals already in the Netherlands can only be used in combination with a valid passport. You must provide your employer with a copy of your temporary residence permit, together with a copy of your passport, to show that you are entitled to work in the Netherlands. This also applies to non-EU family members.</p>

<p>If you are planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after Brexit, you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-netherlands-providing-services-after-eu-exit">read our guidance on providing services after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with the Netherlands to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may also be able to pay <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">National Insurance while abroad</a> so that you protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<p>If the end date on your form is after 31 October 2019, you should contact the relevant EU, EEA or Swiss authority to confirm whether you need to start paying social security contributions in that country after 31 October, as well as UK National Insurance contributions.</p>

<p>Brexit will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in the Netherlands. Send your questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the Netherlands.
