<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU and provides for a deal on citizensâ€™ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the EU broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in the Netherlands at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information.</p>

<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>

<p>If you are lawfully resident in the Netherlands on or before 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay. You will need to submit your application for residency by 30 June 2021, in line with the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h3 id="citizen-service-number-bsn">Citizen service number (BSN)</h3>

<p>Everyone living in the Netherlands must have a citizen service number, often referred to as a BSN (burgerservicenummer). You must register with your local municipality (gemeente) and you will be assigned a citizen service number (BSN).</p>

<p>You must apply for a BSN within 5 days of arriving in the Netherlands. You will need to make an appointment with the municipality (gemeente) in which you live. Information on how to book an appointments and what documentation you will need will be on your local gemeenteâ€™s website.</p>

<p>A BSN is required for a variety of administrative procedures in the Netherlands. You will need one in order to work, open a bank account, arrange health insurance, visit a doctor or hospital, or apply for benefits.</p>

<p>If you leave the Netherlands and later return, youâ€™ll keep the same BSN when you re-register with the municipality.</p>

<p>Read the Dutch government <a rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/citizen-service-number-bsn" class="govuk-link">guidance about BSN numbers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="registering-in-the-personal-records-database">Registering in the Personal Records Database</h3>

<p>Every resident of the Netherlands must be registered in the Personal Records Database, referred to as the BRP  (Basisregistratie Personen) which is held by the local municipality Administration (gemeente). You may request to do this at the same time as you apply for your BSN.</p>

<p>If you move house, you should make sure you re-register again at your new address. The <abbr title="Immigration and Naturalisation Service">IND</abbr> and other government bodies will use the BRP to contact you, if they need to.</p>

<h3 id="the-new-residency-document">The new residency document</h3>

<p>You do not need to be invited to apply for the new residency document.</p>

<p>If you have been living in the Netherlands:</p>

<h2 id="studying">Studying</h2>

<p>If you are living in the Netherlands on or before 31 December 2020, you will still be entitled to receive student finance and pay statutory tuition fees as long as you meet the <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Pages/Brexit.aspx?fbclid=IwAR0LLjcivDH-K2YESM5okzG9DdhxbHEbZ_Et_JHLW5pmkMJGd99dZnz5n1I" class="govuk-link">residency conditions</a>.</p>

<p>Due to coronavirus, some Higher Education providers may be offering their courses online only. You should contact your educational institution for guidance on how this may affect you.</p>

<p>To study in the Netherlands, you need to obtain a residence permit. To do so you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be enrolled for a full-time day course at an <a rel="external" href="https://ind.nl/en/Documents/Public_Register_Educational_institutions.pdf" class="govuk-link">educational institution that is recognised as a sponsor</a>
</li>
  <li>have enough money for at least 1 yearâ€™s maintenance</li>
  <li>be insured against medical expenses whilst you are in the Netherlands</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are under 30 and live in the Netherlands for study purposes only, you cannot enrol with a Dutch health insurer for the mandatory basic health insurance. Read the NHS guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/" class="govuk-link">healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a part-time job during your studies, you become subject to Dutch social security legislation and are required to have mandatory basic health insurance with a Dutch health insurer. This includes if you have a zero hours contract, volunteer position or internship.</p>

<p>If you are coming to study in the Netherlands after 31 December 2020, you should contact your Higher Education provider so that you can check what fees you may have to pay.</p>

<p>We will update this guidance when more information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to the Netherlands, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to other Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the UK and Ireland will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you move to the Netherlands, you must arrange <a rel="external" href="https://www.government.nl/topics/health-insurance" class="govuk-link">health insurance</a> within 4 months of your arrival. The basic Dutch health insurance (basis verzekering) covers general medical care, such as visits to a local GP and hospital care. You can read guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.zorgverzekering.org/eng/" class="govuk-link">health insurance in the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a resident and purchase basic Dutch health insurance, your access to healthcare will not change.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-netherlands" class="govuk-link">guidance on who can access healthcare in the Netherlands and how to register</a>.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in the Netherlands and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-the-netherlands#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in the Netherlands, you must not use your EHIC from the UK to access healthcare in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>When you travel from the Netherlands for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<ul>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>There will be no changes before 31 December 2020 to the rules on claiming the UK State Pension in the EU, EEA or Switzerland as a result of the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020 you will get your UK State Pension uprated every year for as long as you continue to live there. This will happen even if you start claiming your pension on or after 1 January 2021, as long as you meet the qualifying conditions explained in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">new State Pension guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you are living in the Netherlands before by 31 December 2020, you will be able to count future social security contributions towards meeting the qualifying conditions for your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in the Netherlands, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Dutch pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are considering moving to the Netherlands on or after 1 January 2021 and you are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, the rules depend on negotiations with the EU and may change.
