<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Norway.</p>

</div>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This information is about living in Norway. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Norway</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you started living in Norway before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare in Norway will stay the same for as long as you remain resident.</p>

<p>This guidance explains what you need to do in Norway depending on your circumstances.</p>

<p>Anyone registered as a resident in Norway has a right to access the Norwegian state healthcare system.</p>

<p>State healthcare in Norway is not completely free. Healthcare costs are covered by both the state and through patient contributions (user fees).</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Norwegian healthcare system (called <a href="https://www.helsenorge.no/en/information-in-english/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Helfo</a>) in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registering a UK-issued S1 form with the National Insurance Scheme (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Norway’ below)</li>
  <li>making contributions to the National Insurance Scheme through their employer or as a self-employed person</li>
  <li>using a UK passport for temporary stays</li>
  <li>taking out private health insurance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Norway</h2>

<p>If you are planning on moving to Norway, see the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-norway">Living in Norway</a> for more information about visa and residency requirements.</p>

<p>You must register as a resident if you’re living in Norway for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>Once you’re a resident, you’re entitled to state healthcare on the same basis as a Norwegian citizen.</p>

<p>If you’re employed or self-employed, you’ll make contributions to the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nav.no/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme">National Insurance Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’re a resident you may also be entitled to a Norwegian European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) for travel.</p>

<h3>If you were living Norway before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you started living in Norway before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare in Norway will stay the same for as long as you remain resident.</p>

<p>This means you may also be entitled to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Norwegian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK</li>
  <li>a UK S1 if you start drawing a UK State Pension (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Norway’ below)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to register for healthcare</h3>

<p>You first need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-norway">register as a resident</a> in Norway. You’ll receive a Norwegian ID number. This is the same number you’ll use for healthcare access.</p>

<p>If you’re employed, your employer will sign you up to the National Insurance Scheme automatically. You’ll make contributions through your payroll.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, you first need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.brreg.no/" rel="external">register your business on the national register</a> (website in Norwegian). You can then sign up to the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nav.no/en/home/rules-and-regulations/membership-of-the-national-insurance-scheme">National Insurance Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve joined you’ll be able to access healthcare services through the Norwegian state healthcare system, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.helsenorge.no/en/foreigners-in-norway">Helfo</a>.</p>

<p>Give your Norwegian ID number when you register with a GP and each time you have an appointment.</p>

<p>To be referred to a specialist you need to see your GP first.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>State healthcare in Norway is not completely free. You may have to pay some of the cost of any treatment.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.helsenorge.no/en/payment-for-health-services/" rel="external">Find out how much you’ll need to pay for health services</a></p>

<p>If you’re a hospital inpatient, treatment is free. There are charges for outpatient treatment.</p>

<p>If you have an occupational health injury, Helfo may cover the full cost of your treatment.</p>

<p>Dentists and dental hygienist fees will vary as they can set their own prices.</p>

<p>Once you’ve spent a certain amount on state healthcare in a calendar year, you can get an <a href="https://www.helsenorge.no/foreigners-in-norway/exemption-card-for-public-health-services" rel="external" class="govuk-link">exemption card (‘frikort’)</a>.</p>

<p>Your exemption card means the National Insurance Scheme will cover most of your user fees for the rest of the calendar year.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Norway temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a detached worker, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) country.</p>

<p>You can use your UK passport or registered S1 form to access healthcare in Norway on the same basis as a Norwegian citizen.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Norway</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance if you have an S1 as a posted worker (see ‘If your UK employer has sent you to Norway temporarily (‘posted workers’)’ above).</p>

<p>If you started living in Norway before 1 January 2021, you may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-norway">Norwegian resident</a> and receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Norwegian system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Norway on the same basis as a Norwegian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/">planned treatments</a> in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Norway than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>

<p>If you have a UK State Pension or another qualifying exportable benefit, and you started living in Norway prior to 1 January 2021, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services (see contact details above).</p>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Norway</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 with the Norwegian state healthcare service Helfo. Send your S1 form to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Helfo
<br>Postboks 2415
<br>3104 Tønsberg
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Give your Norwegian ID number each time you access healthcare. This will prove that you’re an S1 holder and are entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Norwegian citizen.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>If you are experiencing delays registering your S1 with local authorities and require emergency or urgent treatment, contact the Overseas Healthcare Services on 0044 191 218 1999.</p>
</div>

<h2>Studying in Norway</h2>

<p>You can use your UK passport to access healthcare in Norway on the same basis as a Norwegian citizen.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Because the NHS is a residency-based system, under NHS rules UK nationals who move abroad on a permanent basis may lose their entitlement to free NHS healthcare.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national and move to the EU, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK unless you have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, PRC or S2 to show your healthcare costs are funded by the EU country in which you now live, or another exemption applies.</p>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK war pensioners</li>
  <li>UK government employees</li>
  <li>UK nationals living in the EU on or before 31 December 2020, once they have a registered, UK-issued S1</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about using the NHS when you no longer live in the UK (see ‘UK nationals who no longer live in the UK’ in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-eu-and-efta-citizens-visiting-the-uk">Healthcare for visitors to the UK from the EU</a>).</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
