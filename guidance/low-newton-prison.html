</div>

<p>New prisoners are allowed one unbooked ‘reception visit’ in their first 7 days at Low Newton. Family or friends need to come to the Prison Visitors centre at one of the set visiting times and state that they are there for a “reception visit’.</p>

<p>All other visits to Low Newton must be booked 48 hours in advance.</p>

<p>Unconvicted prisoners can have up to 3 visits Monday to Friday and 1 visit on a weekend.</p>

<p>Women who have been convicted can have at least 2 visits each month. This is reviewed each month so they might be able to get more visits.</p>

<p>To book a visit to someone you must be on their visitor list and have <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-low-newton">the required ID</a>. Prisoners must submit a visitor request form to security to add people to their list. This must include date of birth for all visitors.</p>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit.</p>

<p>All visitors are required to arrive at the visitors centre between 1pm and 1:30pm as it can take time for ID to be checked. Any late arrivals may be refused entry. Temperature checking will be in place and entry refused for symptomatic persons. Visitors must bring and wear a face covering from arrival at the visitors centre and throughout the entire visit and must not be removed until you have left the establishment (excludes children under 11 years old).</p>

<p>Contact with prisoners for adults is permitted on production of a negative COVID test on arrival. Proof will need to be shown. Children under the age of 11 do not need to provide test evidence.</p>

<p>Not wearing a mask will only be considered with a relevant medical document. Refreshments will not be on sale or provided in the visitors centre or visits room.
