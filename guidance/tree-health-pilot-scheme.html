<p>The tree health pilot scheme will test different ways of slowing the spread of pests and diseases affecting trees in England.</p>

<p>It expands on support already available through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship-woodland-tree-health-grant-manual-from-9-february-2021">Countryside Stewardship woodland tree health grant</a>.</p>

<p>The results of the pilot, which runs from August 2021 to 2024, will help develop the future funding policy for tree health schemes.</p>

<p>Around 100 grant agreements will be allocated through a competitive application process.</p>

<h2>Who can take part</h2>

<p>The tree health pilot scheme is for people in certain regions of England who manage specific trees or woodlands infected by specific pests and diseases.</p>

<p>You can apply as an individual or on behalf of other people for a group grant (for example, if you’re from a local council, a charity or you’re a land agent).</p>

<p>You’ll usually be invited to take part in the pilot because you’ve been contacted by a Forestry Commission woodland officer. This will be because you have a specific tree, pest or disease on your land. For example, you might have been given a Statutory Plant Health Notice (<abbr title="Statutory Plant Health Notice">SPHN</abbr>) for trees infected by one of the specified pests or diseases.</p>

<p>If you’ve not been contacted by a Forestry Commission woodland officer and you read this guidance and think you’re eligible, you can express your interest to take part in the scheme.</p>

<p>If you are applying as an individual to take part in the tree health pilot scheme, you must be a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>landowner</li>
  <li>occupier</li>
  <li>tenant</li>
  <li>landlord</li>
  <li>licensor</li>
</ul>

<p>To take part in the pilot scheme, the trees or woodlands you, or your group (if relevant), manage must have one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>oak with oak processionary moth (<abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr>) in the Established Area (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1045822/ManagementZones_Approved2022__002_.pdf" rel="external">map of the Established Area</a>) within London and the South East)</li>
  <li>ash with ash dieback</li>
  <li>larch with Phytophthora ramorum</li>
  <li>spruce growing in the high-risk spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) area (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040999/DemarcatedArea_Ips_Dec_2021.pdf" rel="external">map of demarcated area</a>)</li>
  <li>sweet chestnut with Phytophthora ramorum or sweet chestnut blight</li>
</ul>

<p>The trees or woodlands you manage must be based in one of the following regions of England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>North West</li>
  <li>West Midlands</li>
  <li>South East and London</li>
</ul>

<p>Priority may be given to applications within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) demarcated area</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr> established area</li>
  <li>specific areas of outstanding natural beauty (Arnside and Silverdale, Malvern hills, Shropshire hills, and all of the Lake District National Park)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re not sure which region your trees or woodlands are located in, check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission/about/access-and-opening#area-offices">Area and Woodland Officer boundaries map</a>.</p>

<h3>If you already get other funding</h3>

<p>If you already get funding from other agri-environment or woodland schemes, you can still take part in the tree health pilot scheme. The activities for the pilot must be different to the activities you’re already getting funding for. You cannot get paid twice for the same work or activities.</p>

<p>Do not spend money on any pilot activities before you have signed a grant agreement. If you do the work before the agreement is signed, you will lose the opportunity to get a grant.</p>

<h2>Grants for trees in and outside of woodlands</h2>

<p>If you join the tree health pilot scheme, you’ll get a grant to help pay back some of the costs of carrying out work, for example, to remove and replace diseased trees. The scheme covers trees both in woodlands and outside of woodlands, depending on the grant you apply for.</p>

<p>The Forestry Commission may change, add or remove tree types or pests and diseases, grants or rates of payment, throughout the duration of the pilot. Your grant agreement will not be affected by changes the Forestry Commission makes to the pilot after you’ve signed it.</p>

<h3>Grant requirements for trees in woodland</h3>

<p>If you’re applying for trees in a woodland, the group of trees you’re applying for must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cover at least 0.5 hectares</li>
  <li>be at least 5 metres high, or will grow to this height</li>
  <li>have a crown cover of more than 20% of the ground area</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grant requirements for trees outside woodland</h3>

<p>Trees outside of woodlands are any trees or small woods which cover an area of less than 0.5 hectares. For example, trees in hedgerows, along a road or in parks.</p>

<h3>Grant funding</h3>

<p>Your grant application must have a minimum funding value of £500. Use the payment tables under each tree type to work out how much you want to apply for.</p>

<p>Some grants cover up to a percentage of ‘actual costs’ and others are based on ‘standard costs’. The payment tables will show you whether it’s one or the other.</p>

<p>Actual costs means the total amount it costs for you to carry out the work or buy goods and services.</p>

<p>Standard costs means a fixed rate which has been worked out based on the average market prices for buying or doing something.</p>

<h2>Group grants for oak trees affected by oak processionary moth (<abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr>)</h2>

<p>This grant supports a facilitator bringing together a group of people, to better understand the risks and hazards of oak processionary moth on their trees in the Established Area (see the map of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1045822/ManagementZones_Approved2022__002_.pdf" rel="external">Established Area</a> within London and the South East).</p>

<p>The facilitator will get financial support and advice to create a group <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr> management plan. The plan will set out site-specific actions for individual group members and also area-based actions for the whole group.</p>

<p>If you would like to request a copy of the <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr> management plan, email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk">thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Groups will also be supported by the Forestry Commission-run <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr> workshops. Group members can learn from specialists and ask questions about how to manage oak trees with <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr> and the risks they pose.</p>

<p>To apply for this grant you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be part of a group</li>
  <li>make one group application</li>
  <li>have oak trees in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1045822/ManagementZones_Approved2022__002_.pdf" rel="external">Established Area</a> that may be affected by <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for a grant to pay back the costs of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your time spent acting as a facilitator for the group (for example, forming the group, creating the group’s <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr> management plan, organising tree surveying)</li>
  <li>hiring contractors to survey the group’s oak trees to identify <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grants for ash with ash dieback</h2>

<p>You can only apply for these grants as part of a group application. Grants apply to roadside ash with ash dieback in and outside of woodlands.</p>

<p>There are no grants for felling ash with ash dieback. There are grants available to help with other costs associated with felling roadside ash, such as road closure costs.</p>

<p>If you need to fell ash trees, you’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-felling-licence-when-you-need-to-apply">get a felling licence</a>, unless the Forestry Commission confirms the ash trees are dangerous and exempt. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-ash-trees-affected-by-ash-dieback-operations-note-46a">Read about managing ash trees affected by ash dieback</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to improve access to trees as you carry out work, you can apply for a road closure grant to pay for road closure costs. You’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">contact your local council</a> to find out how road closures work and how much they cost in your area.</p>

<h3>Funding for ash trees in and outside of woodlands</h3>

<p>You can apply for grants to pay back the costs of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a European protected species site survey to plan how to fell and restock without causing harm or disturbing protected species (if you cannot avoid disturbing protected species, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-protected-species-apply-for-a-mitigation-licence">you’ll need a licence from Natural England</a>)</li>
  <li>road closures while you fell your infected ash trees</li>
  <li>a facilitator’s time to manage a group application</li>
  <li>restocking and capital items to replace the trees with different tree species that are more likely to withstand pests, diseases and climate change, including items to protect them (for example, fencing and netting)</li>
  <li>maintenance, if you’ve applied for a restocking grant (this is paid at the end of your agreement year for 3 years, to help establish new trees)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grants for larch with Phytophthora ramorum</h2>

<p>You can apply as an individual or as a group for grants for larch trees with Phytophthora ramorum in woodlands (more than 0.5ha).</p>

<p>If you own a group of larch trees (less than 0.5ha) infected with Phytophthora ramorum, you can apply as part of a group application. The total area of the larch trees in the group must be 0.5ha or larger.</p>

<p>Grants for individuals will pay back the costs of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>infrastructure and access aids to improve access to your woodlands - for example, a temporary road surface so you can remove felled trees</li>
  <li>felling, for infected larch trees where you cannot sell the timber or recover your costs from selling it (you can only apply for this either with an infrastructure and access aids grant or if your trees are over the age of 25, or both)</li>
  <li>chemically killing the infected larch trees, if advised by the Forestry Commission</li>
  <li>biosecurity items, to prevent the spread of pests and diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot get a restocking or capital items grant as part of an individual application for larch trees with Phytophthora ramorum in this pilot. You can apply for these grants through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-tree-health-grant-countryside-stewardship">Countryside Stewardship woodland tree health grant</a>.</p>

<h2>Apply for the scheme</h2>

<p>You can apply on your own, or as a group, depending on the situation. For example, if you and your neighbours have the same tree species with the same pest or disease, you might want to apply together. Some grants only allow group applications.</p>

<p>Group applications must have a person, called a facilitator, who’ll have overall responsibility for the application and the work. The facilitator could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone from your group you nominate</li>
  <li>a private agent</li>
  <li>an organisation, such as a local council, woodland initiative or wildlife trust</li>
</ul>

<p>The facilitator will be responsible for making sure everyone does the work they’ve agreed to do and providing any evidence needed to the Forestry Commission.</p>

<p>Group grants will include an hourly fee (£20 per hour) for the facilitator. This will pay towards their work organising and coordinating the group work.</p>

<p>The facilitator cannot claim more in facilitation fees than the total value of grants the group applies for. This applies to all grants except <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr> grants. For <abbr title="oak processionary moth">OPM</abbr> grants, the facilitator cannot claim for more than 170 hours of work each month.</p>

<p>For more information about a group facilitator’s role and responsibilities under the tree health pilot scheme,  email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk">thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>Expression of interest form</h3>

<p>If you want to take part in the tree health pilot scheme and think you’re eligible, you first need to fill in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tree-health-pilot-scheme-expression-of-interest-form">expression of interest form</a></p>

<p>This includes an option to show whether you want to apply as an individual or as part of a group.</p>

<h3>Initial assessment and site visit</h3>

<p>A Forestry Commission representative will contact you usually within 3 weeks of receiving your expression of interest form. They will discuss your circumstances with you, for example if you have the right kind of trees, to assess if you are eligible for the pilot.</p>

<p>If it looks like you are eligible, a woodland officer will then visit your site to assess your trees or woodlands.</p>

<p>During a visit, If they find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/pests-and-diseases/pest-and-disease-factsheets/" rel="external">notifiable pest or disease</a> in your trees, you might be issued with an <abbr title="Statutory Plant Health Notice">SPHN</abbr>, if you do not already have one. If you’re issued with an <abbr title="Statutory Plant Health Notice">SPHN</abbr>, you’re legally required to deal with the pest or disease problem you have, even if you do not receive funding as part of this pilot.</p>

<p>Based on the initial assessment and site visit, the Forestry Commission will advise you whether or not you should submit a full application.</p>

<p>The tree health pilot scheme is competitive. Applications will be scored based partly on how they will contribute to research and learning within the tree health pilot scheme.</p>

<p>If you’re not eligible to take part in the tree health pilot scheme, you may be able to apply for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-tree-health-grant-countryside-stewardship">Countryside Stewardship woodland tree health grant</a> instead.</p>

<p>If you want to make a full application for the tree health pilot, after your initial assessment and site visit, you can request an application form to fill in. To request a form, or for more information about how to apply, email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk">thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>On the form, you will be asked for more detailed information about the trees and grants you want to apply for.</p>

<p>You’ll need to gather evidence to complete this application, for example, detailed maps and quotes.</p>

<p>If you haven’t already, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-payments-service-registering-and-updating-your-details">register with the Rural Payments Agency to get a single business identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>)</a>. You will need to include your <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> on your form.</p>

<p>You do not need to register land you include in the tree health pilot on the Rural Land Register.</p>

<p>You can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Technical-guidance">technical guidance</a> to help you understand what you need to do for activities such as restocking, felling or improving biosecurity.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake on your application form, you’ll be asked to make corrections and resubmit your form.</p>

<p>Email your completed application form and supporting documents to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk">thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a></p>

<h3>After you’ve submitted your full application</h3>

<p>The Forestry Commission will contact you within 2 to 6 weeks of receiving your completed application form. This is to tell you whether your application was successful and the amount of funding you can claim.</p>

<p>You can make a complaint or appeal against a Forestry Commission decision. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission/about/complaints-procedure">Find out how to make a complaint or appeal.</a></p>

<p>If your application is successful, the Forestry Commission will send you an agreement offer and enclose a declaration. You must sign and return the grant offer and terms and conditions by email or post by the date requested, to accept the grant offer.</p>

<h3>After you have signed your agreement</h3>

<p>You’ll need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete ‘Threats to your Woodlands’ training, which is a set of 3 short online webinars about biosecurity, tree health and mammal damages to trees and woodlands.</li>
  <li>Fill in a biosecurity management plan, which is a form that explains what you’ll need to do to reduce the risk of spreading pests and diseases on the land you’re applying for.</li>
  <li>Complete the works you’ve got the funding for, for example, to buy the goods, hire a contractor or do the work yourself.</li>
  <li>Keep detailed records and submit evidence that you’ve completed the work, for example receipts and photos (evidence might also be gathered from a visit by a woodland officer).</li>
  <li>Email a THP claim form to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk">thpilotenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Participant feedback</h3>

<p>As a tree health pilot scheme participant, you’ll be asked to provide feedback for the duration of your agreement.</p>

<p>We will ask you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fill out surveys</li>
  <li>attend online workshops with other participants, if needed</li>
  <li>have one-on-one conversations with researchers</li>
