<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Greece before 1 January 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should check that you are correctly registered and should get a new residence document by 30 June 2021 to evidence your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">guidance on living in Europe.</a></p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>All UK nationals resident in Greece before 1 January 2021 should get the new biometric residence document. The deadline for getting the new document is 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>This deadline is indicative which means that your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement will not be affected if you do not meet the deadline. However, we recommend that you get it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Read <a rel="external" href="http://www.astynomia.gr/images/stories/2020/files20/24102020-kya.pdf" class="govuk-link">the Greek Ministerial Decision on residence documents (in Greek)</a> and <a href="http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=98268&amp;Itemid=133&amp;lang=EN" rel="external" class="govuk-link">the related announcement from the Hellenic Police</a> (including a series of Q&amp;As).</p>

<p>If you have been legally resident in Greece for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>over 5 years: you will be eligible for permanent residency and a 10-year renewable residency document</li>
  <li>less than 5 years: you will be eligible for a document with 5 years validity</li>
</ul>

<p>To request the document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you live in Attica and Thessaloniki regions, visit your nearest Hellenic Police station that has an Aliens Department</li>
  <li>if you live elsewhere, visit your nearest General Regional Police Directorate that has an Aliens Department</li>
  <li>non-EU family members should visit their nearest Directorate for Aliens and Migration of the Decentralized Administrations</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also read <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://brexit.gov.gr/uk-citizens-in-greece/">the Greek governmentâ€™s website for UK nationals living in Greece</a> and submit any questions in the <a href="https://brexit.gov.gr/contact/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">contact form</a> provided.</p>

<h3>Additional support</h3>

<p>UK nationals who are resident in Greece, and need help to complete their residence application or registration, can get support from organisations funded by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-allocates-3-million-to-support-uk-nationals-in-the-eu">UK Nationals Support Fund</a>.</p>

<p>This support is only available to people who need additional help to secure their rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. They may include pensioners, disabled people, people living in remote areas or people who have mobility difficulties. Support available includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>answering questions about residence applications, such as the documents you need and how the application process works</li>
  <li>guiding you through the process, if necessary</li>
  <li>support if you experience language barriers or difficulty accessing online information and services</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to Greece</h3>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/greece/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Greece</a>.</p>

<p>You should also read:</p>

<ul>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence document (registration certificate or permanent residence certificate), as well as your valid passport when you travel.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Greece. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Greece, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a>, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Greece.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Greece.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Greece, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register for healthcare as a resident in Greece, as well as registering, where necessary, with a health insurer.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-greece" class="govuk-link">guidance on who can access healthcare in Greece</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Greece temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-greece#posted-worker">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Greece before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Greece and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-greece#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on using an S1 form in Greece</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Greece, you must not use a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for healthcare in Greece.</p>

<p>If you were living in Greece before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Greece</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" rel="external">Apply now for a new UK <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</a></p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h3>Prescriptions</h3>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Greece.</p>

<p>The Greek government has introduced a platform for ordering prescriptions online, read a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/883561/eprescriptions_April2020.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">step by step guide</a> on how to access the service (some information in Greek). This platform is only accessible within Greece.</p>

<h2>Working in Greece</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Greece before 1 January 2021, you will have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in an EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link">UK criminal records check</a>
</li>
  <li>a Greek criminal records check, via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_criminal_records-95-el-en.do?member=1" rel="external">Penal Records Department</a> of the Ministry of Justice or your local <a href="http://www.kep.gov.gr/portal/page/portal/kep" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Citizens Service Centre (<abbr title="Citizens Service Centre">KEP</abbr>)</a> (in Greek)</li>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Greece and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country, before January 2021 you may need a permit to show you are a frontier worker. You should also get the new biometric residence permit.</p>

<p>We will update this guidance when more information is available.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Greece to prevent income being taxed in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Greece have not changed following the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on:</p>

Once you have an AFM number, it is compulsory to submit a yearly tax return.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Greece. Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greece-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">an English-speaking lawyer in Greece</a>.</p>

<h3>Banking</h3>

<p>Whether UK banks can provide services to customers living in the EEA is a matter of local law and regulation. Your bank or finance provider should contact you if they need to make any changes to your product or the way they provide it. If you have any concerns about whether you might be affected, contact your provider or seek independent financial advice.</p>
