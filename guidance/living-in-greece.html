<h2>If you were living in Greece before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Greece since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizens’ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Greek government and your local authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/greece">Greece travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Greece, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/greece/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/greece/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Greece</a>.</p>

<p>You should also read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mfa.gr/uk/en/visa.html?mission=lon" rel="external">Greek Embassy in London’s guidance on national visas</a>
</li>
  <li>the Greek government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.enterprisegreece.gov.gr/en/greece-today/living-in-greece/residence-permits" rel="external">guidance on residence permits for real estate owners in Greece</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Greece before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you have lived in Greece since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have rights under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>All UK nationals resident in Greece before 1 January 2021 should get the new biometric residence document (Engrafo Diamonis 18 (4) ΣΑ Έγγραφο Διαμονής). It shows that you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. The Greek government has not yet set a deadline for getting the document, but confirmed that it will be indicative. This means that your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement will not be affected if you do not meet the deadline. However, we strongly recommend that you request the Engrafo Diamonis 18 (4). It also shows your right to enter Greece and exempts you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.astynomia.gr/images/stories/2020/files20/24102020-kya.pdf" rel="external">the Greek Ministerial Decision on residence documents</a> (in Greek) and the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=98268&amp;Itemid=133&amp;lang=EN" rel="external">related announcement from the Hellenic Police</a> (including a series of Q&amp;As).</p>

<p>To request the document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you live in Attica and Thessaloniki regions, visit your nearest Hellenic Police station that has an Aliens Department</li>
  <li>if you live elsewhere, visit your nearest General Regional Police Directorate that has an Aliens Department</li>
  <li>non-EU family members should visit their nearest Directorate for Aliens and Migration of the Decentralized Administrations</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have been legally resident in Greece for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>over 5 years: you will be eligible for permanent residency and a 10-year residence document which you should renew when it expires</li>
  <li>less than 5 years: you will be eligible for a document valid for 5 years. After 5 years, when you renew it, you will get a 10-year residence document.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=98919&amp;Itemid=133&amp;lang=EN" rel="external">Hellenic police’s guidance on how to renew your residence document</a>.</p>

<p>The Greek authorities will only accept your application if you include all the documents that they request. When your application is accepted, you will be given a temporary certificate. You can use this until you receive your biometric residence document.</p>

<p>You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://brexit.gov.gr/uk-citizens-in-greece/" rel="external">Greek government’s website for UK nationals living in Greece</a> and submit any questions using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://brexit.gov.gr/contact/" rel="external">contact form</a>.</p>

<p>If your mobility is impaired, for example you are bedridden, hospitalised, in a nursing home or care facility, you do not need to request the biometric residence document in person. You can authorise a family member or lawyer to apply on your behalf. You can also ask a police officer to collect your application and supporting documents, and take your biometric data (fingerprints). You will need a medical certificate to confirm that your mobility is impaired. If you lack mental capacity, your representative will need to provide a medical certificate confirming your condition.</p>

<p>If you have problems with your request for a biometric residence document, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.astynomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=98922&amp;Itemid=133&amp;lang=EN" rel="external">contact the Department of Citizenship, Homogeneous and European Union Citizens of Aliens Division of the Hellenic Police Headquarters</a>.</p>

<p>If you need further information on how to secure your residency, you may find useful the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.airecentre.org/eurobrits-greece" rel="external">EuroBrits Greece guidance on residency</a>.</p>

<h3>Appeals process</h3>

<p>If your biometric residence document application is refused, the refusal letter will explain how you can appeal. You must appeal within 20 days of the refusal decision. You will be given a Certificate of Legal Residence (Ειδική Βεβαίωση Νόμιμης Διαμονής). This shows that you continue to have full Withdrawal Agreement rights until there is a final decision on your appeal.</p>

<p>The Director of the relevant Aliens Division will make a decision within 30 days. If your appeal is refused, you can make a further appeal to the Administrative courts. You can continue to stay in Greece until you get a decision on this appeal.</p>

<p>If your appeals are refused, you may be able to apply for the relevant permit under the rules for third country nationals. A third country national is someone who does not have EU, EEA or Swiss nationality.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Greece at any time in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Greek authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-greece#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Greece.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Greece</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/greece/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Greece travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Greece using your EU or EFTA country passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Greece with a Greek residence document or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Greece, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Greece before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel, in addition to your valid passport, carry your residence document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registration certificate ‘Veveosi Engrafis - Βεβαίωση Εγγραφής’ or</li>
  <li>permanent residence certificate ‘Engrafo Monimis Diamonis - Έγγραφο Μόνιμης Διαμονής’ if you registered before 1 January 2021 or</li>
  <li>residence document ‘Engrafo Diamonis 18 (4) WA - Έγγραφο διαμονής 18 (4) ΣΑ’, issued under the Withdrawal Agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of registration.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are resident in Greece, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit.
