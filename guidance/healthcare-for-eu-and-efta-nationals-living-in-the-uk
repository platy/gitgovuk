<p>The UK will leave the EU on 31 October. This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit. It will be updated if anything changes, including if a deal is agreed.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>

<p>If you are living in the UK before Brexit, make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="#s1-certificate">register or apply for an S1 certificate</a>, if you are eligible</li>
  <li><a href="#student">have a valid European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Heath Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>), if you are a student</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-healthcare-in-england">Getting healthcare in England</h2>

<p>This section is about getting healthcare in England. The way you access healthcare in <a href="#scotland-wales-northern-ireland">Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</a> could be different from England if there is a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>You will be able to access free NHS treatment in England until the UK leaves the EU if you are ordinarily resident in the UK. To be considered ordinarily resident, you must be living in the UK on a lawful and properly settled basis for the time being. You may be asked for evidence of this.</p>

<p>If you are living lawfully in the UK on exit day, you will be able to use the NHS in England, as you can now, after that date. If you are not ordinarily resident in the UK, you will be an overseas visitor and may be charged for NHS services.</p>

<p>The UK government is aiming to agree reciprocal healthcare arrangements either with the EU or with individual countries if there is a no-deal Brexit. Reciprocal healthcare provides urgent, immediate or planned medical treatment at a reduced cost or, in some cases, free.</p>

<p>If you are moving to the UK after exit day and there is no deal, you should check with your health insurance authority what has been agreed.</p>

<h2 id="efta">Agreement with Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland</h2>
<p>The UK has agreed citizens’ rights agreements with Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, which will apply if there is a no-deal Brexit. These agreements mean that citizens of these countries living lawfully in the UK on the day the UK leaves the EU will be able to use the NHS as they do now.</p>

<p>These agreements do not cover citizens of these countries who move to the UK after Brexit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/swiss-citizens-rights-agreement-and-explainer">Find out more about the Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eea-efta-no-deal-citizens-rights-agreement-and-explainer">Find out more about the EEA <abbr title="European Free Trade Area">EFTA</abbr> Citizens’ Rights Agreement</a> (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein)</p>

<h2 id="agreement-with-ireland">Agreement with Ireland</h2>

<p>Irish citizens who live in the UK, and British citizens who live in Ireland, will continue to have healthcare cover in the country they live in after Brexit. This is because of longstanding arrangements under the Common Travel Area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/citizens-rights-uk-and-irish-nationals-in-the-common-travel-area/citizens-rights-uk-and-irish-nationals-in-the-common-travel-area">Find out more information on the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland</a></p>

<h2 id="student">Studying in England</h2>

<p>You can continue to use your <abbr title="European Heath Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC) to access free NHS healthcare if you have begun a course of education or training in England before the UK leaves the EU. This will apply until the end of your course, even if it finishes after exit day.</p>

<p>If you start your education or training in England after the UK leaves the EU, your <abbr title="European Heath Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid. You should buy insurance to cover your healthcare as you would if visiting another non-EU country.</p>

<p>This would not affect the rights of individuals covered by the <a href="#efta">citizens’ rights agreements with Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/visiting-or-moving-to-england/">Find out more about accessing healthcare in England</a></p>

<h2 id="s1-certificate">S1 certificate</h2>

<p>Under current rules, an S1 certificate helps you and your dependants to be covered for healthcare when you are living in the UK.</p>

<p>If you are living in England on the day the UK leaves the EU, your S1 will still be valid in England after that date.</p>

<p>You can continue to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. However, it may not be valid if you arrive in England after exit day, depending on what arrangements have been reached with the EU or individual countries.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have worked and paid contributions in EU countries, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland</li>
  <li>receive certain benefits, such as a pension, from EU countries, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland</li>
</ul>

<p>You should apply to the health insurance authority in the relevant country, if you are eligible. You must register your S1 in England to access NHS care in the same way as someone who is ordinarily resident.</p>

<p>If you are a citizen of Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland and living in the UK on exit day, your S1 will still be valid after that date because of the citizens’ rights agreements with those countries. If you do not have an S1, you can still apply to your health insurance authority for an S1 after exit day.</p>

<p>If there’s no deal, the UK and Spain have each taken steps to ensure that people living in each country can continue to access healthcare as they do now until at least 31 December 2020. This means that if you’re a citizen of Spain and living in the UK on exit day, you’ll be able to use your Spanish-issued S1 form after exit day until at least 31 December 2020.</p>
