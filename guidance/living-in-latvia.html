</ul>

<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Latvia before 1 January 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>. You must apply for a new residence status by 30 June 2021 to secure your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Latvia before 1 January 2021, you must apply for a new residency document by 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>To apply, fill in the â€˜sample applicationâ€™ form on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/home/services/information-on-brexit.html" rel="external">Latvian Governmentâ€™s Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs (OCMA) â€˜Information on Brexitâ€™ website</a>.</p>

<p>Send the completed form with a copy of your passport by post, or electronically with a secure electronic signature, to the <a href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/home/contacts/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">regional division of OCMA</a> where you would like to pick up your new residence document. You will be able to collect the new residence document from January 2021 onwards.</p>

<p>If you have not previously registered and have been living in Latvia for more than 90 days, you must <a rel="external" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/residence-permits-0#1" class="govuk-link">register with the OCMA for a residence permit</a>.</p>

<p>Once you are resident in Latvia you must also declare your place of residence. You can do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at your <a rel="external" href="http://www.lps.lv/lv/kontakti/pasvaldibu-kontakti/" class="govuk-link">local municipality</a> (in Latvian)</li>
  <li>at the <a rel="external" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/residence-permits-0#1" class="govuk-link">OCMA</a>
</li>
  <li>online through the <a href="https://www.latvija.lv/epakalpojumi/ep15/apraksts" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Public Administration Services Portal</a> (in Latvian)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to Latvia</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/latvia/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Latvia</a>.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Latvia. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Latvia, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Latvia.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Latvia.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Latvia, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing.  You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit do not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Driving in Latvia</h2>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.csdd.lv/en/obtaining-and-exchange-of-driving-licence/obtaining-and-exchange-of-driving-licence">exchange your UK licence for a Latvian driving licence</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Latvia</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Latvia, you must register your car and make the necessary changes so that it is suitable for left-hand driving. You have 6 months from the date you registered your residency to do this. <a href="https://www.csdd.lv/en/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">The Latvian Road Traffic Safety Directorate</a> has more information.</p>

<p>You can read the EUÂ´s <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on car registration and taxes</a> in Latvia. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so, you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h3>Driving in the UK with a Latvian licence</h3>

<p>You can use your Latvian licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test. We will update these pages if there are any changes to the rules, as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are a permanent resident of Latvia, you are entitled to the same healthcare as Latvian nationals. If you are a temporary resident and live in Latvia in connection with your employment or you are self-employed, you and your family members can receive state-funded healthcare services.</p>

<p>Read our guidance  on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-latvia" class="govuk-link">healthcare in Latvia</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Latvia temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-latvia#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Latvia before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other â€˜exportable benefitsâ€™</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Latvia and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-latvia#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Latvia</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Latvia, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC for healthcare in Latvia.</p>

<p>If you were living in Latvia before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC if youâ€™re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Latvia</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a>.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<p>For more information read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">guidance on healthcare when travelling in Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#travel-eu" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>finding an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/latvia-list-of-medical-facilities" class="govuk-link">English-speaking doctor in Latvia</a>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">checking your prescriptions are legal in Latvia</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Working in Latvia</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Latvia before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in an EU country</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may need you to apply for a <a href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UK criminal records check</a>.</p>

<p>Your employer will need to apply to the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.vid.gov.lv/en">State Revenue Service</a> for your unique tax code. If you already have a personal code in Latvia, they will use this. Your employer is responsible for deducting your income tax and social security payments from your income.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed, you must register with the tax authorities yourself. You will be responsible for calculating and paying your tax and social security contributions.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Latvia and commute to work in an EU or EFTA country, from January 2021 you may need a permit to prove that you are a frontier worker. We will update this guidance when more information is available.</p>

<h2>Studying in Latvia</h2>

<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Latvian nationals, as long as you were legally resident in Latvia before 1 January 2021. You must apply for a residence permit in Latvia.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-students-in-the-eu-continuing-your-studies">continuing your studies in the European Union</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-latvia#studying-in-latvia">healthcare for students in Latvia</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to Latvia to study</h3>

<p>If you are planning to study in Latvia, make sure you meet all visa requirements before you arrive. Contact the relevant Higher Education provider in Latvia to check what fees you may have to pay.</p>

<p>For more information read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-european-union-after-brexit">studying in the European Union</a>.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Latvia to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Latvia have not changed.</p>
