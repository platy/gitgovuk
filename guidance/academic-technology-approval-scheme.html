<p>The Academic Technology Approval Scheme (<abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr>) applies to all international students and researchers (apart from exempt nationalities) who are subject to UK immigration control and are intending to study or research at postgraduate level in certain sensitive subjects.</p>

<p>The subjects and research areas are those where knowledge could be used in programmes to develop Advanced Conventional Military Technology (ACMT), weapons of mass destruction (<abbr title="Weapons of mass destruction">WMDs</abbr>) or their means of delivery. Researchers and students in these sensitive subjects must apply for an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (<abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr>) certificate before they can study or start research in the UK.</p>

<p>Students and researchers who are nationals of EU countries, the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland or the United States of America do not need an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate.</p>

<p>Researchers and students of all other nationalities must apply for an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate. You must apply if you are undertaking a postgraduate course or research in certain sensitive subjects in the UK. If you are applying to study an undergraduate course with an integrated masters year you may also need <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> clearance.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>The entry clearance officer (<abbr title="Entry clearance officer">ECO</abbr>) will ask to see your <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate as part of your application for permission to enter the UK. A caseworker will also need to see your <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate as part of an application for permission to stay in the UK.</p>

<p>UK immigration law does not allow universities to permit international students or researchers to study or undertake research in an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> applicable course until the student or researcher has provided the university or research institute with the correct <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate.</p>

<h2>Students</h2>

<p>If you’re a new student and need an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate, you will need to get this before applying for permission to enter the UK.</p>

<p>When you have received your offer from your university you should apply 6 months before your course will start.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate is valid for 6 months from the date it is issued, to enable applicants time to apply for their visa.</p>

<p>You should apply for your <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate as early as possible from when you have received a conditional offer to study at a UK Higher Education Institution (<abbr title="Higher Education Institution">HEI</abbr>).</p>

<p>Make sure your <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate will not expire before you apply for your UK visa.</p>

<h2>Already in the UK on the student route (including Tier 4)</h2>

<p>If you’re already in the UK on a student visa you will need an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate for the <abbr title="Higher Education Institution">HEI</abbr> you are attending, and the course of study, including modules or proposed research. If any of these details change, you should check whether you need an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate and apply for a new one as appropriate.</p>

<p>You should make a note of when your permission to enter into the UK is due to expire, to allow sufficient time to complete your <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> and permission to stay applications before your current permission expires. We recommend applying at least 4 months before your current permission expires.</p>

<h2>Already in the UK on a non-student visa</h2>

<p>If you have Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK, you do not need an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate to study in the UK.</p>

<p>If you’re in the process of applying for asylum in the UK, you must apply for an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate to study in the UK.</p>

<p>All other time-limited visas need an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate if you are studying for an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr>-relevant qualification in the UK.</p>

<h2>Students and researchers applying to several universities</h2>

<p>Each certificate is specific to the course, research area and institution. You should submit an application for each programme of study or research area where <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> applies.</p>

<h2>If you’re writing your thesis</h2>

<p>You must apply for an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate if you are applying solely to write up your thesis and your previous visa required <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr></p>

<h2>Student visitors</h2>

<p>If you’re a student coming to the UK as a visitor, you will need to obtain an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate before starting research in the UK. You do not need to do this before you apply for a UK visa</p>

<h2>If you are starting your course overseas</h2>

<p>You only need to obtain an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate for when you plan to be studying in the UK. However be aware that you could be unsuccessful when you apply for an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate to come to the UK part of the way through your course.</p>

<p>Transnational courses may be subject to UK Export Control Legislation. Read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-controls-applying-to-academic-research">export controls on academic research</a>.</p>

<h2>Academic researchers</h2>

<p>If you’re an academic researcher applying on the Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility, Tier 5 International Agreement, and Government Authorised Exchange routes, you will need to apply for, and be granted, an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate before applying for a UK visa or permission to stay. You do not need to have a final employment contract before you apply for an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate. Your employer will advise whether you are to be employed under a standard occupational classification (SOC) that requires <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you’re a researcher coming to the UK as a visitor, you need to obtain an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate before beginning any relevant research activity in the UK. However you do not need to do so before you apply for a UK visa (where relevant).</p>

<p>If you need an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate as a visitor, you do not have to obtain this before applying for a visa but you should obtain it before travelling to the UK. The <abbr title="Higher Education Institution">HEI</abbr>/research institute must check the <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate before allowing the research to start, and if this is not provided you will not be permitted on-site.</p>

<h2>If you are a researcher already in the UK</h2>

<p>You do not need to apply for an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are already conducting research in the UK</li>
  <li>were a visitor conducting research in the UK before the requirement for <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificates was introduced on 21 May 2021, and you are continuing this research</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to apply for an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are already conducting research in the UK and you apply for a new visa or apply to extend your current visa</li>
  <li>were a visitor conducting research in the UK before the requirement for <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificates was introduced on 21 May 2021 and are returning to the UK to do research</li>
  <li>hold an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate for a UK course you have undertaken are making a new application for a Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility, Tier 5 International Agreement, or Tier 5 Government Authorised Exchange visa. You need it before you apply for a visa</li>
  <li>change your field of research or change where you conduct your research</li>
</ul>

<h2>Researchers also undertaking a course of study</h2>

<p>Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility, Tier 5 International Agreement, and Tier 5 Government Authorised Exchange visa holders may also undertake a course of study. You need to apply for 1 <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate but you should include both the research project and study activities in your application.</p>

<h2>If your circumstances change after <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate is issued</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate must accurately reflect the <abbr title="Higher Education Institution">HEI</abbr>/research institute which employs/hosts your research, and the research project, job title and duration. If any of these details change you should check whether you require an 
<abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate and apply for a new certificate if you need one.</p>

<p>Researchers applying for <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> can begin their employment or research 2 weeks before, or any time after the start date stated on their certificate.</p>

<p>Make a note of when your permission to enter into the UK is due to expire, and allow sufficient time to complete the <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> and permission to stay application processes before your current permission expires. We recommend applying at least 4 months before your current permission expires.</p>

<h2>Conducting research at more than 1 <abbr title="Higher Education Institution">HEI</abbr>/research institutes</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate is applicable to one <abbr title="Higher Education Institution">HEI</abbr>/research institute. If you are conducting research at more than 1 institute, you need to apply for an <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> certificate for each, which including information on the research you will undertake at each <abbr title="Higher Education Institution">HEI</abbr>/research institute.</p>

<h2>How long applications take</h2>

<p>Student and researcher&nbsp;<abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr>&nbsp;applications take at least 20 working days (4 full weeks) to process. If you apply between April and September, it can take at least 30 working days to complete.</p>

<p>To ensure fairness and consistency we process applications in order of receipt. There is no ‘fast track’ service. You should submit your <abbr title="Academic Technology Approval Scheme">ATAS</abbr> application as early as possible.</p>

<h2>What you need to apply</h2>

<p>To apply online you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information about your programme of study/research including the relevant CAH3 code, provided by the <abbr title="Higher Education Institution">HEI</abbr>/ research institute</li>
  <li>for student applications only, your conditional offer letter from your Higher Education Institution (<abbr title="Higher Education Institution">HEI</abbr>)</li>
</ul>
