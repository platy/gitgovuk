<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, you may need different documentation to run or work on cross-border and domestic <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> rail services.</p>

<h2 id="agreements-for-cross-border-rail-services">Agreements for cross-border rail services</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, bilateral arrangements regarding cross-border rail services will be pursued to secure them for the long term.</p>

<p>We have already made considerable progress supporting rail operators to take their own steps to ensure that they are able to continue cross-border rail services. These steps are now in place.</p>

<p>In the absence of any bilateral or multilateral arrangements, cross-border operators would be subject to the same recognition principles in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> in relation to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> issued operator licences, safety certificates and train driver licences as outlined in this notice.</p>

<h2 id="legislation-and-conventions-for-cross-border-rail-services">Legislation and conventions for cross-border rail services</h2>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/contents/enacted">European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018</a> will bring <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law onto the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> statute book on <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit day. Our rail <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit legislative programme also ensures that the statute book will continue to function effectively after <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit day, thereby providing certainty, including in critical fields such as rail safety.</p>

<p>We would also continue to meet our obligations as a member of the <a rel="external" href="https://cit-rail.org/en/rail-transport-law/cotif">Convention concerning international carriage by rail</a> (<abbr title="Convention concerning international carriage by rail">COTIF</abbr>) in all scenarios. <abbr title="Convention concerning international carriage by rail">COTIF</abbr> establishes uniform rules that govern international rail transport. The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> are parties to <abbr title="Convention concerning international carriage by rail">COTIF</abbr> and these uniform rules.</p>

<h2 id="recognition-of-documentation">Recognition of documentation</h2>

<p>We are seeking mutual recognition of all documentation so that operators from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> can continue to run cross-border rail services without disruption after <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit.</p>

<p>The European Commission’s technical notice on rail transport says that certificates and licences issued by the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s national safety and licensing authority, the Office of Rail and Road (<abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr>), will not be valid in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.</p>

<p>However, to help secure the continuation of cross-border services between the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and France and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Ireland, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has adopted <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0503&from=EN">Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 2019/503 (PDF, 395KB)</a> on certain aspects of railway safety and connectivity. This gives a temporary 9-month extension to the validity of documents needed to run rail services.</p>

<p>This means that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-issued operator licences, authorisations, safety certificates and train driver licences will continue to be valid in the cross-border area (Calais-Fréthun in France and Dundalk in Ireland) for 9 months from the date of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit. The government fully supports this measure and expects all rail operators to meet the requirements set out in the Regulation.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will recognise certain <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-issued documentation for a limited period after <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit day. This includes operator licences, safety certificates, and train driving licences.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-operators will need to apply to the <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr> for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> documentation to run services in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. This should have minimal impact on business and it will be a straightforward application process. <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> operators need to prepare and allow enough time to apply for this documentation.</p>

<h2 id="participation-in-the-eu-agency-for-railways">Participation in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Agency for Railways</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Agency for Railways (<abbr title="EU Agency for Railways">EUAR</abbr>) works with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries and stakeholders to develop technical specifications for interoperability and the safety regime.</p>

<p>After the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will have the flexibility to align with or diverge from new rules and standards developed by the <abbr title="EU Agency for Railways">EUAR</abbr>. We will only diverge where there are clear arguments for doing so and after fully engaging with industry to assess the impact - particularly the commercial and cost impact to industry.</p>

<p>To enable this flexibility, we do not intend to seek formal participation in the <abbr title="EU Agency for Railways">EUAR</abbr> if there’s no <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit deal. We do, however, encourage the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> rail industry to work with <abbr title="EU Agency for Railways">EUAR</abbr> at technical and working levels.</p>

<h2 id="rail-passenger-rights">Rail passenger rights</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, the rights for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> passengers on both domestic and cross-border rail services will not change.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Passengers using cross-border services must ensure that their insurance and ticket terms and conditions cover possible disruption.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="operator-licences">Operator licences</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, there will be no impact on <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-based domestic operators using <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr>-issued licences. This includes subsidiaries of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> owned operators using <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr>-issued licences.</p>

<p>Under (<a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/700/contents/made">The Railway (Licensing of Railway Undertakings) (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019</a>) licences issued by an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country will be valid for operators in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for up to 2 years from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit day. At this point you will need to apply to the <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr> for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-licence to continue operating. You do not need to be established in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to do this.</p>

<p>The European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) has said that operators who hold an <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr>-issued licence and run domestic services in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will need to re-apply for an operator licence in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country. This also applies to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-based operators seeking to run new domestic services in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you need to re-apply for an operator licence you should do so as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="safety-certificates">Safety certificates</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr>-issued Part A and Part B safety certificates will still be valid for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-based operators who only operate domestically.</p>

<p>Non-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> based operators running a domestic-only service in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> with a Part A safety certificate issued in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, can continue using these certificates for up to 2 years from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit or until they expire - whichever is earlier. At this point you would need to apply to the <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr> for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Part A certificate and renew the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Part B safety certificates to continue operating. You do not need to be established in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to do this.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/837/contents/made">The Rail Safety (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019</a> is the first of 2 instruments affecting the required changes to the safety regime. The next piece of legislation will provide for the time-limited recognition. In the interim, the status quo has been retained.</p>

<p>Further information can be found in the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/837/memorandum/contents">explanatory memorandum to the Regulations</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will continue to recognise safety certificates issued in Northern Ireland on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr>-issued Part B safety certificates will be valid until they expire and will not be subject to a time-limited period. The exception to this is where a Part A certificate issued in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country expires or is subject to the 2-year limit. In this case, the associated <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr>-issued Part B certificate needs to be renewed at the same time.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> has said that if there’s no exit deal, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-based operators running domestic services in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> who hold an <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr>-issued Part A safety certificate would need to re-apply for a Part A safety certificate in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.

<h2 id="entities-in-charge-of-maintenance-certificates">Entities in charge of maintenance certificates</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, the validity of entities in charge of maintenance (<abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECM</abbr>) certificates issued in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by the <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr> or a certification body will be unchanged for freight vehicles running purely on the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> mainline.</p>

<p><abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECMs</abbr> that hold a certificate issued in another country can continue using these certificates for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operations. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> recognises these certificates through our international obligations under <abbr title="Convention concerning international carriage by rail">COTIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> has said that <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECMs</abbr> who maintain freight vehicles in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and who hold a certificate issued in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by the <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr> or a recognised body will need to apply for a new <abbr title="entities in charge of maintenance">ECM</abbr> certificate from a certification body in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<h2 id="train-driving-licences">Train driving licences</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, there will be no impact for operators in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> using licences and certificates issued in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>For operators in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, drivers using licences and certificates issued in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will be able to continue using this documentation for up to 2 years from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit day or until they expire, whichever is earlier. At this point drivers working for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operator must apply to the <abbr title="Office of Rail and Road">ORR</abbr> for a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licence to continue operating in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The validity of certificates in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is unaffected by changes to the licence, however, operators must ensure that certificates held by newly re-licensed drivers and their registers of those certificates refer to the new licence. This is legislated in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2019/9780111180761">The Train Driving Licences and Certificates (Amendment) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will continue to recognise driving licences and certificates issued in Northern Ireland on an ongoing basis.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you currently drive trains into an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country on a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> licence, you will need a new <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> licence and certification documents from the national safety authority of the country you wish to drive into.

<h2 id="interoperability-constituents">Interoperability constituents</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will continue to recognise interoperability constituents with certificates of conformity from an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> notified body unless the applicable <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> technical standards diverge from the standards set by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where there is divergence in respect of a specific interoperability constituent, a reassessment against the divergent standard is required by a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> conformity assessment body. The same principle applies to certificates of verification for subsystems.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> has said that an interoperability constituent placed on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market before <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit with a certificate of conformity from a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> notified body can be used for the period of validity of that certificate in subsystems or vehicles authorised before <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit day. Certification from a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> notified body will not be valid for interoperability constituents placed on the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> market after <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit.</p>

<h2 id="vehicle-authorisations">Vehicle authorisations</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, vehicle authorisations already issued within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> before <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit will retain their validity in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>If vehicles were first authorised outside of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, an added authorisation to place into service will be mandatory for the first use of vehicles in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> after <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit. This system will be operated in accordance with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s <abbr title="Convention concerning international carriage by rail">COTIF</abbr> international obligations. This requirement should not cause disruption as it is effectively formalising current practice. Additional vehicle authorisation is generally always sought to ensure compliance with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s non-harmonised technical rules.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> has said that vehicle authorisations delivered in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> prior to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit would remain valid. After the withdrawal date, authorisations for placing in service in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> would be based on certificates of verification issued by notified bodies in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</p>

<h2 id="rail-freight-corridor">Rail freight corridor</h2>

<p>A rail freight corridor (<abbr title="rail freight corridor">RFC</abbr>) is constituted of railway lines, linking 2 or more terminals along a predefined principal route crossing more than one <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.

If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will no longer be a member of the North Sea - Mediterranean rail freight corridor. The impact of this will be minimal as the corridor has only ever been used once in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="iceland-norway-liechtenstein-and-switzerland">Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland</h2>

<p>In many areas, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland adopt <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules. Where this is the case, this technical notice may also apply to them, and businesses and citizens in <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Switzerland should consider whether they need to take any steps to prepare for a ‘no deal’ scenario.</p>
