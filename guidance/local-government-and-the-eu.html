<p>This page brings together key guidance and information to help local government adapt to new rules now that the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the transition period has ended.</p>

<p>The Department for Levelling Up, Housing &amp; Communities (DLUHC) sends a daily Local Government Bulletin (Monday to Friday) with updates on the latest government guidance, advice, communications products and other useful information about coronavirus (COVID-19), new rules and other topics of interest for local government.</p>

<h2>Updated approach to import controls to help ease the cost of living</h2>

<p>The government has concluded that it would be wrong to impose new administrative requirements on businesses who may pass-on the associated costs to consumers.</p>

<p>The remaining import controls on <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> goods will no longer be introduced this year, which the government announced on 28 April 2022.</p>

<p>Instead, traders will continue to move their goods from the European Union to Great Britain as they do now.</p>

<p>Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, and the recent rise in global energy costs, have had a significant effect on supply chains that are still recovering from the pandemic.</p>

<p>The government has therefore concluded that it would be wrong to impose new administrative requirements on businesses who may pass-on the associated costs to consumers already facing pressures on their finances.</p>

<p>The change in approach is expected to save British importers at least £1 billion in annual costs.</p>

<p>The government will now review how to implement these remaining controls in an improved way. The new Target Operating Model will be based on a better assessment of risk and will harness the power of data and technology. It will be published in the Autumn and the new controls regime will come into force at the end of 2023.</p>

<p>This process will build on existing work already taking place as part of the 2025 Border Strategy, including on the UK Single Trade Window – a new digital platform that will help traders to more easily move goods globally. Our goal is to create a seamless new ‘digital’ border, where technologies and real-time data will cut queues and smooth trade.</p>

<p>The controls introduced in January 2021 on the highest risk imports of animals, animal products, plants and plant products will continue to apply alongside the customs controls which have already been introduced.</p>

<p>Specifically, the following controls which were planned for introduction from July 2022 will now not be introduced:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A requirement for further Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks on <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> imports currently at destination to be moved to Border Control Post (BCP).</li>
  <li>A requirement for safety and security declarations on <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> imports.</li>
  <li>A requirement for further health certification and SPS checks for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> imports.</li>
  <li>Prohibitions and restrictions on the import of chilled meats from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-04-28/hcws796" rel="external">written ministerial statement</a> from the Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government, efficiency, Jacob Rees-Mogg provides further details covering this government announcement.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The government has published an overarching <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/summary-the-uks-new-relationship-with-the-eu">explainer</a> which gives an overview of what the UK-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> free trade deal means in practice now the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The explainer also includes a broader guide to ‘life after Brexit’ with links to guidance on the range of actions businesses and citizens may need to take.</p>

<p>You can check what else you may need to do to adapt by answering the questions on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">Brexit checker</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has now formally adopted ‘adequacy decisions’ for the UK, which allow for the ongoing free flow of personal data from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/EEA to the UK. In doing so, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has formally recognised the UK’s high data protection standards.</p>

<p>The decisions mean that UK businesses and organisations can continue to receive personal data from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/EEA without having to put additional arrangements in place with European counterparts.</p>

<p>The ICO is consulting on how organisations can continue to protect people’s personal data when it is transferred outside of the UK. The consultation closed on 11 October 2021.</p>

<h3>Local Elections</h3>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> citizens who have been resident in the UK since before 31 December 2020 and have lawful status will retain their voting and candidacy rights.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> citizens who arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020, voting and candidacy rights will be granted only to citizens of those countries with which the UK has voting rights agreements. These agreements will enable UK nationals living in those countries to vote in their local elections, and citizens from those nations living here to vote in our local elections.</p>

<p>For citizens of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries where there is no reciprocal agreement in place, they will no longer be able to vote or stand in local elections in England or Northern Ireland, NI Assembly elections, or PCC elections in England or Wales from the time these measures come into effect.</p>
