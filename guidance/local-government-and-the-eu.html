<p>This page brings together key guidance and information to help local government adapt to new rules now that the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the transition period has ended.</p>

<p>The Department for Levelling Up, Housing &amp; Communities (DLUHC) sends a daily Local Government Bulletin (Monday to Friday) with updates on the latest government guidance, advice, communications products and other useful information about coronavirus (COVID-19), new rules and other topics of interest for local government.</p>

<h2>Upcoming key milestones</h2>

<p>On 14 September 2021, the government set out a new timetable for introducing full import controls for goods being imported from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to the UK. Full customs declarations and controls were introduced on 1 January 2022 as previously announced, although safety and security declarations will now not be required until 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>Under the revised timetable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The requirements for pre-notification of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) goods, which were due to be introduced on 1 October 2021, have now been introduced on 1 January 2022.</li>
  <li>The new requirements for Export Health Certificates, which were due to be introduced on 1 October 2021, will now be introduced on 1 July 2022.</li>
  <li>Phytosanitary Certificates and physical checks on SPS goods at Border Control Posts, due to be introduced on 1 January 2022, will now be introduced on 1 July 2022.</li>
  <li>Safety and Security declarations on imports will be required as of 1 July 2022 as opposed to 1 January 2022. Full customs declarations and controls have been introduced on 1 January 2022 as previously announced.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will provide businesses with further time to prepare for changes at the border and minimise disruption. A Written Ministerial Statement gives more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2021-09-14/hcws285" rel="external">details on the revised timetable for the introduction of controls</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The government has published an overarching <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/summary-the-uks-new-relationship-with-the-eu" class="govuk-link">explainer</a> which gives an overview of what the UK-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> free trade deal means in practice now the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The explainer also includes a broader guide to ‘life after Brexit’ with links to guidance on the range of actions businesses and citizens may need to take.</p>

<p>You can check what else you may need to do to adapt by answering the questions on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">Brexit checker</a>.</p>

<p>Citizens and businesses can also be directed to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transition" class="govuk-link">checker</a> to receive a personalised list of actions and sign up for email updates.

</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has now formally adopted ‘adequacy decisions’ for the UK, which allow for the ongoing free flow of personal data from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/EEA to the UK. In doing so, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has formally recognised the UK’s high data protection standards.</p>

<p>The decisions mean that UK businesses and organisations can continue to receive personal data from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/EEA without having to put additional arrangements in place with European counterparts.</p>

<p>The ICO is consulting on how organisations can continue to protect people’s personal data when it is transferred outside of the UK. The consultation closed on 11 October 2021.</p>

<h3>Local Elections</h3>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> citizens who have been resident in the UK since before 31 December 2020 and have lawful status will retain their voting and candidacy rights.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> citizens who arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020, voting and candidacy rights will be granted only to citizens of those countries with which the UK has voting rights agreements. These agreements will enable UK nationals living in those countries to vote in their local elections, and citizens from those nations living here to vote in our local elections.</p>

<p>For citizens of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries where there is no reciprocal agreement in place, they will no longer be able to vote or stand in local elections in England or Northern Ireland, NI Assembly elections, or PCC elections in England or Wales from the time these measures come into effect.</p>
