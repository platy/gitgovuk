<p>All medical devices, including <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, custom-made devices and systems or procedure packs, must be registered with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> before they can be placed on the market in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland).</p>

<p>In Great Britain devices must conform to the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/contents/made" rel="external">Medical Devices Regulations 2002</a> (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (UK <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr> 2002) as they apply in Great Britain so that they can be placed on the market and registered with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Registration requirements differ for <a class="govuk-link" href="#NI">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will only accept registration of devices from manufacturers or UK Responsible Persons that are based in the UK, or from Authorised Representatives based in Northern Ireland (for the purposes of the Northern Ireland market).</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

<p>Registering your devices with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> does not mean that we give you any form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accreditation</li>
  <li>certification</li>
  <li>approval for the device</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not claim this in any marketing materials, on the packaging or in the instructions for use.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If you are registering a Coronavirus (COVID-19) test kit with the MHRA please take note of our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work">guidance for industry and manufacturers</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>As part of our data validation and scrutiny of applications to register medical devices and products with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, we may request further technical documentation from you that demonstrates your products conform to the requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/contents" rel="external">Medical Device Regulations.</a></p>

<h2>Who must register</h2>
<p>The following requirements apply to place your device on the UK market.</p>

<h3>Placing a device on the Great Britain market</h3>
<p>It is a requirement of the UK <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr> 2002 that you inform the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> before you place your device on the market in Great Britain.</p>

<p>You must register if you or your company sells, leases, lends or gifts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Class I, IIa, IIb or III devices you have manufactured</li>
  <li>Class I, IIa, IIb or III devices you have refurbished or re-labelled with your own name</li>
  <li>any system or procedure pack containing at least one medical device</li>
  <li>custom-made devices</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> you have manufactured</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> undergoing performance evaluation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Register your device to place on the Great Britain market</h3>
<p>If the manufacturer is based outside of the UK, they must appoint a single UK Responsible Person to take responsibility for all of their medical devices.</p>

<p>Please note that the accounts of any former Great Britain-based Authorised Representatives that have not updated their role to UK Responsible Person on the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> registration system, as well as the accounts of any represented manufacturers, will be suspended from 1 January 2022 until the UK Responsible Person has updated their role.</p>

<p>The UK Responsible Person will then assume the responsibilities of the manufacturer in terms of registering the device with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulating-medical-devices-in-the-uk#responsible">See guidance for more information about the role of the UK Responsible Person</a>.</p>

<p>Where any changes to registrations are made, a Â£100 statutory fee will apply per application.</p>

<p>Distributors and suppliers are not required to register with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>In cases where the Great Britain importer is not the UK Responsible Person, the importer must inform the relevant manufacturer or UK Responsible Person of their intention to import a device.</p>

<p>In such cases, the UK Responsible Person or the manufacturer must provide the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> with the importer details, including their place of business in Great Britain.</p>

<h3>Placing a device on the Northern Ireland market</h3>
<p>In some circumstances, it is a requirement of the UK <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr> 2002 that you inform the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> when you first place your device on the Northern Ireland market. The precise requirements depend on the location of the manufacturer, the location of the Authorised Representative and the device class. Please see below for further information.</p>

<h3>Register your device to place on the Northern Ireland market</h3>

<h3>Requirements for non-UK manufacturers</h3>
<p>If you are a non-UK manufacturer, you may be required to appoint a single UK Responsible Person within the UK for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical device">IVD</abbr> List A products, <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical device">IVD</abbr> List B products and self-test <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> that are placed on the Northern Ireland market. A UK Responsible Person is not required on order to place <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> that do not fall within these device classifications on the Northern Ireland market.</p>

<p>Non-UK manufacturers are not required to appoint a UK Responsible Person for the purpose of placing general medical devices and active implantable medical devices on the Northern Ireland market.</p>

<p>The requirement to appoint a UK Responsible Person for the purposes of placing an <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical device">IVD</abbr> on the Northern Ireland market applies in cases where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are a manufacturer based in the EU or the EEA; and</li>
  <li>
    <p>place <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> on the Northern Ireland market that have not already been registered with an EU Competent Authority.</p>
  </li>
  <li>you are a manufacturer based outside the UK, the EU and the EEA; and</li>
  <li>have an Authorised Representative based outside Northern Ireland; and</li>
  <li>place <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> on the Northern Ireland market that have not already been registered with an EU Competent Authority.</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK Responsible Person will then assume the responsibilities of the manufacturer in terms of registering the device with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulating-medical-devices-in-the-uk#responsible">See guidance for more information about the role of the UK Responsible Person</a>.</p>

<h3>Requirements for Great Britain-based manufacturers placing devices on the Northern Ireland market</h3>
<p>Great Britain manufacturers must designate an Authorised Representative based in the EU or Northern Ireland in order to place a device on the Northern Ireland market.</p>

<p>Where an EU-based Authorised Representative is appointed, the Great Britain-based manufacturer must register all device classes other than Class I devices and general <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where a Northern Ireland-based Authorised Representative is appointed, the Authorised Representative must register all devices with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Please note that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/905/contents/made" rel="external">new requirements</a> have recently been introduced regarding the registration of custom-made devices in Northern Ireland. Please see below for further information.</p>

<p>Distributors and suppliers are not required to register with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Registration of importers</h3>
<p>The Northern Ireland-based Authorised Representative or UK Responsible Person must provide the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> with details of the person placing the product on the Northern Ireland market if the person placing the product on the market is not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The manufacturer, or</li>
  <li>The Northern Ireland-based Authorised Representative, or</li>
  <li>The UK Responsible Person (for <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> only)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registration of custom-made devices in Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>We have recently introduced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/905/contents/made" rel="external">legislation</a> to supplement provisions that were introduced in Northern Ireland on 26 May 2021 when the EU Medical Devices Regulation (2017/745) (EU <abbr title="Medical Device Regulations">MDR</abbr>) took effect. This legislation has introduced a requirement to register all custom-made devices with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> within 28 days of being made available on the Northern Ireland market.</p>

<h2>When you must register</h2>

<h3>When to register a device on the Great Britain market</h3>

<p>All medical devices, including <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, custom-made devices and systems or procedure packs must be registered with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> before they can be placed on the Great Britain market.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2022, non-UK manufacturers will require a UK Responsible Person for the purposes of registering devices placed on the Great Britain market. A Northern Ireland-based Authorised Representative will no longer be able to register devices on a manufacturerâ€™s behalf for the Great Britain market.</p>

<p>Failure to register your devices will mean that you are unable to lawfully place your device on the Great Britain market.</p>

<h3>When to register a device on the Northern Ireland market</h3>
<p>There is currently a requirement to register with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, certain medical devices (including <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr>, custom-made devices and systems and procedure packs) that are placed on the Northern Ireland market.</p>

<p>This requirement does not apply to manufacturers placing Class I medical devices or general <abbr title="in vitro diagnostic medical devices">IVDs</abbr> on the Northern Ireland market in cases where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the manufacturer is based in the EU or EEA, OR</li>
  <li>the manufacturer is based outside Northern Ireland, the EU or EEA and has appointed an EU-based Authorised Representative.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on registration of custom-made devices in Northern Ireland please see above.</p>

<h2>Information required when registering your devices with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>

<h2>Coronavirus Test Device Approval (CTDA) and Registering with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Under regulation 34A of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 no antigen or molecular detection COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) test may be placed on the UK market without first being validated against minimum performance standards through a Coronavirus Test Device Approvals desktop review. Persons wishing to supply, put into service or place on the UK market a coronavirus test device, need to apply to the UKâ€™s Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for approval.</p>

<p>Registration applications for covid test devices will not be accepted by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> until the devices have received Coronavirus Test Device Approval (CTDA) or are placed onto the Temporary Protocol list. If you believe your Covid test device is exempt from the approval requirements and wish to register it with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, it is probable you will be contacted to specify the exemption applicable under the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (as amended by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/910/contents/made" rel="external">The Medical Devices (Coronavirus Test Device Approvals) (Amendment) Regulations 2021</a> before your <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> registration application is accepted.</p>

<h2>Apply to register on the Device Online Registration System (<abbr title="Device Online Registration System">DORS</abbr>)</h2>
<p>You need to create an account on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mhrabpm.appiancloud.com/suite/plugins/servlet/registration" rel="external"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> <abbr title="Device Online Registration System">DORS</abbr></a> before you can start registering your devices.</p>

<p>We will email you to confirm if your account request has been accepted or rejected.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You will not be regarded as registered with the MHRA until you have provided details of the device you are registering and have received confirmation that your device is registered. You must ensure all information registered with the MHRA is accurate and up to date. We may request additional technical documentation from you to demonstrate your products conform to the relevant regulatory requirements before your registration is confirmed.</p>
</div>

<p>Registering your devices with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> does not mean that we give you any form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accreditation</li>
  <li>certification</li>
  <li>approval for the device</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not claim this in any marketing materials, on the packaging or in the instructions for use.</p>

<p>If you are registering devices as a UK Responsible Person or a Northern Ireland-based Authorised Representative, you also need to provide details of the manufacturer(s) you are representing. The above device registration process will then apply.</p>

<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>A statutory fee of Â£100 applies for each registration application.</p>

<p>You can register up to 100 devices (<abbr title="Global Medical Devices Nomenclature">GMDN</abbr>) with a cumulative maximum of 20,000 products (UDI-DI, medical device name, model or version, catalogue/reference detail) within each application.</p>

<p>If you need to update any information within an existing registration, you may be charged a Â£100 statutory fee. This includes updating a registration from a UK Authorised Representative to a UK Responsible Person.</p>

<p>See below for information on making changes to your registration.</p>

<h2>Review registration</h2>

<p>You should review your registration frequently to make sure it is up to date. It is a legal requirement to inform <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of any changes to your registration per section 7A (general medical devices), section 33A (in vitro diagnostic medical devices) and section 21A (active implantable medical devices) of the Medical Devices Regulations (2002) SI 618 (as amended) concerning registration of persons placing medical devices on the market, as and when they occur. Please do not wait for reminder emails.</p>

<p>Please review all your devices and products to ensure the data is correct and update any data fields that were not previously populated using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/FjGlIPjaYXsUvqge/fi" rel="external">Update registered devices and products functionality</a>. There is no fee to use this function.  In particular we urge you to provide the UDI-DIs for your devices as these will be crucial for monitoring and ensuring patient safety.</p>

<p>We have implemented a renew registration process as a reminder to review your registration and confirm that it is up to date. The first renewal date is 1 year after account creation and then at least every 2 years. You will receive automated email reminders 3, 2 and 1 month before your renewal date â€“ you can review and submit the Renew registration application from 3 months before the renewal date. There is no fee for this application.</p>

<p>If you do not review your registration and submit the Renew registration application your account will be suspended. Suspended accounts are removed from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/era/pdr.nsf/name?openpage&amp;start=1&amp;count=200" rel="external">Public Access Registration Database (PARD)</a> and you will not be able to add new devices or order Certificates of Free Sale until you have reviewed your registration and submitted the renewal application. Please follow the Renew Registration instructions in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-medical-devices-to-place-on-the-market#reference-guides">Account Management Reference Guide</a> and watch the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/dHkiyWC1H1MtEOYK/fi" rel="external">Renew Registration video tutorial</a>.</p>
