<h2>COVID-19 travel</h2>

<p><strong>Under current UK COVID-19 restrictions, you must stay at home. You must not travel, including abroad, unless you have a legally permitted reason to do so.

<p>Before you return to the UK you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">provide your journey and contact details</a>. You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control" class="govuk-link">self-isolate</a> when you enter the UK from any foreign country except Ireland, unless you have a valid exemption.

</div>

<h2>Plan for your travel: checklist</h2>

<p>Developments in the coronavirus pandemic remain uncertain around the world. No travel is risk-free, and many countries have closed their borders to UK travellers due to the new variant of the virus.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are in the UK you should not travel abroad. Under current UK COVID-19 restrictions, you must stay at home. You must not travel, including abroad, unless you have a legally permitted reason to do so. It is illegal to travel abroad for holidays and other leisure purposes.</p>
</div>

<p>You should check the guidance for your personal circumstances before deciding whether you can travel internationally.</p>

<p>If you are legally permitted to travel abroad and are planning travel in the future, even if you are returning to a place youâ€™ve visited before, follow this checklist.</p>

<h3>Before you travel</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>follow all the current rules for where you live. You need a legally permitted reason to leave your home, including to travel abroad.

  </li>
  <li>

Check â€˜entry requirementsâ€™ in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/" class="govuk-link">travel advice</a> and contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">UK-based embassy of the country youâ€™re travelling to</a> for more information</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h2>
<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr> travel advice</h2>
<p>Our travel advice explains that you must comply with the restrictions on travel,  both domestic and international, that apply in each nation across the UK. You must not leave home or travel, including abroad, unless you have a legally permitted reason to do so.</p>

<p>It sets out the risks that you may face if you go to another country, including non-COVID risks, if you are able to travel abroad.</p>

<p>We continue to advise against all non-essential international travel to some countries and territories. You should check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">country page</a> for your destination. We also currently advise against <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cruise-ship-travel">cruise ship travel</a>.</p>

<p>We are monitoring the international situation very closely and keeping this advice under constant review so that it reflects our latest assessment of risks to British people.â€¯ We take a range of factors into account.â€¯ For coronavirus, this includes the incidence rate and the resilience of healthcare provision in each country.â€¯ Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">how our travel advice works</a>.</p>

<h2>Consular help</h2>

<p>We publish all our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice on GOV.UK</a>. Our consular officers cannot provide any additional information by phone. Read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">consular support we provide</a>.</p>

<h2>If <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr> travel advice changes when you are abroad</h2>

<p>Travel advice is under constant review and may change at short notice, if risks in a country change.</p>

<p>Our travel advice may change while you are in a country to advise against all travel, or all but essential travel, because of COVID risks. If this happens, we do not advise you to return immediately to the UK. Instead, you should follow the local advice on any measures the local authorities are taking to control the virus before your return to the UK.</p>

<p>If you decide you wish to shorten your stay abroad because of a change in travel advice you should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>contact your airline and travel company to discuss your options</li>
  <li>check if you need to self-isolate on your return</li>
  <li>provide your journey and contact details before you travel using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">passenger locator form</a>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>If changes relating to the new COVID-19 variant mean you cannot return from travel abroad</h2>

<p>If you are travelling abroad and unable to return to the UK, contact your airline or travel provider for advice. You can also contact your nearest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies" class="govuk-link">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a> for urgent assistance.</p>

<h2>Quarantine while you are abroad</h2>

<p>If the local authority where you are proposes to quarantine you for your own protection, you should follow their advice.</p>

<p>If there are suspected cases of coronavirus where you are, you may need to remain in your hotel room or accommodation for 14 days, move to quarantine facilities and take tests for coronavirus. If you test positive, in some cases, you may need to be hospitalised abroad.</p>

<p>You should also contact your airline or travel company, and your insurance provider as soon as you can. We only organise assisted departure in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h2>Looking after your mental wellbeing</h2>

<p>Your emotional and mental wellbeing is important. Keep in regular contact with the people who usually support you: family, friends and colleagues, especially if you are self-isolating abroad.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/wellbeing-and-mental-health-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic">guidance on how to look after your wellbeing and mental health</a> if youâ€™re abroad during the current coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<h2>If you live abroad permanently</h2>

<p>As a permanent resident overseas, you should follow the advice of the local authorities where you are. Further information on COVID-19 measures that countries have taken is available in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a>.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 vaccines if you live abroad</h2>

<p>Wherever possible British nationals should aim to be vaccinated in their country of residence. We will share information on other countriesâ€™ national vaccine programmes on our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a> as they are announced. You can sign up to get email notifications when a countryâ€™s travel advice page is updated.</p>

<p>If you live overseas find out about the vaccines available locally, and contact your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/doctors-and-medical-facilities-worldwide-list" class="govuk-link">healthcare provider</a> for further advice. They can share the latest information about the national COVID-19 vaccination programme in the country where you live.</p>

<p>The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the UK authority responsible for assessing the safety, quality and efficacy of vaccines. It has authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines for temporary supply and use in the UK. Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/mhra-guidance-on-coronavirus-covid-19#vaccines-and-vaccine-safety">MHRA approval for these vaccines</a>.</p>

<p>British nationals living overseas should seek medical advice from their local healthcare provider in the country where they reside. Information about vaccines used in other national programmes, including regulatory status, should be available from the local authorities. This <a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/who-listed-authority-reg-authorities/SRAs" class="govuk-link" rel="external">list of Stringent Regulatory Authorities recognised by the World Health Organisation</a> may also be a useful source of additional information.</p>
