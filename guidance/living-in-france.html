<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in France before 1 January 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>. You must apply for a new residence status by 1 July 2021 to secure your rights.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">guidance on living in Europe.</a></p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in France before 1 January 2021, you must <a href="https://contacts-demarches.interieur.gouv.fr/brexit/brexit-residence-permit-application/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">apply online for the new residency permit</a> before 1 July 2021, in line with the Withdrawal Agreement. You need to have your new residency permit before 1 October 2021.</p>

<p>All UK nationals resident in France need to apply for the new residency permit. This includes UK nationals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with a European carte de séjour (even if it is marked “permanent”, or has no expiry date)</li>
  <li>without a European carte de séjour (it was previously optional)</li>
  <li>applying for a second nationality</li>
  <li>married to or in a civil partnership with (known as PACSed) FR or other EU nationals</li>
</ul>

<p>Each person must make a separate application. Children under 18 do not need to apply, unless they need a residency permit to work or will turn 18 close to the application deadline.</p>

<p>If you have been living in France for over 5 years, you will be eligible for permanent residency and a 10-year renewable residency permit.</p>

<p>If you have been living in France for fewer than 5 years, you will be eligible for a card with 5 years’ validity. You will need to provide evidence of your personal situation (as a worker, self-sufficient person, student, job seeker, British family member, British spouse of a French national). Read the flowchart on the application website which shows <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://accueil.contacts-demarches.interieur.gouv.fr/media/uploads/2020/12/04/tableau-cas-d-usages-brexit-v7-19112020-en.pdf">what documents you need to provide</a>.</p>

<p>If you applied for residency via the previous ‘no-deal’ website, you do not need to re-apply. Your application will be processed by the appropriate Préfecture before 1 October 2021. However if you have moved to a different Departement since applying, you must apply again.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Additional support</h3>

<p>UK nationals who are resident in France, and need help to complete their residence application or registration, can get support from organisations funded by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-allocates-3-million-to-support-uk-nationals-in-the-eu" class="govuk-link">UK Nationals Support Fund</a>.</p>

<p>Most UK nationals in France will be able to complete the simple online application by themselves. This support is only available to people who need additional help to secure their rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. They may include pensioners, disabled people, people living in remote areas or people who have mobility difficulties.</p>

<p>Support available includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>answering questions about residence applications, such as the documents you need and how the application process works</li>
  <li>guiding you through the process, if necessary</li>
  <li>support if you experience language barriers or difficulty accessing online information and services</li>
</ul>

<p>If you, or someone you know, are having difficulty completing residence paperwork or have any questions, contact the organisation that covers the region where you, or they, live.</p>

<h3>Moving to France</h3>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france/entry-requirements">entry requirements for France</a> and read the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N105">French government guidance on moving to France</a> (in French).</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence permit (EU permit or Withdrawal Agreement permit) as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your permit, carry your certificate of application. You will have received this as an email.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence permit, you should carry evidence that you are resident in France. This could include a tenancy agreement, property rental receipts, or gas or electricity bills in your name dating from 2020.</p>

<p>Make sure you show your residence permit, or other residence proof, any time you are asked to show your passport at border control.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in France, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in France.</p>

<h4>Passports</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from France.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to France, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h4>Entry requirements</h4>

<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each country’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register for healthcare as a resident in France, and in addition, you can sign up for top-up health insurance (mutuelle).</p>

<p>If you are legally resident in France, you can get a French social security card for healthcare (carte vitale). To get a French social security card, you will need to register with your local Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie (CPAM). They can tell you which documents they need for your registration. Top-up insurance cover (mutuelle) also exists to cover the cost of healthcare not covered by a Carte Vitale.</p>

<p>If you have been resident in France for more than 3 months you can apply to be covered by the French healthcare system (PUMA).</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-france-including-martinique-and-guadaloupe" class="govuk-link">guidance on accessing healthcare in France</a> and make sure you are correctly registered. Read the French government <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://brexit.gouv.fr/sites/brexit/accueil/vous-etes-britannique-en/acces-aux-soins-en.html">guidance on access to healthcare</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in France before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in France, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC for healthcare in France.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in France</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in France&nbsp;and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country, before 1 January 2021&nbsp;you may need a permit to show you are a frontier worker.&nbsp;You must also apply for a residency permit in France. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you live in the UK or another EU of EFTA country and commuted to work in France before 1 January 2021 you need a permit. You must apply for this permit from the Prefecture where you work before 1 July 2021.</p>

<p>To apply, you need a valid passport, a recent facial photograph; a certificate of employment or proof of self-employed activity on French territory. See <a rel="external" href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000042576710" class="govuk-link">more detail in the Ministerial Order</a>.

<h3>Studying in France</h3>

<h3>Moving to France to study</h3>

<p>If you are planning to study in France, make sure you meet all visa requirements before you arrive. Contact the relevant Higher Education provider in France to check what fees you may have to pay.</p>

<p>University tuition fees for UK nationals coming to France to study from 1 January 2021 may be higher due to the French government’s reforms to public university tuition fees.</p>

<p>Increased fees will not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK students already enrolled on a course of study when the reforms were announced (September 2019) for the duration of that course</li>
  <li>UK students starting a course during the transition period, for the duration of that course</li>
</ul>

<p>Check with your grant provider for any <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.etudiant.gouv.fr/fr/vos-aides-financieres-1896">continued eligibility for student support</a> (in French) and read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.campusfrance.org/en/tuition-fees-France" class="govuk-link">Campus France guidance on tuition fee reforms</a>.

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with France to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in France have not changed.</p>
