<p>Each adult visitor is allowed to take in a maximum of £30 in coins (notes are not allowed). The money can be used to buy food and drink from the canteen in the visiting hall.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Buckley Hall. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Buckley Hall</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Buckley Hall.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>Prisoners can make calls during set hours:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monday to Friday, 8am to 8:30am, 11:30am to 12:30pm, 5pm to 7pm</li>
