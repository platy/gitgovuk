<h2>Import documents</h2>

<p>To import fish to the UK from another country (excluding EU fish into Northern Ireland), youâ€™ll need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/create-a-uk-catch-certificate">catch certificate</a> validated by the competent authority of the country where the fishing vessel is registered or licensed.</p>

<p>The format of catch certificates will vary depending on which exporting country produced them, but they will all ask for specific information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vessel name</li>
  <li>catch species</li>
  <li>estimated weights</li>
</ul>

<p>For fish that has been stored or processed you may also need the following documents validated by the competent authority:</p>

<ul>
  <li>processing statement filled in by the processor</li>
  <li>documents showing the fish was stored prior to export</li>
</ul>

<p>Port health authorities in Great Britain (England, Scotland or Wales) or fisheries authorities in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> will check these documents for UK freight imports. Fisheries administrations are responsible for checking catch certificates for direct landings into the UK.</p>

<h3>Moving fish from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h3>

<p>Most fish will need no new checks or requirements when moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, as they are considered to be qualifying Northern Ireland goods. The only exceptions are bluefin tuna and Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-qualifying-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-the-rest-of-the-uk" class="govuk-link">moving qualifying goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>UK-registered vessels</h2>

<p>All UK-registered vessels need to meet <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2009/1224/contents">fisheries control regulation requirements</a>.</p>

<h2>Containerised fish imports to the UK</h2>

<p>UK port health authorities will check imports of fish in containers coming into the UK, including fish moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Imports or movements of fish from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-EU/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>/<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> countries to the UK must enter at a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-border-control-posts-animal-and-animal-product-imports" class="govuk-link">border control post</a>
</li>
  <li>EU/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>/<abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> countries to Great Britain do not need to enter at a border control post until January 2022</li>
  <li>Great Britain to Northern Ireland must enter at a designated point of entry in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you import containerised fish, you must submit a catch certificate, processing statement or proof of storage where required, to the relevant port health authority at the following times:</p>

<ul>
  <li>72 hours in advance for imports by sea</li>
  <li>4 hours in advance for imports by rail and air</li>
  <li>2 hours in advance for road</li>
</ul>

<p>If the fish youâ€™re importing or moving has been processed or stored in a country that is not the flag state of the catching vessel you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if stored - get proof of storage from the exporter, validated by the authority in the country where it was stored</li>
  <li>if processed - get a processing statement from the exporter, validated by the authority in the country of processing</li>
</ul>

<p>Imports of fish and shellfish to Great Britain must also be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-notified <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system#notify-about-imports-from-non-eu-countries-including-iceland-to-gb" class="govuk-link">on IPAFFS</a>
</li>
  <li>accompanied by a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/health-certificates-for-animal-and-animal-product-imports-to-great-britain" class="govuk-link">health certificate issued by the country of origin</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Health certificates need to be completed and signed by a qualified certifying officer. For fishery products, this can be a non-veterinary certifying officer, such as a food competent local authority Environmental Health Officer (<abbr title="Environmental Health Officer">EHO</abbr>).</p>

<p>At the point of entry, all goods will be subject to documentary and ID checks and a small proportion of goods will be subject to physical checks.</p>

<p>Imports are also subject to customs formalities including the need to complete a customs import declaration and to pay any applicable duties and VAT.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-full-import-declaration" class="govuk-link">making a full import declaration</a></p>

<p>Imports from the EU to Northern Ireland will be subject to different requirements.</p>

<h2>Moving fish from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>All fish, shellfish and their products being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be pre-notified by the importer on <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tracesnt/login" class="govuk-link" rel="external">TRACES NT</a> in advance of arrival</li>
  <li>enter at a Northern Ireland point of entry</li>
  <li>have an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-export-health-certificate" class="govuk-link">export health certificate (<abbr title="export health certificates">EHC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/create-a-uk-catch-certificate">catch certificate</a> and relevant <abbr title="illegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> documents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Catch certificates for moving fish from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Catch certificates are official documents that prove any marine-caught fish has been caught legally and in line with the regulatory and management measures. UK catch certificates are issued by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and will need to be applied for by the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>-based party.</p>

<p>Traders can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/create-a-uk-catch-certificate" class="govuk-link">create a catch certificate through the online Fish Export Service</a>. Catch certificates checks will be conducted by the Northern Ireland port health authority.</p>

<h3>Approved food establishments</h3>

<p>As with all movements of animal products, establishments will need to be approved in line with food hygiene regulations, either by the relevant local authority or by the Food Standards Agency (or Food Standards Scotland) depending on the nature of the production.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/approved-food-establishments">list of approved food establishments</a>.
These establishments will also need to be listed by the EU.</p>

<h2>Imports from the EU</h2>

<p>Imports to Great Britain from the EU, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and <abbr title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</abbr> are subject to a phased approach.</p>

<p>Importers of most fish and fishery products (as products of animal origin) from the EU need to ensure they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>submit illegal, unreported and unregulated (<abbr title="illegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr>) fishing documents to the port health authority in advance of the consignmentâ€™s arrival</li>
  <li>comply with customs requirements (such as submitting a customs import declaration and paying duties and VAT)</li>
  <li>check that you have correct documents if moving <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr> goods, or goods subject to restrictions (such as bluefin tuna or Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish)</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 October 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-notify the import on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-of-products-animals-food-and-feed-system#notify-about-imports-from-non-eu-countries-including-iceland-to-gb" class="govuk-link">IPAFFS</a> and upload a digital copy of your <abbr title="export health certificates">EHC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>make sure that a certified <abbr title="export health certificates">EHC</abbr> physically accompanies the consignment</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 January 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enter via a point of entry with a border control post</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comply with Rules of Origin for tariff-free trade</h3>

<p>To trade with the EU without paying tariffs all goods need to comply with the preferential Rules of Origin. You need to be able to prove the origin of goods, according to the Product Specific Rules in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rules-of-origin-for-goods-moving-between-the-uk-and-eu" class="govuk-link">HMRC guidance</a> to understand the steps you need to take.</p>

<h2>Direct landings by foreign fishing vessels into the UK</h2>

<p>All foreign fishing vessels landing catch directly into the UK must land into a <a rel="external" href="https://psc.neafc.org/designated-contacts#CYP" class="govuk-link">North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (<abbr title="North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr>) designated port</a> even if landing fish caught outside of the <a rel="external" href="https://www.neafc.org/page/27" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr> convention area</a>.</p>

<p>Foreign vessels catching fish outside of this area will be subject to illegal, unreported and unregulated (<abbr title="illegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr>) checks at the same ports, for purposes of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.fao.org/port-state-measures/en/" rel="external"><abbr title="Food and Agriculture Organisation">FAO</abbr> Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA)</a>.</p>

<p>Foreign vessels that catch fish inside the <abbr title="North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr> convention area and directly land into the UK must submit a <a href="https://psc.neafc.org/welcome" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr> Port State Control form (PSC1)</a> before landing.</p>

<p>Foreign vessels (except for EU vessels landing into Northern Ireland) will also need to complete a:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/give-prior-notification-to-land-fish-in-the-eu" class="govuk-link">prior notification form</a></li>
  <li>pre-landing declaration</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/create-a-uk-catch-certificate" class="govuk-link">catch certificate</a>  (exceptions apply)</li>
</ul>

<p>UK fisheries authorities may inspect the fish you import.</p>

<h3>Prior notification form</h3>

<p>Foreign vessels landing into the UK (except for EU vessels landing into Northern Ireland) will need to complete a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/give-prior-notification-to-land-fish-in-the-eu" class="govuk-link">prior notification form</a> and email it to the designated UK port before landing.</p>

<p>It will need to be sent for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>frozen fish, at least 72 hours before landing</li>
  <li>fresh fish, at least 4 hours before landing</li>
</ul>

<p>Foreign vessels landing into the UK (except for EU vessels landing into Northern Ireland) with fishery products that are exempt from illegal, unreported and unregulated (<abbr title="illegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr>) fishing regulations, will need to complete an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/give-prior-notification-to-land-fish-in-the-eu">exempt fisheries products prior notification form</a></p>

<h3>Pre-landing declaration</h3>

<p>Foreign vessels landing into the UK (except for EU vessels landing into Northern Ireland) will need to fill in a pre-landing declaration and email it to the designated UK port 4 hours before landing. These should be available from your competent authority.</p>

<p>Vessels will need to give details of the consignment, including the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>area fished</li>
  <li>quantity of fish by species on board the vessel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special requirements for EU approved fishing vessels</h3>

<p>Local authority approved freezer, reefer or factory vessels that land frozen or processed fish directly into Great Britain will also require:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a captainâ€™s certificate signed by the captain who is authorised by their competent authority from October 2021</li>
  <li>the fish to be landed into a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-border-control-posts-animal-and-animal-product-imports" class="govuk-link">border control post</a> approved for the landed fishery product from January 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-food approved registered vessels that land fresh fish directly into Great Britain at an <a href="https://psc.neafc.org/designated-contacts#CYP" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission">NEAFC</abbr> designated port</a> will not need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a health certificate</li>
  <li>to pass through a border control post</li>
</ul>

<p>They will still be subject to any normal official controls within the port.</p>

<h2>Direct landings by <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>-flagged fishing vessels into Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>UK-flagged vessels with their port of registration in England, Wales or Scotland landing fresh fishery products (or fish that has undergone primary production such as de-heading) directly into ports in Northern Ireland will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>land into a port designated in line with <abbr title="illegal, unreported and unregulated">IUU</abbr> fishing regulations</li>
  <li>submit a prior notification form and a pre-landing declaration 4 hours in advance of landing taking place</li>
  <li>send a complete and validated catch certificate to the competent authority in Northern Ireland (if applicable to the species of fish being landed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Direct landings (either the vessel or the catch) may be given risk-based checks at the designated port where they land.</p>

<p>There is a separate process for freezer, factory or reefer vessels landing fish that has undergone secondary processing (for example, freezing or wrapping). These vessels will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enter via a designated point of entry in line with sanitary and phytosanitary (<abbr title="sanitary and phytosanitary">SPS</abbr>) regulations</li>
  <li>provide a captainâ€™s certificate signed by the captain who is authorised by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The vessels will need to be approved in line with food hygiene regulations by the relevant local authority and listed by the EU.</p>

<h2>Direct landings by <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>-registered fishing vessels into Northern Ireland</h2>

<p><abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>-registered vessels will only be required to meet pre-existing obligations, such as those contained within the fisheries Control Regulation, when landing into ports in Northern Ireland until further notice. Further discussions in the UK-EU Joint Committee will continue to take place on a range of areas covered in this guidance.</p>

<h2>Re-exporting fish imported from a third country</h2>

<p>If you import fish with a catch certificate and then re-export to the EU, you will need to complete the re-export section of the catch certificate. This does not apply to Northern Ireland to Great Britain or Northern Ireland to EU trade.</p>

<h2>Endangered fish and shellfish</h2>

<p>If you want to import endangered species of fish, follow guidance getting a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cites-imports-and-exports">permit to import endangered species</a>.</p>

<h2>Eels</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#customer-service-centres-csc" class="govuk-link">Contact the <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> Centre for International Trade: Bristol</a> for advice if you plan to import European eels.</p>

<h2>Bluefin tuna and Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish</h2>

<p>Direct landings, imports and exports of bluefin Tuna or Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish into and from the UK (except for movements between Northern Ireland and the EU) will require validated catch documents. These must be submitted to the importing competent authority or relevant fisheries administration, to allow checks to take place.</p>

<p>The movement of these species between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in both directions, will also require the submission of these catch documents.</p>

<h2>Ornamental fish and shellfish and aquaculture</h2>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-or-export-live-fish-and-shellfish" class="govuk-link">guidance on rules you must follow to import live fish or shellfish for ornamental or aquaculture purposes</a>.</p>

<h2>Customs requirements</h2>

<p>You must comply with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cites-imports-and-exports" class="govuk-link">HMRC guidance on customs requirements</a> for importing fishery products into the UK.</p>
