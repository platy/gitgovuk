<p>The UK will leave the EU on 31 October. This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit. It will be updated if anything changes, including if a deal is agreed.</p>

<p>After Brexit, exports of excise goods from the UK to the EU will be treated the same as exports to the rest of the world. This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-and-declaring-excise-goods-in-the-event-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal#place-export">moving excise goods to a place of export in the UK.</a></p>

<h2 id="exporting-excise-duty-paid-goods">Exporting excise duty paid goods</h2>

<p>After Brexit you’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu#export-declarations">submit an electronic export declaration.</a>
If you’re a business, you may be able to recover the excise duty on the exported goods by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-and-declaring-excise-goods-in-the-event-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal#excise-duty-drawback-claims">claiming excise duty drawback.</a></p>

<h2 id="exporting-excise-duty-suspended-goods">Exporting excise duty suspended goods</h2>

<p>After Brexit you cannot use Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) to move excise duty suspended goods from the UK to the EU. If you move goods without following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-declarations-for-goods-taken-out-of-the-eu">relevant customs export procedures</a> at the place they are exported from, you may be liable for excise duty and penalties. Your goods may also be seized.</p>

<p>From 24 October 2019, if you raise a movement on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> to an EU member state with a dispatch date later than 31 October 2019 the movement will be rejected by <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> and HMRC.</p>

<h2 id="moving-excise-duty-suspended-goods-to-the-place-of-export-from-the-uk">Moving excise duty suspended goods to the place of export from the UK</h2>

<p>You must use <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> to move excise duty suspended goods from within the UK to the place they are exported from.</p>

<p>You’ll need to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the authorised warehouse keeper declares the movement on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> when the goods are held in excise duty suspension in their warehouse</li>
  <li>appoint a registered consignor to move the goods or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-and-declaring-excise-goods-in-the-event-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal#reg-con">become a registered consignor</a> - when the goods are being released from a customs control for re-export</li>
</ul>

<p>The authorised warehousekeeper or registered consignor must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete and submit an electronic administrative document (<abbr title="electronic Administrative Document">eAD</abbr>) through <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> before the movement takes place</li>
  <li>get a unique Administrative Reference Code (<abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr>) for that specific movement (that <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> generates)</li>
  <li>complete a customs export declaration using the National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>) and enter the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> in box 40</li>
  <li>receive an ‘accepted for export’ notification on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> after the goods are cleared by customs - if the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> matches the customs export declaration</li>
  <li>receive a ‘report of export’ to ensure the export is closed on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> does not match the customs export declaration within 30 days of the customs export declaration being submitted, the warehousekeeper or registered consignor will receive a ‘rejected for export’ notification to remind them that the movement is still open on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. You’ll need to establish why this has happened and take corrective action.</p>

<h2 id="if-youre-a-registered-excise-business-or-use-authorised-destinations">If you’re a registered excise business or use authorised destinations</h2>

<p>After Brexit, the following registered excise businesses and some authorised destinations will no longer be authorised to receive or dispatch excise goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered consignee (including movements for direct delivery)</li>
  <li>temporary registered consignee</li>
  <li>exempt consignee</li>
  <li>unknown destination for energy products</li>
  <li>tax representative (for excise duty on distance sales from the EU)</li>
  <li>registered commercial importer</li>
  <li>unregistered commercial importers</li>
</ul>

<p>If this impacts your business, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-ready-brexit-check">take steps so that you can continue trading.</a></p>

<h2 id="if-your-goods-are-dispatched-before-brexit-but-received-after-brexit">If your goods are dispatched before Brexit but received after Brexit</h2>

<p>You do not need to complete a UK customs declaration in the UK if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods are travelling under a recognised excise scheme at that time</li>
  <li>you can show that the movement started before Brexit</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirements and any sanctions that may apply to these goods will be based on current UK excise legislation and duty points that apply to EU movements.</p>

<p>HMRC or Border Force may ask for evidence of the date and time your goods were dispatched. You can show this by providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for excise duty suspended goods - the <abbr title="electronic Administrative Document">eAD</abbr> or a commercial document containing the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>for excise duty paid goods, either:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">request to import excise goods bought duty paid in another EU member state</a> (HM4)</li>
      <li>the Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document (<abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr>) form</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot prove the date and time your goods were dispatched, the movement will be treated in the same way as one that started after 31 October 2019 and customs import procedures will apply.</p>

<h3 id="closing-duty-suspended-movements-that-started-before-brexit-but-received-after-brexit">Closing duty suspended movements that started before Brexit but received after Brexit</h3>

<p>If your goods arrive in the EU after Brexit but were dispatched from the UK before this time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you cannot use <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> to create reports of receipt</li>
  <li>the movement will remain open in the system</li>
  <li>you’ll need to provide an alternative proof of receipt</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not receive an endorsed copy of the <abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr> back from the EU business for excise duty paid goods, you’ll need to provide an alternative proof of receipt.</p>

<h3 id="excise-duty-drawback-claims">Excise duty drawback claims</h3>

<p>If you provide HMRC with an EX75 Notice of Intention (NOI) before 31 October 2019  but the drawback claim is made after this date, the way you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback">claim duty drawback</a> will change. HMRC will provide more information about these changes before a no-deal Brexit.</p>
