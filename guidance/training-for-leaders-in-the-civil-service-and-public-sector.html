<p>The Government Campus is bringing together all of our programmes in the new Leadership College for Government.</p>

<p>We offer training for Civil Service and public sector leaders at different stages of their career, at our physical Government Campus locations, with partners across the UK, and virtually through online modules and events. Our offers aim to better prepare our public leaders and managers with the skills, knowledge and networks they need to serve their communities.</p>

<p>There are many options for leadership development, in and outside the Civil Service. We are mapping programmes across government departments, the wider public sector, and external providers. This will help you make an informed choice to pick the opportunity that is best for your career and the needs of your organisation.</p>

<p>The support offered by the Leadership College for Government is described below. You can also read about these programmes and courses in more detail in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/leading-to-deliver-a-leadership-and-management-prospectus">Leading to Deliver: A Leadership and Management Prospectus</a>.</p>

<h2>Managers at all levels</h2>

<p>There are 4 new programmes for managers at all levels of the Civil Service.</p>

<h3>Foundation</h3>

<p>This programme will be available for any civil servant new to management. It will be a modular programme, including peer-to-peer learning and networking opportunities.</p>

<h3>Personal Effectiveness</h3>

<p>This programme will focus on accountability in role rather than line management responsibility. Following the training, you will be able to deliver against personal and team objectives using relevant policies, systems and procedures. You will be able to support a senior team in achieving organisational goals.</p>

<h3>Practitioner</h3>

<p>The Practitioner programme will focus on the more challenging aspects of leading and managing. Modules include strategy, technology, data, and communicating change with authenticity.</p>

<h3>Senior Practitioner</h3>

<p>The Senior Practitioner programme will focus on the complexities of being a leader and manager with a large number of people reporting to you and your teams. You will be able to describe the systems-thinking required to balance the strategic needs of your business unit with the broader needs of the agency or department. This skill will help you to deliver complex objectives.</p>

<h3>Who the courses are for</h3>

<p>These 4 courses are not specific to a certain grade level. Each one provides skills and knowledge needed for challenges you will face at different points in your career.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a grade 7 policy officer who is new to line management could benefit from the Foundation level</li>
  <li>an executive officer who is an experienced line manager could choose to top up their skills at the Practitioner level</li>
  <li>a new entrant senior executive officer with no line management responsibility would be directed to Personal Effectiveness courses to start their leadership journey</li>
</ul>

<p>These programmes will be piloted from spring 2022, starting with the foundation programme. All 4 will be available to all civil servants by spring 2023.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://cabinetoffice.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cca5034f3c5b7f68f7b2bea00&amp;id=1eb0626b43" rel="external">Subscribe to the Campus News newsletter</a> for alerts on when these programmes are open for applications.</p>

<h2>Grade 6 and grade 7 development</h2>

<p>The Future Leaders Scheme is cross-government accelerated development training for around 400 high potential grade 6 or 7 civil servants. As part of the Future Leaders Scheme, we also offer the Minority Ethnic Talent Association (META) programme to successful candidates from ethnic minority backgrounds and the Disability Empowers Leadership Talent (DELTA) programme to those with a disability or long-term health condition.</p>

<p>These programmes can help you accelerate your learning and build your personal leadership effectiveness. They will develop the skills, knowledge and networks you need to serve others in modern government and find fulfilment in your careers.</p>

<h2>Senior Civil Service induction and Civil Service orientation</h2>

<p>We offer 3 activities for new senior civil servants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Civil Service orientation for external Senior Civil Service (<abbr title="Senior Civil Service">SCS</abbr>) hires</li>
  <li>Deputy Director (SCS1) induction</li>
  <li>Director (SCS2) induction</li>
</ul>

<p>New colleagues joining from outside the Civil Service can attend a Civil Service orientation, before taking a place on a more specific induction with their new director or deputy director peers. We expect to induct around 400 newly appointed directors and deputy directors a year.</p>

<p>Internally promoted senior civil servants will be able to go straight onto their grade-specific induction in cohorts of up to 20 participants.</p>

<h3>Induction programme structure</h3>

<p>The new approach will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a virtual launch event</li>
  <li>online modules at times to suit participants, delivered on a digital platform called FutureLearn</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="Senior Civil Service">SCS</abbr> buddy from your preference of profession or organisation</li>
  <li>a residential face-to-face workshop</li>
</ul>

<p>Every induction closes with a residential face-to-face event. You will meet peers and have development sessions that work best in person, such as group conversations to work on key strategic priorities.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/learning-events-calendar">Book a place on an upcoming induction</a>.</p>

<h2>Deputy director development</h2>

<p>The Senior Leaders Scheme is the cross-government accelerated development training for deputy directors (SCS1) with the aspiration and potential to reach the highest levels in the Civil Service.</p>

<p>The training will accelerate your learning and develop your leadership effectiveness as part of a cohort of high-potential civil servants from across government.</p>

<p>It includes formal learning and selfÂ­-led development and consolidation, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>workshops on developmental, system, collaborative, and adaptive leadership</li>
  <li>executive coaching and action learning sets</li>
  <li>modules on priority capability areas</li>
  <li>participant-Â­led learning, where participants share their knowledge and expertise with fellow scheme members
learning trips to external organisations</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://cabinetoffice.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cca5034f3c5b7f68f7b2bea00&amp;id=1eb0626b43" rel="external">Subscribe to the Campus News newsletter</a> for alerts on the Senior Leaders Scheme.</p>

<h2>Director development</h2>

<p>A new selective one year programme is being designed for talented Civil Service directors and some public sector leaders. It will reflect international best practice in executive education, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>case method: an approach that role plays scenarios where attendees need to make critical decisions</li>
  <li>a focus on skills and knowledge needed to effectively deliver in modern government</li>
  <li>deep peer networks across the Civil Service and the wider public sector</li>
</ul>

<p>The new programme will replace the High Potential Development Scheme. More information and an update on an application process will be provided in summer 2022.</p>

<p>Directors are also now welcomed to the events and activities for public sector leaders, as highlighted below.</p>

<h2>Director general and above</h2>

<p>The Civil Service Leadership Group brings together civil servants at the most senior levels â€” permanent secretaries, directors general, and equivalent roles â€” to work together on strategic issues and government priorities. The group is regularly invited to calls, webinars, events and visits.</p>

<p>If you are a new, recently promoted, or interim director general and are not receiving notifications about these events, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:leadershipcollege@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">leadershipcollege@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Directors general and permanent secretaries are also included in the public sector offer for <abbr title="chief executive officers">CEOs</abbr>, where they can build universally applicable skills and deep networks with colleagues across the wider public sector.</p>

<h2>Public sector leaders</h2>

<p>We have a wide ranging offer for senior public sector leaders at <abbr title="chief executive">CEO</abbr> and deputy <abbr title="chief executive">CEO</abbr> level. We provide topical events, peer shadowing and opportunities to make connections in small groups, and through leadership programmes.</p>

<p>We welcome senior leaders from across the public sector, including health, education, police, fire and rescue, armed forces, and local and central government.</p>

<p>As the Leadership College for Governmentâ€™s offer evolves, we will promote specific opportunities in partnership with other public sector leadership academies and sector organisations.</p>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>You can sign up for in-person and online events and networking opportunities for senior leaders across the public sector. These events focus on specific knowledge and skills development on a wide range of topics.</p>

<h3>Leadership programmes</h3>

<p>In 2022, we have cohorts taking part in 3 programmes addressing specific leadership needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Public Leaders Programme, which supports new <abbr title="chief executive officers">CEOs</abbr> stepping up to this level</li>
  <li>the Accelerate Programme, for ethnic minority leaders at deputy <abbr title="chief executive">CEO</abbr>-level who aim to become <abbr title="chief executive officers">CEOs</abbr> in their fields</li>
  <li>the Catalyst Programme, for deputy <abbr title="chief executive">CEO</abbr>-level leaders with a disability or long-term health condition who are aiming to become <abbr title="chief executive officers">CEOs</abbr> within their respective fields</li>
</ul>

<p>Our offer, bringing civil servants and wider public sector leaders together, regularly evolves to take on board feedback from leaders and partners. More details about events, connections and programmes will be shared later in the spring.</p>
