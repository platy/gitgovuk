<p>The National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSbS) refresh builds on the commitments of the previous strategy and reaffirms the need for the shipbuilding industry to work together to understand and articulate their future skills needs.</p>

<p>In response, the Department for Education (DfE) will work with the National Shipbuilding Office (NSO) to establish a UK Shipbuilding Skills Taskforce (UKSST). The Taskforce will form a partnership between government, industry, training providers and trade representative bodies. We anticipate it will be launched by summer 2022.  </p>

<h2>What the Taskforce will do</h2>
<p>The Taskforce will support the development and implementation of a future-focused skills strategy for shipbuilding. Working closely with the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Department for Transport (DfT), it will build a picture of the industry’s skills needs and provide solutions to skills shortages, particularly those related to new and emerging technologies.  </p>

<p>By catalysing and leveraging the skills system, the Taskforce will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure providers are empowered to meet the industry’s requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work with industry colleagues to promote varied and exciting career opportunities in the shipbuilding sector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>draw on the best practice internationally and from other sectors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>optimise the available skills funding and opportunities for shipbuilding</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Join the Taskforce</h2>

<p>We are recruiting a Chair and members of the Taskforce for the duration of its lifecycle (approximately 18 months).  </p>

<p>We are looking for individuals: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>with experience in, and a passion for, shipbuilding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who are optimistic about the growth of UK shipbuilding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>with ideas about how to ensure a strong skills pipeline to achieve the ambition for a renaissance in UK shipbuilding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who will represent their organisations from a variety of areas within the sector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>from across all parts of the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who know the skills required in the sector and the ways to develop them  for example, through education courses or apprenticeships  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who have a membership of a professional body/network within the industry </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who have a large reach within the industry</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We are also keen to have representatives from training providers and industry trade bodies. Including larger and smaller shipyards, boat builders, the shipbuilding supply chain, as well as other areas of the sector including leisure, design, consultancy and sub-systems.</p>

<h3>Chair </h3>

<p>In addition to the above, it is preferred that candidates for this role have experience in leading a group of this nature to discuss issues and reach agreement on key topics. </p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/r/MZ6JeCJxkV" rel="external">Applications for the role of Chair</a> will close at 11:55pm on Sunday, 3 April 2022.  </p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/r/MZ6JeCJxkV" rel="external">Applications for members</a> will close at 11:55pm on Sunday, 17 April 2022.   
 
The roles will be voluntary and ideally, members will represent different job roles and areas from within the industry to bring a range of views and experience. We will also consider diversity when selecting members.</p>

<h2>What will Taskforce members do?</h2>
<p>Members will be expected to: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>share their experience, knowledge and skills to inform the work and the strategy of the Taskforce </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>share ideas and best practice to build a strong skills pipeline for the industry, ensuring programmes across nations are effective</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>represent the views and experiences of their organisation in discussions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use their networks to gather and share information  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>participate in regular meetings of the Taskforce </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use their networks to support the implementation of the Taskforce’s outputs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support communications activity in promoting shipbuilding careers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>commit up to 2 days per month for Taskforce activities; this will include attending regular meetings and preparation time (for example reading papers and engaging with their networks)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, the Chair’s role will include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>chairing all Taskforce meetings, leading discussions, ensuring all members have an opportunity to share perspectives, and driving the group to reach consensus when making decisions </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>working with the secretariat to inform agenda setting and other activities outside of meetings of the Taskforce  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attending the Maritime Skills Commission (MSC) and Shipbuilding Enterprise for Growth (SEG) meetings to represent the Taskforce, to ensure alignment with these groups, and feedback on work being done in this area  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>working alongside the DfE and Devolved Administration leads to provide overall strategic leadership for the Taskforce, ensuring activities align with the priorities in the Shipbuilding Strategy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attending wider governance meetings on occasion, for example, with the NSO</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Chair would be expected to commit up to 3 days per month. This will also include attending meetings to represent the Taskforce, and providing updates about, and to, the Taskforce.</p>

<p>DfE will sift applications alongside colleagues from the Devolved Administrations, and with input from the National Shipbuilding Office . We aim to contact the successful chair by early May 2022 and will seek their input on membership decisions. We will contact successful members in May 2022, and the first meeting of the Taskforce will take place in early summer 2022.</p>

<p>We are also building a broader pool of people interested in being consulted on the work of the Taskforce in future.
