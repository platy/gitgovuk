<h2>Book and plan your visit to Isis</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<h2>Book and plan your visit to Isis</h2>
<p>To visit someone in Isis you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-isis">required ID</a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit. With each visiting order, 3 adults (aged 10 and over) and 3 children (aged 9 and under) can visit.</p>

<p>Prisoners can have 2 or  3 visits a month, depending on ‘privileges’.</p>

<h3>Help with the cost of your visit</h3>
<p>If you get certain benefits or have an NHS health certificate, you might be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help-with-prison-visits">get help with the costs of your visit</a>, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travel to Isis</li>
  <li>somewhere to stay overnight</li>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>Isis aims to provide 4 family days a year: Easter, Summer Holidays, October half-term and Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>These will be divided by one family visit per residential unit.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Isis</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Isis.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms so they are able to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Isis using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Isis.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Isis</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Isis are given a list of approved items that can be sent to them as gifts. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Isis</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>In the first 28 days, men can apply to get a clothing parcel handed in. They can apply for another after 6 months. Parcels can be handed in at visits.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
