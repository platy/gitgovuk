<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days available.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Isis</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Isis.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms so they are able to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Isis using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Isis.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Isis</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Isis are given a list of approved items that can be sent to them as gifts. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Isis</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>In the first 28 days, men can apply to get a clothing parcel handed in. They can apply for another after 6 months. Parcels can be handed in at visits.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
