<h2>General principles</h2>

<p>Operators should consider this guidance alongside general guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">working safely during coronavirus in England</a>at the airport</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/keep-wales-safe-work" rel="external">working safely during coronavirus in Wales</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-returning-to-work/" rel="external">working safely during coronavirus in Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/coronavirus-workplace-safety-guidance-and-priority-sector-list-published" rel="external">working safely during coronavirus in Northern Ireland</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Where these routine measures are not possible, carry out a <a class="govuk-link" href="#risk-ass">risk assessment</a> and adopt additional measures.</p>

<h3>Applicability of the suggested measures</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> aviation sector has a diverse range of airports, aircraft, routes and operations. This guidance addresses commercial passenger and freight aviation, business aviation, and some aspects of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-general-aviation/coronavirus-covid-19-general-aviation">general aviation</a>. It is up to each organisation to arrive at a suitable risk control strategy.â€¯</p>

<h3>Public health authorities</h3>

<p>This guidance applies to all countries of the United Kingdom.  Aviation operators in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should also refer to the health advice from the relevant public health authority:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" rel="external">Welsh Government</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19" rel="external">NHS Scotland</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/COVID-19-coronavirus" rel="external">Northern Ireland Public Health Agency</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-COVID-19" rel="external"><abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> Direct</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Freight</h3>

<p>Cargo operators and airports should consider how the measures set out in this document should be applied, where relevant, to cargo and freight flights.</p>

<h3>General and business aviation</h3>

<p>The measures set out in this document should be applied, where relevant, to general and business aviation. Consider the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-general-aviation/coronavirus-covid-19-general-aviation">guidance for general aviation</a>.</p>

<h3>Staff roles in airports and on board aircraft</h3>

<p>This guidance applies to all workers in the aviation industry. Workers include and are not limited to aircrew and flight crew, ground crew, retail staff, baggage handlers, maintenance engineers, shuttle / bus drivers, security staff, cleaners, catering company workers and workers who assist passengers with reduced mobility or disabilities. Consider the full range of activities and how to manage the risks arising from these roles.</p>

<h2>National transport operator guidance</h2>

<p>There is also separate multimodal transport operator guidance containing relevant information for aviation operators.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Passenger responsibility</h2>

<p>All operators (airports, airlines, travel companies, other service providers) are responsible for clear health and safety communications with workers and passengers at the <a class="govuk-link" href="#pass-journey">appropriate points in their journey</a>.</p>

<p>Communications should reinforce passengersâ€™ personal responsibility for the safety of themselves and others. Operators should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how passengers can be informed of what measures are in place and why</li>
  <li>what guidance should be given to passengers on expected behaviours</li>
</ul>

<p>There is separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-air-travel-guidance-for-passengers">guidance for passengers travelling by air and in airports</a>.</p>

<h2>Risk assessments</h2>

<p>A risk assessment helps organisations identify sensible measures to control or manage the risks in workplaces and the services you provide. There are various types of risk assessment to control different types of risks. This guidance relates to health and safety risk assessments to manage the risks of coronavirus transmission.</p>

<p>Use this guide to ensure that your risk assessment addresses the risks of coronavirus and incorporates decisions and control measures suitable for the aviation industry. This aviation guidance sets out what the employer should be doing to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/lwit/assets/downloads/hierarchy-risk-controls.pdf" rel="external">control risk in a prioritised way</a> and what staff should be doing to cooperate with their employer and to safeguard themselves and others.â€¯ There is more general guidance to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">help employers, employees and the self-employed understand how to work safely during the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>All existing non-coronavirus related health and safety requirements continue to apply. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/assessment.htm" rel="external">Health and Safety Executive</a> and other transport regulators can help you comply with health and safety legislation.</p>

<p>Review your risk assessment regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and appropriate under changing circumstances. Risk assessments should take account of other risks and ensure controls implemented for coronavirus do not increase risks due to other hazards.</p>

<p>Employers have a legal duty to consult employees and unions on health and safety. Workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks, and in the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employees should be encouraged to identify, speak up, and provide feedback on risks and control measures.</p>

<p>We recommend you consider the following when conducting a coronavirus risk assessment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>risks to workers, passengers, customers, and the public, along with the control measures required</li>
  <li>the impact of control measures and whether they result in additional, different risks or non-compliance with other requirements (for example health and safety or equalities legislation)</li>
  <li>applying the hierarchy of controls set out in the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to control risk in a prioritised way</li>
  <li>consultation with workers, or bodies representing workers, and the public</li>
  <li>the visibility of the results of any risk assessment</li>
  <li>service providers have duties towards individuals with protected characteristics</li>
  <li>transport networks should be accessible to everyone</li>
  <li>individuals should be supported to comply with social distancing rules where these apply (in airports between disembarkation and border control)</li>
  <li>all equality and discrimination laws continue to apply</li>
  <li>organisations need to ensure that the actions taken as a result of the assessment do not disproportionately impact those with protected characteristics</li>
  <li>consideration should also be given to other groups needing additional support to travel safely, such as minors and vulnerable people</li>
</ul>

<p>The airport, aircraft operator or other relevant parties need to conduct risk assessments to determine what the risks are and how to go about risk control.â€¯Risks should be reduced to the lowest reasonably practical level by taking preventative measures in order of priority.</p>

<p>In the following order of priority, risks should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminated</li>
  <li>controlled through substituting materials or processes with less hazardous ones</li>
  <li>controlled through engineering means</li>
  <li>controlled through identifying and implementing procedures</li>
  <li>controlled through using individual protective measures such as gloves and face masks if all other measures have been implemented and residual risk remains</li>
</ul>

<p>In line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/lwit/assets/downloads/hierarchy-risk-controls.pdf" rel="external">HSE guidance</a>, it is important to follow this order of priority rather than simply jump to what may seem the easiest control measure to implement.</p>

<p>If your risk assessment shows that personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) is required, then you must provide this <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> free of charge to workers who need it. Any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided must fit properly. This document includes specific guidance on measures for security staff in aviation.</p>

<p>Risk assessments should consider communication with passengers, where relevant, making it as straightforward as possible for passengers to comply with measures, and giving passengers and the wider public the information they need to have confidence in the public health measures implemented in the aviation sector.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the obligations to provide assistance to disabled people and people with reduced mobility, as set out in Regulation (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) 1107/2006, remain in place. Guidance to both airports and airlines on the provision of special assistance has been produced by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.caa.co.uk/Our-work/Newsroom/COVID-19-guidance-for-commercial-and-recreational-aviation/" rel="external"><abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr></a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ecac-ceac.org/documents/10189/40787/Code_of_Conduct_Ground_Handling_PRM-2003.pdf/5f1c3c20-bbdc-474c-add2-6755636de996" rel="external"><abbr title="European Civil Aviation Conference">ECAC</abbr></a>. Organisations need to ensure that actions taken to control risks of coronavirus transmission do not disproportionately impact those with protected characteristics.</p>

<h2>Who should be at work</h2>

<p>Employers should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">Working safely guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Employers should remain responsive to workersâ€™ needs, especially with regard to scheduling vaccinations or booster doses. Employers should adopt practices that help to reduce the risks to individuals in the workplace.</p>

<h2>Social distancing</h2>

<p>Different rules and guidance on social distancing in workplaces apply in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Read more about:</p>

</ul>

<p>The police have powers to enforce these legal limits.</p>

<h2>Hand washing</h2>

<p>Washing hands is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission and the aviation industry is encouraged to consider how it can facilitate hand washing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>hand washing is relevant to both employees and passengers</li>
  <li>consider the use of hand sanitiser for circumstances in which it is difficult to wash hands (for example before boarding or disembarking from an aircraft)</li>
  <li>consider ways for people to avoid touching surfaces before and after washing hands (for example, through non-touch sensors for doors and taps)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Respiratory hygiene</h2>

<p>Encourage passengers to avoid touching their faces and to cough or sneeze into a tissue, or into their arm if a tissue is not available. Assist passengers to dispose of used tissues safely.</p>

<h2>Fixed teams and partnering</h2>

<p>Consider organising work so that employees work in groups that are as small as possible (cohorting) with minimal mixing between groups. For example, consider keeping maintenance teams working together, rather than mixing team members on different shifts.</p>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>In England,â€¯there is no legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you wear a face-covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you mayâ€¯come into contact withâ€¯other people you do not normally meet.â€¯</p>

<p>Operators are free to set their own conditions of carriage.</p>

<p>There may be different rules in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Read more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-face-coverings" rel="external">face coverings in Northern Ireland</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public" rel="external">face coverings in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some people donâ€™t have to, or shouldnâ€™t be expected to, wear a face covering, for reasons of health, age or equality. See more information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-face-coverings" rel="external">people who donâ€™t have to wear a face covering in Northern Ireland</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public#section-52204" rel="external">people who donâ€™t have to wear a face covering in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>People who are not required or expected to wear a face covering may choose to use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">cards or badges</a> such as those produced by government or by some operators. It is important to be aware that there is no requirement to do this, and some people may choose not to.</p>

<p>If a face covering is worn, it is important toâ€¯<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#how-to-wear-a-face-covering">use face coverings properly</a> and to wash hands before and after putting them on and taking them off. Store face coverings hygienically when not in use.</p>

<p>Encourage passengers to bring spare face coverings for longer journeys and plastic bags to store used face coverings. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a supply of spare face coverings in airports and on aircraft</li>
  <li>providing extra â€˜black bagâ€™ waste bins or litter bins for customers to throw away face coverings â€“ staff and passengers should not use a recycling bin</li>
</ul>

<p>A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of workplace <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. These should be reserved for people who need to wear them at work, such as health and care workers. See the guidance on risk control measures at security checkpoints.</p>

<p>Some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">international destinations may require different face coverings or masks to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Please be mindful that the wearing of a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

<h3>Face coverings â€“ travelling to the airport</h3>

<p>Face coverings are not legally required on public transport in England.</p>

<p>Operators are free to set their own requirements for wearing face coverings. Passengers should check with their service operator before travelling:</p>

<ul>

<p>See also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control">general guidance on entering the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Direct passengers to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">safer travel guidance</a> to plan their journey to or from the airport. Advise passengers on the relevant health and safety measures in place such as washing their hands frequently, face coverings, avoiding touching surfaces and facing away from others.</p>

<h3>Symptomatic passengers â€“ prior to check in</h3>

<p>Airlines should consider how to encourage symptomatic passengers not to go to the airport. Consider customer communications, incentives such as flexible booking options and passenger rights regarding refunds or rebooking if they choose not to travel due to coronavirus symptoms.</p>

<h2>Online check-in</h2>

<p>Where possible, check-in should be managed online and prior to arrival at the airport to avoid face-to-face contact at the airport.</p>

<p>Consider using prominent messaging on airline websites, email, <abbr title="short message service">SMS</abbr>, via travel agents, and any other suitable customer contact platform.</p>

<p>In line with other medical conditions, airlines have the right to refuse travel to anyone they believe is not fit to fly.</p>

<h3>For aviation employees</h3>

<p>Airlines, airports and service providers should consider similar declarations from their employees within their own health monitoring programmes and under existing employment contracts. Put in place protocols to remove staff with coronavirus symptoms from duties as quickly as possible.  For ground-based staff the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/workers/employers.htm" rel="external">standard government guidance in relation to employer duty of care</a> applies.</p>

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>All operators (airports, airlines, travel companies, other service providers) are responsible for clear health and safety communications with passengers at the appropriate point in their journey.</p>

<p>Design communications to reinforce passengersâ€™ personal responsibility for safety of themselves and others. Consider how passengers can be informed of what new measures are in place and why, and what guidance should be given to passengers regarding expected behaviours.</p>

<p>Airlines, travel agents, and tour operators should provide passengers with clear communications, guidance and information ahead of their flight. The messaging should be simple, clear and accessible with consideration of groups whose first language may not be English and those with disabilities.  Topics can include how far in advance passengers should arrive, cleaning regimes, and staff and passenger welfare. Passengers should be clear what to expect at the airport and on the flight, and what they need to do to prepare.</p>

<p>Communications should be clear that good hygiene remains the most important thing, face coverings are required or recommended in airports and on aircraft, and that social distancing rules may be enforced in certain places.</p>

<p>To ease congestion during boarding and disembarkation, airlines should strongly promote the carriage of baggage in the aircraft hold and minimise any hand/ cabin baggage through communication and incentive policies. Face coverings and adequate personal supplies may need to be catered for. Existing safety protocols on baggage (including lithium batteries) continue to apply.</p>

<h2>Travelling to the airport</h2>

<p>Encourage passengers to book their travel to the airport online in advance and follow the relevant safer travel guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">safer travel in England</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/safer-travel-guidance-public-transport-users-walkers-cyclists-drivers" rel="external">safer travel in Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19" rel="external">safer travel in Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/travel-and-transport-advice" rel="external">safer travel in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Operators should coordinate and communicate timetable / schedule changes to passengers so they can plan their journey to the airport.</p>

<p>Consider how to communicate to passengers the time it will take to progress through the airport with public health measures in place. Allow enough time for passengers to make their flight while keeping the time they spend at the airport to a minimum.</p>

<h2>At the airport</h2>

<p>Where possible, airports should help passengers navigate the airport safely. For example, through one-way flows, signage at drop-off point, lifts from car park to terminals, and so on. Where possible, design passenger flows to minimise queues and crowds as these create coronavirus transmission risks and potential security vulnerabilities.</p>

<h3>Airport cleaning</h3>

<p>Cleaning is vital in all areas of the airport and aircraft. Aircraft and airport operators should write and implement a cleaning plan and update it when new information becomes available. Follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings"><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> public health cleaning guidance</a>. Regularly clean surfaces thoroughly using standard detergents. Regularly review the frequency of cleaning based on traffic.</p>

<p>Regularly clean all frequently touched surfaces. For example, door handles, banister rails, buttons, luggage trolley handles, and toilet areas. Maintain air conditioning systems properly. Consider installation of touch-free equipment in toilet facilities such doors, taps and soap dispensers.</p>

<p>Perform cleaning activities in ways that do not aerosolise particles set on surfaces. For example, avoid air blowing procedures and the use of vacuum cleaners. Ensure a full risk assessment is in place for cleaning staff, consistent with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">general advice on workplace cleaning</a>. Consider local communications to staff and passengers on cleaning frequency and protocols.</p>

<p>Make hand washing facilities and/or hand sanitiser available at airports. Use the risk assessment to determine where these should be placed. Consider entrances, exits, before and after security, areas where food and drink may be consumed, staff areas, and commonly touched surfaces.</p>

<h3>Symptomatic passengers â€“ at the airport</h3>

<p>In line with other medical conditions, airlines have the right to refuse travel to anyone they believe is not fit to fly. Aircraft operators should use existing powers, including conditions of carriage, for this.</p>

<p>If anyone becomes unwell in an airport with the symptoms of coronavirus they should be advised to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">follow public health advice</a>.</p>

<p>Agree pathways to manage suspected coronavirus cases at each airport. The <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Health Control Unit or equivalent for devolved administrationsâ€¯can advise on isolating and managing passengers with symptoms.</p>

<p>If individuals need clinical advice, they should go online toâ€¯NHS 111, or call 111 if they donâ€™t have internet access:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://111.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS111 in England</a>.</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://111.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS111 in Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ask.nhsinform.scot/" rel="external">NHS inform in Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://111.wales.nhs.uk/SelfAssessments/symptomcheckers/COVID19.aspx" rel="external">NHS111 in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In an emergency, call 999 if an individual is seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. Do not visit theâ€¯GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital.</p>

<p>Unless you are directly advised by the local public health authorities, there is currently no requirement to self-isolate if you have been near to someone showing coronavirus symptoms in the workplace and have been following the measures agreed in the risk assessment. Workers should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell.  It is not necessary to close the transport setting or send any staff home. It is part of the risk assessment process for airport operators to determine measures to protect staff in this scenario.</p>

<h3>Ventilation</h3>

<p>Consider ventilation and air flow in airports. Where possible, ensure that there is a consistently flowing fresh air supply. Fresh air ventilation systems can operate as normal but recirculating air systems may require adjustments to increase fresh air flow.</p>

<h3>Passenger flows</h3>

<p>Minimise face-to-face contact between check-in staff and passengers by promoting online check-in, introducing measures to assist passengers using self-service check-in, and (where feasible) providing self-service check-in terminals and bag drop.</p>

<p>Where face-to-face contact is unavoidable, consider protective measures such as screens. These should allow the handover of the required documentation but provide protection for both staff and passengers. Consider introducing protocols where possible to limit contact with documentation, for example checking electronically.</p>

<p>Consider the frequency of cleaning for commonly touched items such as self-service check-in terminals to minimise the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>Where queues may form, consider floor markings, signage, announcements, space requirements, ventilation and staffing. Where queues are unavoidable, undertake a security risk assessment and share with appropriate stakeholders.</p>

<p>Display health and safety promotion materials, particularly in waiting areas and high passenger flow areas. For example, at entrances, gates, lounges and on information screens. Use simple, clear and accessible messaging to explain guidelines, with consideration of groups whose first language may not be English and people with disabilities.</p>

<p>Encourage passengers, where possible, not to touch surfaces in the airport. Frequently touched surfaces, such as self-service check-in terminals, luggage trolley handles and automated gates, should be cleaned regularly following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Use standard detergents and cleaning products or 70% isopropyl alcohol (<abbr title="isopropyl alcohol">IPA</abbr>). Airport and aircraft operators should consider providing hand sanitiser or suitable wipes where needed. They should also address the safe collection and disposal of used wipes and additional waste.</p>

<p>Make hand washing facilities or, where that is not possible, hand sanitiser available to passengers and staff.</p>

<h3>Temperature screening</h3>

<p>The current scientific evidence does not support temperature screening as an effective method to screen passengers for coronavirus. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> advice is that there should be no requirement for temperature screening before passengers fly to, enter, depart from, or fly within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Airports or aircraft operators may decide to introduce temperature screening as part of a package of measures to increase passenger confidence, or where destinations outside the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> have mandated temperature screening before departure. When serving countries which require temperature screening, operators may decide for operational reasons to also implement screening for passengers travelling to other destinations.</p>

<p>If implementing temperature screening, airports and aircraft operators should work together to consider how best to do so. Airlines and airports implementing the system should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the effective training and safety of staff conducting temperature testing</li>
  <li>concept of operations</li>
  <li>calibration of devices</li>
  <li>passenger flows</li>
  <li>passenger assistance</li>
  <li>data protection legislation</li>
</ul>

<p>Give attention to pathways for passengers who fail screening, including the possibility of false positive and false negative results.</p>

<h2>At the security checkpoint</h2>

<p>Airport operators should identify and control transmission risks at security checkpoints.</p>

<p>Give clear information and guidance to passengers at security checkpoints. Encourage passengers to prepare for security checks in a way that will minimise the need for manual searches.</p>

<p>Undertake a health and safety risk assessment of security checkpoints to determine the safest way to appropriately manage any health risk. Consider screens, processes, working practices and use of technology to control the risk of transmission through being near to others and handling common items such as screening trays.</p>

<p>Consider <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements for security officers, as determined by the risk assessment. It is recommended to ask passengers if they have any recognised symptoms of coronavirus before security searches, wear gloves for each search and wash hands as frequently as possible.</p>

<p>Use signage and floor markings to prevent queues forming. Consider the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators#queues-and-protecting-passenger-flows">guidance for queues and crowd management</a>.</p>

<p>Consider making hand sanitiser available for passengers at the start and end of the security checkpoint. Carry out a risk assessment of the security checkpoint to determine where to place hand sanitiser.</p>

<h2>At the departure lounge/ terminal airside area/ arrival areas</h2>

<h3>Retailers</h3>

<p>Retailers throughout airports should follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/shops-and-branches">government guidance for retail</a>. Encourage retailers, where possible, to use self-service options, and operate a one-way system, in coordination with measures taken throughout the airport.</p>

<p>Retailers should be cashless wherever possible. Airports and retailers should work together to minimise any risks arising from the consumption of essential food and drink, including opening additional seating areas where possible.</p>

<p>There are different rules about social contact in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Read more about:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/guidance-leaving-your-home-and-seeing-other-people-coronavirus" rel="external">social contact rules in Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Transit between terminals</h3>

<p>Where airports have passenger transit systems (including Gatwick and Stansted) operators should consider the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators">multi-modal guidance for transport operators</a>. Carry out a risk assessment to identify suitable measures to lower the risk of transmission. For example, increasing the number of transits, providing hand sanitiser, and reviewing cleaning schedules. Advise passengers that they may need extra time to travel between terminals.</p>

<h2>At the departure gate</h2>

<p>Subject to infrastructure or operational constraints, implement measures in waiting areas and  at departure gates  to prevent queues forming. For example, consider one-way passenger flows, floor markings and signage. Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators#queues-and-protecting-passenger-flows">guidance for queues and crowd management</a>.</p>

<p>Consider installing screens (subject to risk assessment) to protect the staff who are viewing passports and boarding passes. Consider introducing protocols to allow staff to view and not touch passports and boarding passes. Make hand washing facilities or hand sanitiser available. Carry out a risk assessment of the departure gate to determine where to place these.</p>

<h2>Embarkation and disembarkation</h2>

<p>Operators should consider any changes required in their risk assessment, for example increased frequency of buses. Consider the safety of bus drivers and other staff helping passengers board, and put appropriate measures in place. Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators">guidance for multi-modal transport operators</a>.</p>

<p>Airlines should consider boarding and disembarking passengers in ways that control the risk of transmission. Take into account the loading and layout of aircraft, facilities available at the gate, and the requirements of passengers with protected characteristics.</p>

<p>Clean and disinfect terminal infrastructure and all equipment regularly. Increase the frequency of cleaning as required due to traffic and use.</p>

<h2>On board aircraft</h2>

<p>Measures to manage the risk of transmission on board aircraft will vary depending on the size of the vehicle, passenger load and cabin configuration.</p>

<p>Airlines may require passengers to wear a face covering under conditions of carriage.</p>

<p>Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seat allocations</li>
  <li>passengers not facing each other</li>
  <li>ventilation</li>
  <li>reduced movement of passengers within aircraft</li>
  <li>reduced interaction between passengers and aircrew</li>
  <li>processes for isolation of symptomatic passengers</li>
  <li>pre-sealed and pre-prepared food and drink</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible, airlines should inform passengers in advance on the measures being taken to minimise the risk of transmission on flights. Consider sharing information on seat layouts and planned load factors so passengers can make informed decisions on booking and before check-in.</p>

<h3>Cleaning of aircraft</h3>

<p>Review cleaning protocols to limit coronavirus transmission. Include who will carry out cleaning activity and risk controls for individuals undertaking cleaning. Also consider the detailed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/EASA-ECDC_COVID-19_Operational%20guidelines%20for%20management%20of%20passengers_final.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union Aviation Safety Agency">EASA</abbr></a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icao.int/covid/cart/Documents/CART_Report_Take-Off_Document.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr></a> guidance on cleaning of aircraft and advice from aircraft manufacturers.</p>

<p>Clean passenger and crew areas at an appropriate frequency to accommodate safe operations for the passengers and crew.â€¯ The frequency should account for the operation of the aircraft and the potential exposure of an infected person. This might typically include cleaning passenger areas (and crew areas if the crew changes) between flights.</p>

<p>Consider providing sanitation wipes to customers to clean the surfaces around them. Address safe collection of tissues, used wipes and other used items from passengers.  Consider cleaning the plastic aircraft security briefing sheets after every flight. In-flight magazines present minimal risk, however, consider removing them as part of on-board hygiene measures. Headphones, blankets, pillows and leather seats should be cleaned after every flight.</p>

<h3>Health and safety promotional materials</h3>

<p>Airlines must provide the latest public health advice to passengers during international flights into and out of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/health-protection-coronavirus-public-health-information-persons-travelling-wales-etc-regulations" rel="external">health measures and restrictions for Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Facilities</h3>

<p>Reduce on-board service to the minimum necessary to ensure comfort and wellbeing of passengers and limit the contact between crew members and passengers.</p>

<p>Ask passengers to remain seated as much as possible.</p>

<p>Consider additional measures, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limiting duty free or other non-essential product sales on board and accompanying these with procedures to minimise the contact between crew and passengers</li>
  <li>reducing the food and drink service</li>
  <li>using pre-packaged and sealed food and drink products</li>
  <li>using contactless payments, wherever possible</li>
  <li>implementing systems to avoid queueing or crowding around toilets</li>
  <li>providing cleaning materials and hand sanitiser so people can wash their hands before entering and after leaving toilets</li>
  <li>making passenger announcements on coronavirus guidance in the arrival country</li>
</ul>

<h3>Air filtration on board</h3>

<p>In general, maximise total cabin airflow and take care to avoid blocking air vents (particularly along the floor). Consider the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icao.int/covid/cart/Pages/CART-Take-off.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr> guidance on air travel</a> and where relevant consult with the aircraft manufacturer.</p>

<h3>Crew management</h3>

<p>Consider guidance from the Health and Safety Executive on risk assessments, any specific <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.caa.co.uk/Our-work/Newsroom/COVID-19-guidance-for-commercial-and-recreational-aviation/" rel="external">guidance on protecting cabin crew</a>, and guidance from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.easa.europa.eu/the-agency/coronavirus-covid-19" rel="external"><abbr title="European Union Aviation Safety Agency">EASA</abbr></a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icao.int/covid/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr></a> in developing risk controls for cabin crew.</p>

<p>Where possible and practical, depending on the aircraft configuration and crew composition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>segregate crew and passengers</li>
  <li>direct each cabin crew member to perform duties in only one sector of the cabin</li>
  <li>designate a toilet for crew use only</li>
  <li>do not share safety demonstration equipment between crew members</li>
  <li>try to maintain consistent teams when rostering flight crew</li>
  <li>restrict flight deck access as far as possible while also maintaining the safety of all flights</li>
</ul>

<p>This will enable easier identification of individuals who might be at greater risk should an on-board infection be identified.</p>

<p>Instruct cabin crew members to avoid touching passengersâ€™ belongings/hand luggage as much as possible.</p>

<p>Risk assessments should address controls needed for shift change overs on longer flights and layovers.</p>

<h3>Symptomatic passengers on board</h3>

<p>A significant minority of people with coronavirus do not show symptoms and when symptoms are shown, these are rarely of sudden onset.</p>

<p>Inform airport and local health authorities and follow their instructions if a passenger suspected of having coronavirus is identified on board before take-off. At this point, if no specific direct contact has taken place between the symptomatic passenger and crew members, no additional measures need to be taken with regards to the management of the crew members, unless as otherwise advised by the local public health authorities.</p>

<p>If, after take-off, a passenger shows symptoms of coronavirus consider the following measures.</p>

<p>Crew should make sure that the passenger is wearing their face covering properly and has additional coverings available to replace it in case it becomes wet after coughing or sneezing. If a face covering cannot be tolerated, the sick person should cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing. Used face coverings and tissues should be disposed of safely.</p>

<p>The passenger should be isolated on board. Depending on the configuration and to the extent that is practicable, the isolation area should be 2 rows of seats in all directions around the symptomatic passenger.</p>

<p>Isolation areas should be planned, considering the aircraft configuration and minimising the risks of transmission to other passengers. For example, symptomatic passengers can be isolated where they are currently seated by moving other passengers, or by moving the symptomatic passenger to the rear of the aircraft.</p>

<p>If possible, the toilet closest to the suspected passenger should be specifically designated for them and not be used by the rest of the passengers or the crew.</p>

<p>Where possible, the senior cabin crew member should designate specific crew member(s) to provide the necessary in-flight service to the isolation area(s). If a cabin crew member had prior contact with the symptomatic passenger, then this should be considered in such designation. Designated crew should make use of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the aircraftâ€™s universal precaution kit. Minimise close contact with other crew members. Avoid unnecessary contact with other passengers, and wash hands as often as practical.</p>

<p>Where possible, the individual air supply nozzle for the symptomatic passenger should be turned off or adjusted to limit the potential spread of respiratory droplets.</p>

<p>If the suspected passenger is travelling accompanied, the passengerâ€™s companions should be also confined in the isolation area even if they do not exhibit any symptoms.</p>

<p>On flights with a passenger showing symptoms of coronavirus, the crew should seek the advice of the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Health Control Unit or equivalent for devolved administrations before any passengers disembark.</p>

<p>After the flight has landed and other passengers have disembarked, the isolated passengers should be transferred in accordance with the instructions provided by the local public health authorities. The industry should consider how to manage the risk of coronavirus transmission in the case of the landing being a stopover, during which not all passengers and luggage would disembark/ be offloaded and considering the local public health authorityâ€™s approach, which may vary.</p>

<p>Crew should accurately identify passengers located within 2 seats in each direction of symptomatic passenger / passenger group during the flight to ensure accurate post-flight contact tracing.</p>

<p>The crew member designated to provide on-board services for the passenger suspected of having coronavirus, and other crew members who may have been in direct contact with that passenger, should be provided on landing with transportation to facilities where they can clean themselves before having physical contact with other people. Alternatively, after carefully disposing of the used <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in a double bag and washing their hands for at least 20 seconds and drying them, the respective cabin crew members could be isolated on board before return to base or a layover destination. Aircraft operators should consider a thorough risk assessment to manage the scenario in which the isolated passenger requires help on board until the flight lands.</p>

<h2>On arrival in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Public health advice</h3>

<p>Airlines should provide the latest public health advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-requirements-to-provide-public-health-information-to-passengers-travelling-to-england/coronavirus-covid-19-required-information-and-exemption-periods-under-the-public-health-information-for-passengers-travelling-to-england-regulati">health measures and restrictions for England</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-advice" rel="external">health measures and restrictions for Northern Ireland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-health-checks-at-borders/" rel="external">health measures and restrictions for Scotland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/health-protection-coronavirus-public-health-information-persons-travelling-wales-etc-regulations" rel="external">health measures and restrictions for Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Airports should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>display government coronavirus posters prominently and make leaflets easily accessible for all travellers</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirusresources.phe.gov.uk/stay-alert-to-stay-safe/resources" rel="external">subscribe for updates to make sure they are always using the latest versions of posters and leaflets</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Border requirements for entry into <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Airports should encourage passengers to consider the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control">guidance on border requirements and immigration</a>.</p>

<h3>Passenger locator form</h3>

<p>Everyone entering the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> must complete a passenger locator form to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">provide journey and contact details before travelling to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>People need to complete the form before travelling to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. They can complete it any time in the 3 days before they travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>There are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules">exemptions for a very small number of cases</a>.</p>

<p>People will need to show the completed form on arrival at the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> border, either by printing a copy, or showing it on their phone.</p>

<h3>Baggage reclaim</h3>

<p>Airports are encouraged to refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icao.int/covid/cart/Documents/CART_Report_Take-Off_Document.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="International Civil Aviation Organization">ICAO</abbr> guidance to manage the risk of coronavirus transmission for ground handlers</a>.</p>

<p>Make hand washing facilities or hand sanitiser available to passengers.</p>

<p>Inform arriving passengers to leave the baggage reclaim area as soon as possible after collecting their baggage to minimise the possibility of transmission.</p>

<p>Make announcements and display posters throughout the airport advising passengers about travelling safely on their onward journey and self-isolation requirements.</p>

<p>Consider using protective separators for lost luggage.</p>

<p>Consider encouraging passengers to use a baggage delivery service where feasible to minimise contact points.</p>

<h2>Leaving the airport</h2>

<p>Inform arriving passengers to leave the terminal as quickly as possible to minimise the risk of transmission. Use measures such as floor markings and signage to assist passengers.</p>

<p>Inform meet and greet individuals that access to the terminal is limited to passengers, crew members and staff. Where meet and greet cannot be avoided (for example passengers requiring assistance) set up a meet and greet area away from the main passenger flow. This will reduce the risk of the arriving passengers crossing paths with other people.</p>

<p>Consider putting appropriate risk controls in place for passengers using hire cars, car parks and shuttles to the car parks.</p>

<h2>Local and national restrictions</h2>

<p>Operators should consider this guidance alongside any national coronavirus guidance:</p>
