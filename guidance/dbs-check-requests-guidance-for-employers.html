<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>An employer may request a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check as part of their recruitment process (previously known as <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> checks). These checks are processed by the Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>).</p>

<p>For certain roles, the check will also include information held on the Children’s and Adults’ Barred Lists, alongside any information held by local police forces, that is considered relevant to the applied-for post.</p>

<p><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks assist employers in making safer recruitment and licensing decisions, however a check is just one part of recruitment practice. When a check has been processed by <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>, a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate is produced and issued to the applicant.</p>

<p><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> is unable to access criminal records held overseas, so a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check may not provide a complete view of an applicant’s criminal record, if they have lived outside of the UK.</p>

<p>Employers should ensure that they have access to all of the information available to them, to make safer recruitment decisions. More information about how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-records-checks-for-overseas-applicants">get a criminal record check for overseas applicants</a>, or those that have previously lived outside of the UK, on the Home Office website.</p>

<h2>Eligibility to ask ‘an exempted question’</h2>

<p>Access to the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checking service is only available to registered employers who are entitled by law to ask an individual to reveal their full criminal history, including spent convictions - this excludes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-filtering-guidance">protected cautions and convictions that will be filtered from a criminal record check</a> - also known as asking ‘an exempted question’.</p>

<p>An exempted question applies when the individual will be working in specific occupations, for certain licenses and specified positions. These are covered by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975.</p>

<p>The minimum age at which someone can be asked to apply for a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check is 16 years old.</p>

<p>More information about who is eligible for a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check, can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-eligibility-guidance"><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> eligibility guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>The code of practice</h2>

<p>The code of practice is issued under section 122(2) of the Police Act 1997. Organisations using the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checking service must comply with this code of practice. It is there to ensure that organisations are aware of their obligations, and that the information released will be used fairly.</p>

<p>The code also ensures that sensitive and personal information disclosed by <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>, is handled and stored appropriately and is only kept for as long as is necessary.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-code-of-practice">code of practice for registered persons and other recipients of <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check information can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Storing information for <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate information</h2>

<p>The correct storage of <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate information is important. The code of practice requires that the information revealed is considered only for the purpose for which it was obtained, and should be destroyed after a suitable period has passed - usually no longer than six months.</p>

<p>Organisations must use any information revealed on <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificates fairly. More <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/handling-of-dbs-certificate-information">information on the handling and storage of <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate information is available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Organisations must also satisfy <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> that they are complying with the code of practice. This means cooperating with requests from <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> to carry out assurance checks, and reporting suspected malpractice that relates to the code of practice or misuse of <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificates.</p>

<p>If we believe that the code of practice isn’t being followed, we can refuse to issue a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate.</p>

<h2>Applicants’ rights</h2>

<p>Usually, a job applicant has no legal obligation to reveal spent convictions. If an applicant has a conviction that has become spent, the employer must treat the applicant as if the conviction has not happened. Refusal to employ a rehabilitated person on the grounds of a spent conviction is unlawful under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (ROA) 1974.</p>

<p>Certain areas of employment are exempt under the ROA 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975, and employers may ask about spent convictions - this is known as asking an exempted question. When answering, the applicant would have a legal obligation to reveal spent convictions.</p>

<p>The code of practice states that information on a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate should only be used in the context of a policy on the recruitment of ex-offenders. This is designed to protect applicants from unfair discrimination, based on non-relevant past convictions. We have created a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-sample-policy-on-the-recruitment-of-ex-offenders">specimen policy on the recruitment of ex-offenders</a> to help guide organisations.</p>

<p>The minimum age at which someone can be asked to apply for a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check is 16 years old.</p>

<h2>Transgender process for <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks</h2>

<p><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> offers a confidential checking process for transgender applicants.</p>

<p>This process is for transgender applicants who do not wish to reveal details of their previous identity to the person who asked them to complete an application form for a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check.</p>

<h2>Countersignatories</h2>

<p>Countersignatories have an important role in the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checking process.</p>

<p>A countersignatory is a person within a Registered Body who is registered with the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> to countersign applications, making a declaration that the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-check-eligible-positions-guidance">position is eligible for the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check requested</a>.</p>

<p>Guidance is available to help you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidelines-for-the-countersignatory-application-form">complete the countersignatory application form</a>.</p>

<p>A lead countersignatory is a senior figure within a Registered Body who will oversee the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> process within their organisation.</p>

<p>Guidance is available to help you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidelines-for-the-lead-countersignatory-application-form">complete the lead countersignatory application form</a>.</p>

<p>The minimum age at which someone can apply to become a countersignatory is 18 years old.</p>

<h2>Using umbrella body services to submit <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks</h2>

<p>An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-dbs-umbrella-body">umbrella body</a> is a Registered Body that gives other non-registered organisations access to <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks.</p>

<p>If your organisation has a requirement to carry out fewer than 100 checks per year, you should use the services of an umbrella body. Your organisation must also be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dbs-check-requests-guidance-for-employers#overview">eligible to ask the exempted question</a>.</p>

<p>If you are already a Registered Body and would like to offer an additional umbrella service, you should email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:customerservices@dbs.gov.uk">customerservices@dbs.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>ID validation for <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks</h2>

<p>When an individual applies for a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/documents-the-applicant-must-provide-">identity must be verified</a> by the Registered Body.</p>

<p>Registered Bodies must follow the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> 3-route identity checking process to validate the name, date of birth and address provided by the applicant in sections ‘a’ and ‘b’ of the application form.</p>

<p>More information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-identity-checking-guidelines"><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> identity checking guidelines</a>.</p>

<h3>Failure to validate an applicant’s identity</h3>

<p>If the applicant’s identity has not been validated by the 3-route process, the countersignatory should mark the ‘no’ box at question ‘w59’ on the application form and return the form to the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>. You may be asked to review this decision by the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> before the application can proceed, which may delay the overall process.</p>

<p>Applicants who cannot provide the necessary documents will be asked to go for fingerprinting at their local police station. This is likely to cause delay to the overall application process.</p>

<h3>Dealing with discrepancies on the application form</h3>

<p>If there are any discrepancies between the information on the form and the identity documents supplied, and fraud is not suspected, you should seek clarification from the applicant.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to amend the application form without the applicant’s knowledge and agreement, as it will invalidate the declaration by the applicant in section ‘e’ of the form and may breach data protection legislation.</p>

<p>If you suspect that you have been presented with a false identity or documents, do not proceed with the application process. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.actionfraud.org.uk/report_fraud" rel="external">report suspected identity fraud on the Action Fraud website</a>.</p>

<h2>Types of <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks and how to apply</h2>

<h3>Types of <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks</h3>

<h3>Basic check - £18</h3>

<p>The basic check can be used for any position or purpose. A basic certificate will contain details of convictions and cautions from the Police National Computer (PNC) that are considered to be unspent under the terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (ROA) 1974.</p>

<h3>Standard check - £18</h3>

<p>The standard check is available for duties, positions and licences included in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (ROA) 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975, for example, court officers, employment within a prison, and Security Industry Authority (SIA) licences.</p>

<p>A standard level certificate contains details of all spent and unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands and final warnings from the Police National Computer (PNC) which have not been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-filtering-guidance">filtered in line with legislation</a>.</p>

<h3>Enhanced check - £38</h3>

<p>The enhanced check is available for specific duties, positions and licences included in both the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions Order 1975) and the Police Act 1997 (Criminal Records) regulations, for example, regularly caring for, training, supervising or being solely in charge of children, specified activities with adults in receipt of health care or social care services and applicants for gaming and lottery licences.</p>

<p>An enhanced level certificate contains the same PNC information as the standard level certificate but also includes a check of information held by police forces.</p>

<h3>Enhanced with a barred list check - £38</h3>

<p>The enhanced check with barred list check(s) is only available for those individuals who are carrying out regulated activity and a small number of positions listed in Police Act 1997 (Criminal Records) regulations, for example, prospective adoptive parents and taxi and Private Hire Vehicle (PHV) licences.</p>

<p>An enhanced level certificate with barred list check(s) contains the same PNC information and check of information held by police forces as an enhanced level check but in addition will check against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/dbs-barred-lists">children’s and/or adult’s barred lists</a>.</p>

<p>If your application includes a request to check the barred list(s) the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> has a statutory duty to consider any information that suggests you may pose a risk of harm. We will write to you if you are affected.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> adult first check - £6</h3>

<p><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> adult first is a service available to organisations who can request a check of the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> adults’ barred list. Depending on the result, a person can be permitted to start work, under supervision, with vulnerable adults before a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate has been obtained.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.isaadultfirst.co.uk/guidance.aspx" rel="external">More guidance regarding adult first checks can be found on the Disclosure and Barring Service website</a>.</p>

<p>The requests carry strict criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the position must require a criminal record check by law</li>
  <li>the position must be eligible for access to the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> adults’ barred list</li>
  <li>the organisation must have requested a check of the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> adults’ barred list on the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> application form</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>’ reply to an adult first check request will contain one of the following responses and will clearly state that it only forms the first part of the criminal record check application process and that further information will follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>option 1: ‘Registered Body must wait for the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate’</li>
  <li>option 2: ‘no match exists for this person on the current adults’ barred list’</li>
</ul>

<p>If the adult first check indicates that the Registered Body must wait for the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate, the details provided may have indicated a match on the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> adults’ barred list. However, further investigation is required to confirm this and you should await the certificate. Alternatively, the check will state that no match exists for the individual on the adults’ barred list.</p>

<h2>Volunteer applications</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> definition of a volunteer is defined in the Police Act 1997 (criminal records) Regulations 2002 as:</p>

<p>“Any person engaged in an activity which involves spending time, unpaid (except for travel and other approved out-of-pocket expenses), doing something which aims to benefit some third party and not a close relative.”</p>

<p>To qualify for a free-of-charge criminal record check, the applicant must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>benefit directly from the position for which the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> application is being submitted</li>
  <li>receive any payment (except for travel and other approved out-of-pocket expenses)</li>
  <li>be on a work placement</li>
  <li>be on a course that requires them to do this job role</li>
  <li>be in a trainee position that will lead to a full-time role/qualification</li>
</ul>

<p>It states on the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> application form ‘By placing a cross in the yes box (at section 68) you confirm that the post meets the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> definition for a free-of-charge volunteer application. Please note that <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> may recover the application fee if box 68 is marked in error and this could result in the cancellation of your <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> registration’.</p>

<p>Only standard or enhanced volunteer applications are free-of-charge.</p>

<h2>Stages of the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checking process</h2>

<h3>Stages of the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checking process</h3>

<p>The process for a basic check varies to the stages detailed below, as stages 3 and 4 do not apply.</p>

<h3>Stage 1 - application form received and validated</h3>

<p>The application form is checked for errors or omissions. The form is either scanned onto the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> system or returned for correction to the countersignatory within 24 hours of receipt.</p>

<h3>Stage 2 - Police National Computer (PNC) searched</h3>

<p>Key data from the application form is compared against details from the Police National Computer (PNC) to search for any matches.</p>

<h3>Stage 3 - Children and adults’ barred lists searched (where applicable)</h3>

<p>Key data from the application form is compared against barred lists to search for any matches.</p>

<h3>Stage 4 - Records held by the police searched</h3>

<p>Enhanced checks are sent by secure, electronic means to the police for an additional check of records before the information is sent back to the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>. Your details may be same as, or similar to details held at any police force across the country. To make sure potential matches are not missed, those police forces will check the details against their information.</p>

<p>We have also published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/police-role-in-the-dbs-checking-process">factsheet</a> which looks at stage 4 in more detail, and explores the role that the police play in the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checking process.</p>

<h3>Stage 5 - <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate printed</h3>

<p>All the information to be disclosed is printed under highly secure procedures and posted to the applicant. The applicant will then need to show their <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate to the employer who requested the criminal record check.</p>

<h2>How to track a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> application</h2>

<h3>Tracking standard or enhanced applications</h3>

<p><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> provides a free, online tracking service that allows you to track the progress of either of these standard or enhanced types of application:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://secure.crbonline.gov.uk/enquiry/enquirySearch.do" rel="external">individual applications</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://secure.crbonline.gov.uk/enquiry/multipleEnquirySearch.do" rel="external">multiple applications</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You will be able to see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what stage the application has reached in the checking process</li>
  <li>if an application had to be returned due to errors</li>
  <li>if the results of the criminal record check have been dispatched</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tracking individual applications</h3>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an application form submitted to <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an application form reference number</li>
  <li>the date of birth of the applicant</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tracking multiple applications</h3>

<p>You will need to provide the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered body number</li>
  <li>countersignatory number</li>
  <li>countersignatory’s date of birth</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tracking basic applications</h3>

<p>The person being given a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check (the applicant), employers and Responsible Organisations can track the progress of basic checks by using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://disclosure.homeoffice.gov.uk" rel="external"><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> online account tracking service</a>.
They do not need to create an account however they will need the application reference number, applicant’s surname and date of birth.</p>

<p>This <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/712120/Track_a_DBS_application_v0_2.pdf">guide provides more information regarding tracking a basic check application</a>.</p>

<h2>How to pay for a basic <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check</h2>

<p><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> provides applicants with two ways to pay for their basic application.</p>

<p>If the applicant is paying, payment can be made at the end of the application process.</p>

<p>If someone else is paying, for example an employer, payment can be made later, but must be within 10 days.</p>

<p>The applicant will receive a payment link via email, which can then be forwarded to someone else to complete payment. This option can also be used if the applicant wishes to pay later.</p>

<p>The application will not be processed until payment is complete.</p>

<h2>Ordering blank <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> application forms</h2>

<p>Registered organisations and countersignatories who can access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://secure.crbonline.gov.uk/enquiry/multipleEnquirySearch.do" rel="external">multiple applications tracking service</a> can order blank application forms online, using the same login details.</p>

<p>You can also call the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service#org-contacts"><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> helpline</a> to order blank application forms.</p>

<p>You must be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/arranging-checks-as-an-employer">registered with <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr></a> to order blank application forms.</p>

<h2>Processing times for <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checks</h2>

<p>Each application is different and the completion time can vary with some checks taking longer, especially if they are at an enhanced level and are referred to the police for checks against non-conviction data.</p>

<p>You can find out more about processing times on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-performance--2">performance pages</a>.</p>

<h2>Update Service</h2>

<p>Individuals can join the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-update-service-promotional-material">Update Service</a> which allows them to reuse their <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificates when applying for similar jobs.</p>

<p>The Update Service is only available for standard and enhanced checks. You cannot join the Update Service with a basic check.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-update-service-promotional-material">More information about the Update Service can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>To enable individuals to reuse their <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificates in the Update Service, Registered Bodies must now include the relevant workforce in line 1 and the ‘Position Applied For’ in line 2 of field x61 on the application form.</p>

<h2>Filtering information and guidance</h2>

<p>Certain specified old and minor offences are removed from criminal record certificates issued from 29 May 2013 – this is known as filtering.</p>

<p>More information about the filtering process can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-filtering-guidance"><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> filtering guidance</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> cannot access criminal records held overseas, but it is possible to submit an application while the applicant is overseas.</p>

<p>In a small number of cases, overseas criminal records are held on the Police National Computer (PNC) and these would be revealed as part of a criminal record check. You must still verify the identity of an overseas applicant.</p>

<p>As the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> cannot access criminal records held overseas, a criminal record check may not provide a complete picture of an individual’s criminal record.</p>

<p>For more information please see the following Home Office guidance:
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-records-checks-for-overseas-applicants">Criminal records checks for overseas applicants</a></p>

<h3>Checking via embassies</h3>

<p>If you are recruiting people from overseas and wish to check their overseas criminal record, you should contact the embassy or High Commission of the country in question.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/foreign-embassies-in-uk/" rel="external">Contact details for embassies and High Commissions in the UK can be found on the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) website</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the FCO Response Centre on 020 7008 1500.</p>

<p>If the foreign check needs translating, the embassy of the country concerned may be able to help.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> is not involved in the processing of applications made by individuals to overseas authorities and will not be responsible for the contents or the length of time taken for information to be returned.</p>

<h3>Certificates of good conduct</h3>

<p>You should try to obtain a certificate of good conduct, and any other references, from potential overseas employees. The standard of foreign police checks varies. For more information about a specific standard, you should contact the authorities in a particular country, or their embassy.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> does not offer a translation service, so either you (or the employee) should obtain a certified translation of the certificate of good conduct.</p>

<h3>Checking an applicant’s right to work in the UK</h3>

<p>The employer is responsible for ensuring employees have the right to work within the UK. The <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> does not check this.</p>

<h3>The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure</h3>

<p>The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) provides protective security advice. This is for companies and organisations that deliver the UK’s essential services.</p>

<p>More information about overseas criminal records checks can be found on the CPNI <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cpni.gov.uk/system/files/documents/42/ca/how-to-obtain-an-overseas-criminal-records-check.pdf" rel="external">website</a>.</p>

<h2>Disputes</h2>

<p>An applicant can raise a dispute if they believe there’s been a mistake in either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the records provided, like wrong or irrelevant information on convictions</li>
  <li>personal information, like a name or employer’s details</li>
</ul>

<p>An employer or licensing authority can also appeal a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check if they’ve spoken to the applicant first.</p>

<p>More information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/appeals-and-disputes"><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> appeals and disputes page</a>.</p>

<h2>Duration of criminal record check validity</h2>

<p>There is no official expiry date for a criminal record check issued by <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any information revealed on a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate will be accurate at the time the certificate was issued. You should check the ‘date of issue’ on a certificate to decide whether to request a newer one. In certain employment sectors, a new criminal record check may be required periodically.</p>

<p>You may also be required by law to carry out a fresh check of the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> children’s and/or adults’ barring lists in accordance with sector-specific guidance.</p>

<h2>Accepting a previously-issued <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check</h2>

<p>It’s the employers’ decision to decide whether to accept a previously-issued <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check.</p>

<p>If the applicant hasn’t joined the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dbs-update-service">Update Service</a>, you should consider the following before making a decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the applicant’s criminal record or other relevant information may have changed since its issue</li>
  <li>the level of that check may not be right for the position you’re recruiting for</li>
  <li>you’ll need to check that the original application position and workforce are correct for the role you’re recruiting for (any original certificate issued from June 2013 will show the workforce ‘child’ or ‘adult’, ‘child and adult’ or ‘other’)</li>
  <li>the police disclose information on an enhanced <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate based on child or adult workforce, for which the criminal record check was originally applied for</li>
  <li>the police disclose information on an enhanced <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate which was submitted for ‘other’ workforce, in relation to the position for which the criminal record check was originally applied for</li>
  <li>the information revealed was based on the identity of the applicant, which was validated by another Registered Body</li>
  <li>that the identity details on the certificate match those of the applicant</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr> certificates</h3>

<p>Following the merger of the Criminal Records Bureau (<abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr>) and the Independent Safeguarding Authority to create the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>, <abbr title="Criminal Records Bureau">CRB</abbr>-branded certificates should be treated the same as <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>-branded certificates.</p>

<h2>Security features of a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate</h2>

<p>It is essential that employers have processes in place that enable them to make safe recruitment decisions. As part of the decision-making process, employers must ensure they see an original <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate. Copies or digital photographs are not acceptable and must be rejected.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate contains the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> logo on the front face and contains a number of security features which can be used to verify whether it has been counterfeited or altered.</p>

<p>The areas to be aware of and examined are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an original <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate has printing on both sides; the paper size is 209mm width x 404mm length which is larger than A4</li>
  <li>the personal information print colour on the certificate is purple</li>
  <li>a ‘crown seal’ watermark repeated down the right-hand side of the certificate is visible both on the surface and when holding the certificate up to the light</li>
  <li>a background design with the word ‘Disclosure’ appears in a wave-like pattern across both sides of the document – on the front of the certificate this pattern is green and on the rear of the document this is purple</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unsure whether a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate is genuine, or you think that it may have been altered, you should contact the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> immediately at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FDIT@dbs.gov.uk">FDIT@dbs.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> notifications sent to Registered Bodies via the e-bulk service for standard or enhanced checks, or to a Responsible Organisation via the basic web service, which reveal no information, may be transcribed in a letter format and will not be printed on <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> secure certificate paper.
The electronic content can be included in a letter or document under the provision that the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> logo must not be used. The <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> logo is a registered trademark in the United Kingdom, and the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> does not allow or permit Registered Bodies or Responsible Organisations to use this logo.</p>

<p>Any letter should have a statement at the beginning that says, ‘This is not a certificate issued by the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>’. Neither the document nor associated guidance on the back of the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate, should be reproduced in such a way that an individual or organisation could believe it to be a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate within the meaning of sections 113A, 113B, 114 and 116 of the Police Act 1997.</p>

<p>If you are presented with a clear certificate and after checking the Update Service it states “no further information on certificate,” please contact the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FDIT@dbs.gov.uk">FDIT@dbs.gov.uk</a>, as the certificate may have been tampered with.</p>

<h2>Withdrawing applications</h2>

<h3>Withdrawing a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> Application</h3>

<p>An application for a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check can be withdrawn but the application fee is non-refundable. The <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check can only be withdrawn before it reaches printing stage.</p>

<p>Any future need for a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check would have to be submitted as a new application, and a new fee payment would need to be made.</p>

<p>Registered Bodies should ask for a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> application to be withdrawn when the applicant is no longer being considered for, or is no longer in, the position. This is because you no longer have a right to see the outcome of the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checking process.</p>

<p>You can read about the roles that are most often submitted to <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-eligibility-guidance">eligibility guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The roles in the eligibility guide reflect how they are written in legislation, not how they are written in job descriptions in contracts. You will need to understand if the duties of the person named in the application, meet the legislative criteria for the level of check you have submitted.</p>

<h3>Requesting a Withdrawal – Applicant or Registered Body</h3>

<p>An applicant or the Registered Body (RB) can request a withdrawal by using one of the following methods:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Once the reply has been received by the withdrawals team, the application is withdrawn, and a letter/email is sent to the applicant and/or the RB to confirm completion of withdrawal</li>
  <li>Please note the application will be temporarily suspended, if <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> do not receive a response the application will be withdrawn</li>
</ol>
