<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide replaces the COVID-19 Operating Principles for Night Shelters. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other broader guidance documents, including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-testing-in-homelessness-domestic-abuse-refuge-and-respite-room-settings">COVID-19 testing in homelessness, domestic abuse refuge and respite room settings</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19">People with symptoms of a respiratory infection including COVID-19</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-safely-with-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19">Living safely with respiratory infections, including COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>The past 3 years have seen a wave of transformation in the way that non-commissioned services support rough sleepers. We have seen the impact that secure, single-room accommodation can have on how rough sleepers feel about their time spent in emergency shelters and their chances of moving on to secure long-term accommodation.</p>

<p>Similarly, the benefits of partnership working between non-commissioned services and local authorities have been manifold. As we move beyond a state of emergency response, the way we support rough sleepers will adapt further and community and faith groups will be a core part of this.</p>

<p>In July 2022 we launched the £10 million <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/night-shelter-transformation-fund-prospectus-and-application-form">Night Shelter Transformation Fund</a>, which made new funding available across three years for non-commissioned night shelters and community projects to transform the way they support rough sleepers.</p>

<p>The Night Shelter Transformation Fund will provide funding opportunities for non-commissioned community and faith groups to level-up their provision for rough sleepers. In many instances, this will mean bringing forward single room accommodation. It may also include developments such as workforce training and development, setting up specialist support services, befriending schemes and community reconnection work, or legal support.</p>

<p>The government maintains its position that providers of night shelters should prioritise providing single room accommodation options where possible.</p>

<p>However, we know that local circumstances may mean that there are limited occasions where a provider decides to put in place communal models to prevent people sleeping rough, particularly in extreme weather.</p>

<p>The principles recommend that providers of night shelters with a communal sleeping model seek advice from their local Director of Public Health prior to opening. Your local Director of Public Health will be able to advise on how to keep people safe from communicable diseases in shelter settings and community projects.</p>

<p>As a working principle, communal sleeping arrangements should only be considered where it is justified by levels of rough sleeping need. Communal sleeping arrangements should be established in partnership with the local authority, with clear referral processes in place between the night shelter, the local authority, and vice versa.</p>

<p>We hope that these principles offer a common starting place for all community and faith led organisations who are supporting rough sleepers. The work that your organisations undertook during the pandemic was commendable and materially contributed to lives saved.</p>

<p>We welcome feedback and suggestions on how these principles could be developed. If you have thoughts you would like to share, please email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:vcfsgrantprogramme@levellingup.gov.uk">vcfsgrantprogramme@levellingup.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>2. Maintaining public health principles in night shelters</h2>

<p>This guidance has been drafted with advice and input from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). This guidance is <em>not</em> specific to COVID-19 but sets out advice on how night shelters can operate more safely, based on public health principles which can be applied to many public health risks, including respiratory infections. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19">Comprehensive advice for people with respiratory infections</a> has been published by UKHSA.</p>

<p>This guidance is delivered in 2 sections, the first covering public health principles for Night Shelter providers and the second covering wider good practice.</p>

<h3>2a Organisationally</h3>

<p>Due to shared facilities and airspaces, night shelters can be high risk for the transmission of infections. As Government and sector, we have learnt a great deal from the pandemic that can be applied when managing public health risks in homelessness settings. Many organisations will have incorporated these practices into our daily lives since the beginning of the pandemic, they are simple, applicable principles that help organisations to stay in control of infection.</p>

<h4>Let fresh air in</h4>

<p>Make sure you let plenty of fresh air into any shelters. You or the venue manager can do this by uncovering vents, and opening doors and windows.</p>

<p>Good air circulation is important because when a person infected with respiratory infections, including COVID-19, talks or breathes, they release droplets and aerosols which can be breathed in by another person. The more fresh air circulated into and the more stale air circulated out of an indoor space, the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles.  See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ventilation-to-reduce-the-spread-of-respiratory-infections-including-covid-19">further advice on what importance of improved ventilation is</a>.</p>

<h4>Limit close contact</h4>

<p>Although social distancing for COVID-19 is no longer required, staff, volunteers, and service users may choose to limit the close contact they have with people they do not usually live with, if they are displaying symptoms of respiratory infection or because they are not fully vaccinated. This is a personal choice which can help reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.</p>

<p>Face coverings can also be a useful tool in reducing the risk of close contact. Staff, volunteers and service users may want to wear a face covering in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>when you are coming into close contact with someone at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell from COVID-19 or other respiratory infections</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when COVID-19 rates are high and you will be in close contact with other people, such as in crowded and enclosed spaces</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when there are a lot of respiratory viruses circulating, such as in winter, and you will be in close contact with other people in crowded and enclosed spaces</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Night shelter providers should be prepared to support those who wish to maintain social distancing, especially around those who may be more vulnerable. Providers of night shelter accommodation may also want to consider the proximity and density of service users, as well as the duration and regularity of any interactions.</p>

<h4>Wash your hands</h4>

<p>Service users, staff, and volunteers should wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitiser regularly throughout the day. Regular hand washing is an effective way to reduce the risk of catching illnesses.</p>

<p>Service users, staff, and volunteers should wash their hands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>after coughing, sneezing and blowing their nose</li>
  <li>before they eat or handle food.</li>
  <li>after coming into contact with surfaces touched by many others, such as handles, handrails and light switches</li>
  <li>after coming into contact with shared areas such as kitchens and bathrooms</li>
  <li>as soon as you return home</li>
  <li>along with hand washing, providers should regularly clean their surroundings and encourage service users to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Vaccination</h4>

<p>People who experience homelessness and rough sleeping are more likely to have underlying health conditions, which can make them vulnerable to many illnesses including COVID-19. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has therefore prioritised them for being offered COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp; Providers should make every effort to support people to become fully vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>

<p>Find <a class="govuk-link" href="https://homeless.org.uk/knowledge-hub/supporting-covid-19-vaccine-access-toolkit/" rel="external">further information and guidance about supporting people to take up the vaccine</a></p>

<p>We know that airborne viruses like COVID-19 and flu are more prevalent in winter, you should look to plan your vaccinations ahead of time to make sure you keep people safe. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immunisation-against-infectious-disease-the-green-book#the-green-book">The Green Book</a> has the latest information on vaccines and vaccination procedures, for vaccine preventable infectious diseases in the UK.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p>Those working with people who experience homelessness and rough sleeping are included in the list of those prioritised for COVID-19 testing.&nbsp; See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-testing-in-homelessness-domestic-abuse-refuge-and-respite-room-settings">further details</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone on site receives a positive test result for COVID-19, they should follow guidance for those with respiratory symptoms. We recommend that providers support staff and service users to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Find <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19#what-to-do-if-you-have-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19-and-have-not-taken-a-covid-19-test">further guidance on what to do if you have symptoms of a respiratory infection including COVID-19 and have not taken a COVID-19 test</a></p>

<h3>2b Individually</h3>

<h4>Self-isolation</h4>

<p>Where applicable, service users, staff and volunteers should be enabled to self-isolate when they present symptoms of respiratory infection, this is a key factor in limiting transmission.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19">Comprehensive advice for people with respiratory infections</a> has been published by UKHSA.</p>

<h4>GP registration</h4>

<p>It is important that service users in your care are encouraged and supported to register with a local GP. It is free to register with a GP in England and you do not need identification or proof of address to do so. GP practices are not required to ask for proof of identity, address or immigration status from patients wishing to register. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/doctors/Pages/NHSGPs.aspx" rel="external">NHS guidance on how to register with a GP surgery</a> clearly outlines that a practice cannot refuse a patient because they do not have proof of address or immigration status.</p>

<p>Community and faith groups can support individuals to register with a GP by helping them to provide a form of identification, this is not essential, but it is helpful to do so. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/documents/how-to-register-with-a-gp-homeless.pdf" rel="external">Guidance on registering with a GP as a homeless person is available</a></p>

<h3>2c Locally</h3>

<h4>Speak to your local Director of Public Health</h4>

<p>A positive relationship with your local Director of Public Health (DPH) is beneficial to your organisation and the people you work with. DsPH are responsible for ensuring that public health is at the heart of their local authority’s agenda and will be able to provide expert advice to support staff, volunteers and service users to stay healthy and protect them from threats to their health. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/directors-of-public-health-in-england--2">find your local DPH here</a></p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/860515/directors-of-public-health-in-local-government-roles-responsibilities-and-context.pdf" rel="external">find out more about the role of a DPH here</a></p>

<h4>Keep up-to-date with the latest guidance on Gov.uk and report outbreaks</h4>

<p>UKHSA is responsible for keeping the public protected from infectious diseases. They aim to detect possible outbreaks of disease rapidly. One way that this work can be supported is through completing a notification form if you suspect a disease on their watchlist is present in your setting.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notifiable-diseases-and-causative-organisms-how-to-report">full list of diseases is available here</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Principles for maintaining a high-quality night shelter</h2>

<p>There is a wealth of good practice within the community and faith sector, and these further principles have been drawn up in consultation with the key nationwide sector networks, Housing Justice and Homeless Link.</p>

<h3>Focussing on outcomes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The service is focussed on helping homeless people build a sustainable and fulfilling life in accommodation.</li>
  <li>The service consults with people with lived experience&nbsp;and develops the strengths and skills of the&nbsp;people it serves.</li>
  <li>The service has staff who do case-work with service users and support them through their stay and towards their onward move</li>
  <li>Where possible, emergency accommodation is offered on a&nbsp;single-room, 24-hour accessible model.</li>
  <li>Safeguarding is prioritised within the service. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/adult-safeguarding-and-homelessness-briefing-positive-practice" rel="external">More information is available here</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strong governance</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The service is well managed and has robust governance to oversee performance, strategy, and financial and risk management</li>
  <li>The service is innovative and inclusive and keeps its service users at the heart of its work</li>
  <li>The service is willing to play a role in the national networks such as Housing Justice and Homeless Link and be part of the conversation about the direction of the sector.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Partnership with the local authority</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The service works in close partnership with the local authority and other homelessness services and avoids unnecessary duplication or competition with other agencies</li>
  <li>The services play a demonstrable role in preventing and reducing rough sleeping in the local area.</li>
  <li>The referral process is coordinated with the local authority and other agencies so that the night shelter plays a clear role in the local pathway for rough sleepers.</li>
  <li>The arrangements for moving-on service users should also be similarly aligned so that as many people as possible have options of where to move to when they leave the shelter. This should include options for move-on where individuals are not eligible for homelessness assistance and housing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Partnership with the local community</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The service works closely in partnership with other local faith&nbsp;and community groups</li>
  <li>The service links service users in with local community services such as debt advice&nbsp;services, immigration support and community-based support groups</li>
  <li>The service links with local colleges, training and employment services</li>
</ul>

<h4>Partnership with local services</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Local authority&nbsp;Public Health team</li>
  <li>GP</li>
  <li>Dentist&nbsp;/ Optician&nbsp;/ Podiatrist</li>
  <li>Local primary care services</li>
  <li>Homeless Health Inclusion services</li>
  <li>Mental Health Services</li>
  <li>Drug and alcohol services</li>
  <li>Registered immigration advice</li>
</ul>

<h4>Partnership with statutory services</h4>
