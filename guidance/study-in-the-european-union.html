<h2>Doing part of your course in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>

<p>Before starting your course you should take out comprehensive <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance" class="govuk-link">travel insurance</a> while in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. It’s important to make sure all your health needs are covered. Talk to your provider if you have any queries.</p>

<h3>Financial support</h3>

<p>You may be eligible for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance">financial support from Student Finance England</a> if you’re enrolled on a course in England and want to do part of your course in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Contact your relevant student funding body if you’re from <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.saas.gov.uk/">Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/" rel="external">Wales</a> or <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>International placements</h3>

<p>You should enquire about international placements through your home institution which will be able to talk you through what options are available and any schemes you might be eligible for.</p>

<p>If you have a placement already organised, you should make sure both your home provider and your host agree that it is safe to proceed as planned during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>You may need to make changes to your plans or start your placement at a later date if the situation changes.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will not be taking part in the future Erasmus+ programme. We are developing the <a href="https://www.turing-scheme.org.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">new Turing Scheme to support thousands of students to study and work abroad</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Some Erasmus+ projects from the 2014 to 2020 programme are still ongoing and placements will take place under both the Turing Scheme and Erasmus+ during the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>
</div>

<h2>Doing your whole course at a higher education provider in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The student support you may be eligible for, and the fees you need to pay, will depend on where in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> you’re planning to study and when you move there.</p>

<h3>If you were already living in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> by 31 December 2020</h3>

<p>You have the same right to access education as citizens from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state where you are studying as long as you were living there and lawfully resident before 1 January 2021.  Read more specific information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-nationals-living-eu">living in your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country</a>.</p>

<p>The fees you are charged should be the same as fees charged to citizens of your host country. You may not be entitled to maintenance grants or loans from the host country unless you have permanent residency or are a worker in that country.</p>

<p>Talk to your <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> provider in the relevant <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state to check the details of your entitlements.</p>
