<p>This accessibility statement explains how accessible the NHS COVID-19 mobile app is, what to do if you have difficulty using it and how to report accessibility problems with the app.</p>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 app was developed by the Department for Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>), and is run by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>).</p>

<p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use the app.</p>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 app is a native app built for Apple <abbr title="iPhone operating system">iOS</abbr> and Android devices. This means it has been developed for each specific platform and you can use the built-in accessibility settings on your phone:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/iphone/" rel="external">Apple <abbr title="iPhone operating system">iOS</abbr> accessibility settings</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006564?hl=en-GB" rel="external">Android accessibility settings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The more people continue to download and use the app, the more cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) can help be prevented. Additionally we recognise and respect the wide range of people it is here to support. To support the breadth of users, and make it easier for everyone, we have made the text in the NHS COVID-19 app as simple as possible to understand.</p>

<p>The app will be updated from time to time with new functionality and improvements. The latest version includes up-to-date features and advice so it’s important to keep it updated.</p>

<h2>Adapting the content to your specific needs</h2>

<p>If you have a disability or other specific access need, you can adapt the content of the app using your device to make it easier for you. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/" rel="external">AbilityNet</a> has advice to help you make your device easier to use.</p>

<h2>The accessibility of the NHS COVID-19 app</h2>

<p>Our intention from the outset of the NHS COVID-19 app has been to meet Level AA success criteria of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" rel="external">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>) version 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>When it was last audited on 21 June 2021, it did comply with all criteria of the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 guidelines, to the AA level.</p>

<p>The app is subject to constant revision due to changing medical advice and NHS guidance to reduce the risks to individuals of contracting or spreading COVID-19. It has been regularly tested with disabled users as new functionality, journeys or content are added or revised, to help ensure it is accessible, usable and supportive of a very broad range of users’ needs.</p>

<h2>How to request content in an accessible format</h2>

<p>If you need information about the NHS COVID-19 app in a different format such as accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or Braille, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/create-case/" rel="external">please submit an enquiry</a> and we will respond as soon as we can.</p>

<h2>Reporting accessibility problems in the NHS COVID-19 app</h2>

<p>We are always looking to improve the accessibility of this app. If you find any problems that are not listed on this page, or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, then please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/create-case/" rel="external">use the feedback service</a> to report the problem.</p>

<p>It is important for us that the app is used by all communities and supportive of people with specific access needs, including but not limited to those who have sight or hearing loss, physical disabilities, who think or learn differently, or have chronic or mental health challenges.</p>

<p>Whilst being inclusive for all, we would like to acknowledge and recognise the British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>) community. We know that for some people who primarily use sign language, English is your second language.</p>

<p>We have worked to ensure the language in the app, website and key marketing and communications material is clear and simple for all users to understand including those who are non-native English speakers.</p>

<p>The content has been written to a reading level of 8 years of age.</p>

<p>We have explored translation of the app into <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> as another language, but the complexity of implementing a media player in every screen has not made this possible. In our ongoing usability research including with people who are deaf <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> users, we will continue to learn how we can support this important community.</p>

<h2>Enforcement procedure</h2>

<p>If you have had a difficulty regarding accessibility of the app and are not happy with how we respond to your complaint, please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/" rel="external">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (<abbr title="Equality Advisory and Support Service">EASS</abbr>)</a>, or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.equalityni.org/Home" rel="external">Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Equality Commission for Northern Ireland">ECNI</abbr>)</a> if you live in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (<abbr title="Equality and Human Rights Commission">EHRC</abbr>) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’).</p>

<h2>Technical information about the NHS COVID-19 app’s accessibility</h2>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is committed to making the NHS COVID-19 app accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<h2>Compliance status</h2>

<p>We are pleased to confirm that we have complied with Level AA conformance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>) version 2.1.</p>

<p>We have 3 advisory issues that are noted below that pass the accessibility guidelines but might result in access issues for some users. We are investigating solutions for these where technically feasible.</p>

<h2>Advisory issues</h2>

<h3>Features native to Android or Apple not used for certain elements</h3>

<p>In some instances, features that you might expect to be used by your iPhone or Android phone are not used for some elements and are instead replicated using other components. For example, as <abbr title="iPhone operating system">iOS</abbr> does not have checkboxes (and instead uses toggle switches); checkboxes are often replicated using buttons.</p>

<p>In Android, some non-standard buttons are used and these are not announced as buttons by TalkBack. They are, however, announced as actionable.</p>

<h3>Content grouping</h3>

<p>In some instances, several paragraphs of text are grouped together and will be read out loud as a single, continuous block by a screen reader.</p>

<h3>Alert notification can interrupt speech</h3>

<p>In Android, a notification that says ‘loading’ can appear at random. This interrupts the reading of text by the TalkBack reader as it will read the ‘loading’ notification before returning to other content.</p>

<h2>Disproportionate burden</h2>

<p>No accessibility issues have been unaddressed due to a disproportionate burden.</p>

<h2>How we tested the NHS COVID-19 app</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 app for Apple <abbr title="iPhone operating system">iOS</abbr> and Android devices was initially tested for accessibility compliance on 17 September 2020 and updates to the app were checked for compliance with <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 Standard, AA level on 2 March 2021.</p>

<p>We regularly test updates to the app with users. For these usability tests we specifically include a broad range of people including disabled and older users with physical, sensory and cognitive access needs. This is conducted by our specialist inclusive research partner, Open Inclusion.</p>

<p>This statement was originally prepared on 12 August 2020. It was last updated on 24 February 2022.</p>

<p>If you have accessibility queries please contact us using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/create-case/" rel="external">feedback form</a>.</p>

<h2>What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

<p>We are continuously looking to improve the design and usability of the app. This is being guided by user research and testing to support us with both technical compliance and to meet user needs.</p>

<p>We’re committed to regular audits of the app by independent specialist assessors.</p>
