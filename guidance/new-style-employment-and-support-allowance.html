<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>If you are ill or have a health condition or disability that limits your ability to work you may be able to get New Style Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>).</p>

<p>New Style <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or at the same time as Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>). If you get both benefits, your Universal Credit payment is reduced by the amount you get for New Style <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>.</p>

<p>New Style <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> is a contributory benefit. Normally, this means you may be able to get it if you’ve paid or been credited with enough National Insurance contributions in the 2 full tax years before the year you’re claiming in.</p>

<h2>Why should you claim New Style Employment and Support Allowance?</h2>

<p>Your (or your partner’s) savings will not affect how much New Style <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> you’re paid. If your partner works, it does not affect your claim.</p>

<p>Most income is not taken into account (but a personal pension can affect the amount you may receive).</p>

<p>While you receive New Style <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> you’ll earn Class 1 National Insurance credits, which can help towards your State Pension and other contributory benefits in the future.</p>

<p>It is a regular fortnightly payment.</p>

<p>This table shows what you may be able to claim depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2>After you apply</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) will contact you within 10 working days of applying.</p>

<h3>If you’re eligible</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will contact you within 10 working days to schedule an appointment that you must attend. It will normally be over the phone with a work coach from your local Jobcentre Plus office.</p>

<p>Your work coach will explain what you need to do to get New Style <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>. They will create an agreement with you called a ‘Claimant Commitment’.</p>

<p>You must agree to your ‘Claimant Commitment’ before you can get New Style <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>.</p>

<p>At the appointment, you’ll be asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain how your illness or disability affects your ability to work</li>
  <li>provide medical evidence</li>
  <li>agree to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/change-of-circumstances">tell your local Jobcentre Plus if your circumstances change</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If a medical professional has said you might have less than 12 months to live, you will not need to attend an appointment or make a Claimant Commitment. Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/terminal-illness-benefits">getting benefits if you might have less than 12 months to live</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you’re not eligible</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will send you a letter within 10 working days of applying to explain why you’re not eligible for <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Work Capability Assessment</h2>

<p>You must fill in the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capability-for-work-questionnaire">‘Capability for work questionnaire’</a>&nbsp;and send it to the Health Assessment Advisory Service. The address is on the form. The questionnaire is different in&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/employment-and-support-allowance" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll be told what happens next, for example if you need an appointment to understand your health condition better.</p>

<p>A Work Capability Assessment is used to find out if your illness or disability affects how much you can work.</p>

<p>If you need a Work Capability Assessment you’ll get a letter telling you what to do.</p>

<p>You might not need one, for example if you’re in hospital or you have been told by a medical professional that you might have less than 12 months to live.</p>

<p>If you’re claiming both Universal Credit and New Style&nbsp;<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, you’ll only have one Work Capability Assessment.</p>

<p>You can ask for your assessment to be recorded. If you would like this, tell the Health Assessment Advisory Service using the contact details in your appointment invite letter.</p>

<h2>How the assessment happens</h2>

<p>Assessments can be in person, by video call or on the phone. You’ll be told how your assessment will take place.</p>

<p>If you’re asked to attend in person&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/attending-a-face-to-face-health-assessment-during-covid-19">you’ll be told how to do this safely because of coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<p>You can have someone else with you at your assessment, for example a friend or support worker. If your assessment is by video call or on the phone, you can ask the assessor to call the person if they’re not with you when the assessment starts.</p>

<p>You’ll stay on the ‘assessment rate’ until a decision can be made on your Work Capability Assessment.</p>

<h2>After your claim is assessed</h2>

<p>If you’re entitled to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> you’ll be placed in one of 2 groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a work-related activity group (you cannot work now, but can prepare to work in the future, for example by writing a CV)</li>
  <li>a support group (you cannot work now and you’re not expected to prepare for work in the future)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>usually be in the support group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do</li>
  <li>be in the support group if a medical professional has said you might have less than 12 months to live</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you’re in the work-related activity group</h3>

<p>You must attend regular interviews with a work coach. They can help you improve your skills or write a CV to help you get back into work.</p>

<h3>If you’re in the support group</h3>

<p>You’re usually in this group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do. You do not have to go to interviews. You can tell your work coach if you’d like to take part in work-related activities.</p>

<h2>How long you’ll get <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> for</h2>

<p>New Style <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> lasts for 365 days if you’re in the work-related activity group.</p>

<p>There’s no time limit if you’re in the support group.</p>

<p>To keep getting <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> you must report any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/change-of-circumstances">change in your circumstances</a>. You may also need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note">send fit notes</a> regularly.</p>

<h2>If you get a sanction</h2>

<p>Your <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> can be reduced if you do not attend interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your work coach in your ‘Claimant Commitment’. This reduction can continue for up to 4 weeks after you restart work-related activities.</p>

<p>You’ll get a letter to say you may be sanctioned. Tell your work coach if you have a good reason for not doing what was agreed in your ‘Claimant Commitment’.</p>

<p>You’ll get another letter if the decision is made to give you a sanction. Your benefit will only be affected once a decision has been made.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">contact your local council</a> immediately if you claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Reduction. They’ll tell you what to do to continue getting support.</p>

<p>If you get a sanction you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-benefit-decision">ask for the decision to be looked at again</a>.</p>

<p>You will not get a sanction if you’re in the support group.</p>

<h2>If you’ve been paid too much</h2>
<p>If you give wrong or incomplete information or do not report a change straight away, you might be paid too much. If you are, you might have to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/benefit-overpayments">pay some of the money back</a>.</p>
