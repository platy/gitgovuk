<h3 id="stay-up-to-date">Stay up to date</h3>

<p>The UK will leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> on 31 October. This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit. It will be updated if anything changes, including if a deal is agreed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up to email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>
</div>

<p>The guidance describes the approach the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> intends to take to the processing of variations to marketing authorisations after exit day in a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<h2 id="variations-procedures">1. Variations Procedures</h2>
<p>The secondary legislation revokes the Variations Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, as amended, which was immediately binding in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and applied immediately before exit day and incorporates in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (“<abbr title="Human Medicines Regulations">HMRs</abbr>”) the elements of that Regulation that remain applicable in a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>The procedures detailed under Chapter IIa of that Regulation, which specifically applied to variations to purely national Marketing Authorisations, will continue to apply to both pending and new variations to UK Marketing Authorisations, all of which will be purely national, after exit day and can be found in new regulation 65C and Schedule 10A to the <abbr title="Human Medicines Regulations">HMRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>In addition, unless specifically highlighted under section 3, the current <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-2/c_2013_2008/c_2013_2008_pdf/c_2013_2804_en.pdf">variations classification guidelines</a>, which explains the type of variation (Type IA, Type IAIN, Type IB, Type II or Extension) to submit and, where relevant, the conditions to be met and any required supporting documentation, will continue to apply.</p>

<p>Any extension application should be submitted <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-licence-to-market-a-medicine-in-the-uk">in accordance with the procedures for new Marketing Authorisations</a>. The variations classification guidelines will continue to apply until the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> issues any revised guidance in the future.</p>

<p>The UK will recognise any Article 5 recommendation published by the Co-ordination group for Mutual recognition and Decentralised procedures – human (<abbr title="Co-ordination group for Mutual recognition and Decentralised procedures – human">CMDh</abbr>) before exit day.  Any specific request from a Marketing Authorisation Holder (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>), concerning the classification of a variation, which is still pending (no recommendation) on exit date or is submitted after exit day will need to be submitted directly to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, who will issue its own recommendation.</p>

<h2 id="variation-of-a-uk-marketing-authorisation">2. Variation of a UK marketing authorisation</h2>

<p>If not the case before exit day, all Marketing Authorisations authorised in the UK by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will become purely national. Any pending and new variations will therefore only be processed to conclusion after exit as national variations, where the relevant national procedures will be followed.</p>

<p>Any centrally authorised products (<abbr title="Centrally Authorised Products">CAPs</abbr>) which are grandfathered will also be national Marketing Authorisations. Transitional provisions make special arrangements to handle these variations and these are explained in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/converting-centrally-authorised-products-caps-to-uk-marketing-authorisations-mas-in-a-no-deal-scenario-grandfathering-and-managing-lifecycle-ch">separate guidance on converting <abbr title="Centrally Authorised Products">CAPs</abbr> in the event of a no-deal scenario</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pending-variations-no-decision">2.1. Pending variations (no decision)</h3>

<p>How variations that are pending (‘no final decision) on the day we leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> would be finalised:</p>

<h4 id="purely-national-marketing-authorisations-not-part-of-any-worksharing-procedure">Purely national Marketing Authorisations (not part of any worksharing procedure)</h4>

<p>These will be processed to conclusion under the transitional provisions, using the same purely national procedures that were in place prior to Brexit.</p>

<h4 id="uk-marketing-authorisation-covered-under-chapter-ii-of-regulation-ec-no-12342008-variations-to-marketing-authorisations-granted-in-accordance-with-chapter-4-of-the-2001-directive-ie-mutual-recognitiondecentralised-variations-type-ia-type-ib-or-type-ii">UK Marketing Authorisation covered under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 (variations to marketing authorisations granted in accordance with Chapter 4 of the 2001 Directive i.e. mutual recognition/decentralised variations (Type IA, Type IB or Type II)</h4>

<p>and</p>

<h4 id="purely-national-marketing-authorisations-before-exit-day-but-part-of-a-worksharing-procedure-under-article-20-of-regulation-ec-no-12342008-type-ib-or-type-ii">Purely National Marketing Authorisations before exit day, but part of a Worksharing Procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2008 (Type IB or Type II)</h4>

<p>For variations falling under either of these two scenarios, whether or not the UK was the Reference Member State/Reference Authority (lead) for the procedure, the variation will be processed to its conclusion as a purely national variation. Every effort will be made to ensure that relevant procedural time periods are observed. The ongoing assessment will take into account where in the overall procedure the application has got to on exit day. Therefore, any information previously obtained, and any assessment reported on before exit day will be taken into consideration as part of the UK assessment process.</p>

<h3 id="pending-variations-decision-made">2.2. Pending variations (decision made)</h3>

<p>In the event that the UK is not the Reference Member State or Reference Authority for a variation procedure and a final decision has already been taken by the lead authority, but not finally processed in the UK before exit day, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will implement the agreed outcome of the procedure.</p>

<h3 id="new-variations-submitted-post-exit-day">2.3. New variations submitted post exit day</h3>
<p>All new variations submitted after exit day will be processed as purely national variations, according to the same transposed procedures, as were in place prior to Brexit. There will be no provision for worksharing.</p>

<h2 id="points-to-note-for-specific-changes-submitted-post-brexit">3. Points to note for specific changes submitted post Brexit</h2>

<h3 id="change-to-finished-product-manufacturer">3.1. Change to finished product manufacturer</h3>

<p>A change in finished product manufacturing site, including as appropriate primary and/or secondary packaging site should be submitted under the relevant sub-change code under B.II.b.1 and be suitably supported. This includes the submission of a copy of the relevant Manufacturing Authorisation or as appropriate a valid good manufacturing practice (<abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr>) certificate issued by the UK, or a <abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr> certificate (or equivalent document) from the competent authority of a country on the approved country for batch testing list (currently <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> Member States, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Where relevant reference to the <abbr title="Database of the European Community of manufacturing authorisations and of certificates of Good Manufacturing Practice">EudraGMP</abbr> database will suffice.</p>

<h3 id="change-to-importerbatch-release-sitequality-control-site">3.2. Change to importer/batch release site/quality control site</h3>
<p>A change in importer/batch release site and/or quality control site should be submitted under the relevant change code under B.II.b.2 and be suitably supported.</p>

<h4 id="importerbatch-release">3.2.1. Importer/batch release</h4>
<p>The change should be supported by including a copy of the relevant Manufacturing Authorisation or a valid <abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr> certificate issued within the last 3 years (as issued by the UK or a country included on the approved country for import list (currently <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>/<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> Member States).</p>

<p>Where relevant reference to the <abbr title="Database of the European Community of manufacturing authorisations and of certificates of Good Manufacturing Practice">EudraGMP</abbr> database will suffice.</p>

<h4 id="quality-control-site">3.2.2. Quality control site</h4>

<p>The change should be supported by including a copy of the relevant Manufacturing Authorisation or a valid <abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr> certificate (as issued by the UK or a country included on the approved country for batch testing list (currently <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> Member States, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, and Switzerland. However, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-approved-countries-for-authorised-human-medicines-in-a-no-deal-scenario">see separate guidance considering any specific exclusions</a>.</p>

<p>Where relevant reference to the <abbr title="Database of the European Community of manufacturing authorisations and of certificates of Good Manufacturing Practice">EudraGMP</abbr> database will suffice.</p>

<h3 id="change-of-marketing-authorisation-holder-mah">3.3. Change of Marketing Authorisation Holder (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>)</h3>

<p>A change of <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>, such as from a company outside the UK to one established in the UK, cannot be done as a variation. That change requires the submission of a Change of Ownership application. It should be noted that after Brexit the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> must be established in the UK within 21 months beginning on exit day.</p>

<p>However, in the interim, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will require a contact in the UK. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will contact <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> to ask for details of a UK contact.</p>

<p>A change to the name/address of the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> can be submitted as a Type IA IN under change code A.1, provided that it is not a change to the legal entity.</p>

<h3 id="change-to-the-location-of-the-pharmacovigilance-systems-master-file-psmf-or-the-qualified-person-for-pharmacovigilance-qppv">3.4. Change to the location of the Pharmacovigilance Systems Master File (<abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Systems Master File">PSMF</abbr>) or the Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance (<abbr title="Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr>)</h3>

<p>As the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will no longer have access to the Article 57 database, any change to the <abbr title="Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> or location of the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Systems Master File">PSMF</abbr> should be submitted under change code C.I.8.a (Type IA IN), provided the conditions and documentation requirements can be fully met.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> should be established in the UK on day one, although those without a current UK presence will have 21 months beginning on exit day to do so. This temporary exemption will allow an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> to assume responsibility for UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> until a <abbr title="Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance">QPPV</abbr> who resides and operates in the UK can be established.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-of-the-outcome-of-referrals-and-procedures-concerning-psur-or-pass">3.5. Implementation of the outcome of referrals and procedures concerning <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> or <abbr title="Post Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Where the procedure has been finalised before exit day, the outcomes in relation to any required variations will be processed based on the decision already taken. Depending on the nature of the required changes, the variations should be submitted under the relevant main change codes of C.I.3 or B.V.b (usually type IA). The actual submission category will depend on the specific nature of the required changes, taking into consideration if further assessment is required and its level.</p>

<p>Following exit, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will be carrying out our own assessments, the outcomes of these assessments will be published together with advice on implementation. Where a variation is required will usually be a Type IA.</p>

<h3 id="submission-of-protocols-and-study-reports-for-post-authorisation-safety-studies-pass">3.6. Submission of protocols and study reports for post authorisation safety studies (<abbr title="Post Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Although not actually variations, whether or not carried out in relation to a condition of the MA or voluntarily, the protocol and final study reports from safety studies should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> within 12 months of the end of data collection.</p>

<p>It has been decided that the most effective way of processing these is according to the Type II variations procedure, and they should be submitted under change code C.I.13. The submission should be accompanied by the appropriate fee, which is the same as that of a Type II complex variation. See also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-pharmacovigilance-procedures-in-the-event-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">separate guidance on our approach to pharmacovigilance procedures in the event of a no-deal Brexit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="submission-of-paediatric-study-reports-for-assessment">3.7. Submission of paediatric study reports for assessment</h3>

<p>After exit day, holders of a UK marketing authorisation who sponsor a paediatric study (which involves the use in the paediatric population of a medicinal product to which that authorisation relates), must submit the results of this study to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> within the period of six months from the end of the study. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/completed-paediatric-studies-submission-processing-and-assessment-in-the-event-of-a-no-deal-scenario"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has issued separate guidance setting out the submission requirements and procedures for assessment of completed paediatric studies</a>. In cases where an initial appraisal indicates that an assessment is required, the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> will be asked to submit the paediatric data as a Type II complex variation to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> under change code C.I.13.</p>

<p>If the results of a paediatric study have been submitted for assessment to <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> or <abbr title="Co-ordination group for Mutual recognition and Decentralised procedures – human">CMDh</abbr> under Article 46 of Reg.1901/2006/EC prior to exit day <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will request <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holders">MAHs</abbr> to submit a Type IB variation to update the product information (<abbr title="Product Information">PI</abbr>) if there are proposed changes to the <abbr title="Product Information">PI</abbr> that can be directly implemented to relevant UK products following the completion of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure.</p>

<p>This guidance will apply from exit day in line with the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/775/contents/made">Human Medicines Regulations (Amendment etc.) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2019</a>.</p>
