<h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19) travel advice</h2>

<p>See the latest health advice for UK travellers following the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
</div>

<p>This information is about visiting the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. There’s different guidance for healthcare if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-spain" class="govuk-link">visiting Spain</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-ireland">visiting Ireland</a></li>
  <li>going to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/healthcare-in-the-eu-norway-iceland-liechtenstein-and-switzerland">live, study or work in the EU</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When you travel to an EU country or Switzerland you should have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also have travel insurance with healthcare cover.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for travel insurance. Make sure you have both before you travel.</p>

<p>Each healthcare system is different, and in some countries you’ll need to pay to have treatment.</p>

<h2>Apply for a <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>A <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> lets you get medically necessary state healthcare in Europe at a reduced cost or sometimes for free.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is still in date, you do not need to apply for a new <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>They’re both valid if you’re travelling to an EU country or, if you’re eligible, in Switzerland.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Apply for a <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> for free on the NHS website.</a></p>

<h2>Visiting Switzerland</h2>

<p>You can use your <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> in Switzerland to get state-provided, medically necessary healthcare at a reduced cost (or sometimes for free) if you are a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK national</li>
  <li>Swiss national</li>
  <li>EU citizen</li>
  <li>refugee</li>
  <li>stateless person</li>
  <li>dependant or survivor of someone with one of these nationalities or statuses</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only use your <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> in Switzerland if one of the above applies to you – even if you can use your <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> in the EU.</p>

<p>You may also be asked to show evidence of your nationality when accessing healthcare using a <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> in Switzerland.</p>

<h2>Visiting Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein</h2>

<p>You can use a UK passport to get medically necessary healthcare in Norway.</p>

<p>GHICs and most UK EHICs are not valid in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Make sure you take out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">travel insurance</a> with medical cover for your trip.</p>

<p>You may not have access to free emergency medical treatment and could be charged for your healthcare if you do not get health cover with your travel insurance.</p>

<h3>Visits that started in 2020 and end in 2021</h3>

<p>If you started your visit to Iceland or Liechtenstein before 1 January 2021, your UK <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> entitlements will continue until you leave that country.</p>

<h3>Who can use a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Some people can get a new UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> which is valid for visits to Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to apply if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an EU, Norwegian, Icelandic, Liechtenstein or Swiss national, and started living in the UK before 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension or some other ‘exportable benefits’, and started living in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland before 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>a ‘frontier worker’ (someone who works in one state and lives in another), and started being one before 1 January 2021, for as long as you continue to be a frontier worker in the host state</li>
  <li>an eligible family member or dependant of one of the above</li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">Apply now for your new UK <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> on the NHS website</a>.</p>

<h3>UK students using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</h3>
<p>If you started living and studying in Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein before 1 January 2021, you need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link">apply for a new UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>This entitles you to medically necessary state healthcare until the end of your course.</p>

<h2>Using your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>
</h2>
<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> covers state healthcare, not private treatment.</p>

<p>With an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> you can get emergency or necessary medical care for the same cost as a resident in the country you’re visiting. This means that you can get healthcare at a reduced cost or for free.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1021&amp;langId=en" rel="external">Find out what your card covers in each country</a>. You can select the country you are planning to visit from the drop-down list.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> is not a replacement for travel insurance – it does not cover everything, such as mountain rescue or being flown back to the UK (medical repatriation). Make sure you have both before you travel.</p>

<p>You’ll need to pay in full for treatment if you do not have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or provisional replacement certificate (PRC).</p>

<p>The following European countries do not accept the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Channel Islands, including Guernsey, Alderney and Sark</li>
  <li>the Isle of Man</li>
  <li>Monaco</li>
  <li>San Marino</li>
  <li>the Vatican</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you do not have your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> with you</h3>

<p>You’ll need to apply for a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC) if you need treatment and you do not have your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>, or your card is lost or stolen abroad.</p>

<h2>Travelling with a health condition</h2>
<p>Buy <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">travel insurance</a> with healthcare cover for your condition. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> will cover medically necessary treatment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Read the Money and Pensions Advice Service guidance for buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to have treatment while you’re abroad, you may need to pre-arrange it. For example, if you need dialysis or oxygen treatment. Speak to your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel.</p>

<p>You cannot take some products prescribed for health conditions with you into the EU. These include special food required for medical reasons containing meat or dairy. There are some exemptions. Read more about <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/carry/meat-dairy-animal/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link">taking animal products, food or plants with you into the EU</a> on the Your Europe website.</p>

<p>UK prescriptions can be used in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-ireland#travelling-with-a-health-condition" class="govuk-link">Ireland</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-spain#travelling-with-a-health-condition" class="govuk-link">Spain</a>. You cannot use a UK prescription elsewhere in the EU.</p>

<h3>Bringing medicine with you</h3>

<p>Before you travel, make sure you either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take enough medication to last the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>can get any medicine you need in the country you’re going to</li>
</ul>

<p>Check with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk" class="govuk-link">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> for the country you’re visiting about local rules on any specific medicines.</p>

<p>You need a letter to prove your medicine is prescribed to you if it contains a ‘controlled drug’. You may need to show this at the border when you’re entering or leaving the UK.</p>

<p>You may also need a licence for controlled drugs if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your trip is longer than 3 months</li>
  <li>you’re travelling with more than 3 months’ supply</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about <a href="http://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">travelling with controlled medicines</a>.</p>

<p>Read guidance from NaTHNaC on <a href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad" class="govuk-link" rel="external">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting prescriptions</h3>
<p>If you need to get prescribed medicine while you’re away, speak to a pharmacist in the country you’re visiting. You may need a prescription from a local doctor.</p>

<p>You may have to pay something towards the cost of your prescription.</p>

<p>If you have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>, you should pay the same as a citizen of the EU country you’re visiting, or a Swiss citizen if in Switzerland. Make sure your prescription is from a state-approved doctor in the EU and Switzerland.</p>

<h2>Travelling to have planned treatment</h2>
<p>You cannot use an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> for planned treatment. For example, if you’re going abroad to give birth.</p>

<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/" class="govuk-link">NHS guide to going abroad for medical treatment</a>.</p>
