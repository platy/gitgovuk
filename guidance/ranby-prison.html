<h3>Entering Ranby</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All adult visitors will have their fingerprints and picture taken as part of a security check.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Ranby has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Ranby. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>If you are bringing small children for your visit you are allowed to take in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one empty bottle or drinking cup</li>

</ul>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<p>There is a visitors centre run by prison staff and  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nicco.org.uk/directory-of-services" rel="external">Barnardo’s</a>. There are refreshments available to purchase at the canteen. You are permitted to bring in cash (coins only).</p>

<p>Men at Ranby can apply for extended visits. These are run on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>During the summer months there is an outside visits area available. Access to this area is restricted based on individual behaviour and security risks.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<p>There are no family days currently running.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Ranby</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Ranby.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms for outgoing calls so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call. If a prisoner has listed you as a contact, prison staff may call you to confirm you consent to being contacted.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Ranby using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner, depending on the rules at Ranby.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope, and your name and address on the back.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Ranby</a>.</p>

<p>Photographs sent from home must have a return address on the envelope. You can also send photos from picture print companies.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers. It will also be screened for drugs.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>

<p>No parcels can be sent in by post or handed in on visits.</p>

<p>The only exceptions to this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>parcels for life sentenced prisoners</li>
  <li>clothing needed to attend funerals and court</li>
</ul>

<p>These are approved by application on an individual basis. Other exceptional circumstances may also be considered.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Ranby</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>Prisoners can buy personal items from approved catalogues rather than arranging for them to be sent in.</p>
