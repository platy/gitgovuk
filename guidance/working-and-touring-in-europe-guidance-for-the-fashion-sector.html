<p>This checklist is designed for fashion professionals (such as models, hair and make-up artists, stylists, set designers, Creative Directors, Business Directors, Artistic Directors, fashion editors, photographers, technicians and accompanying staff) looking to work, perform or tour in an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea" class="govuk-link">EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein</a>.</p>

<p>Further information and support is available through the Export Support Service, which can be accessed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ask-export-support-team">online</a> or by calling the helpline on 0300 303 8955. UK businesses can use the service to get answers to practical questions about exporting products or services to Europe (including touring). It provides access to cross government information and support all in one place.</p>

<h2>1. Important checks</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are travelling to an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you should:</p>

<p>● Ensure your passport complies with the passport rules</p>

<p>● Ensure you have appropriate healthcare and travel insurance cover</p>

<p>● Carry your UK driving license with you (if you are intending to drive)</p>

<p>If you are a fashion professional travelling to work, perform or tour in an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you need to consider the extra requirements for travelling on business.</p>

</div>

<h2>2. Visa/work permits</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>As a fashion professional, you must check domestic immigration rules for each European country you are intending to work, perform or tour in. Some countries allow for these activities without a visa or a work permit,  but others will require one or both, or other documentation.</p>

<p>Some EU Member States use the terms ‘visa’ and ‘work permit’ interchangeably, sometimes with different meanings. We strongly recommend that you check domestic immigration rules for each European country you are intending to work, perform or tour in, as rules may vary depending on the length of your stay and the type of activity.</p>

<h2>3. Transporting samples, examples and finished goods</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Temporarily taking samples and examples to the EU</strong></p>

<p>If you are taking samples and/or examples temporarily out of the UK to work, perform or tour in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you will need to consider the customs requirements for each country you are visiting.</p>

<p>If your samples and/or examples are in your baggage or a vehicle (‘accompanied’ – carried or taken by an individual in their personal baggage, or a vehicle, which have been transported by the individual throughout the journey), you may be able to use a temporary admission procedure in the country of destination to pay no duty on them by going through the green or ‘nothing to declare’ channel or by making an oral declaration for your samples and/or examples to a Border Official. This may mean an ATA Carnet is not required in these circumstances. You can do this if your samples or examples are for personal or business use.</p>

<p>If the samples and/or examples you are taking aren’t accompanied (‘unaccompanied’ - moved as freight by a haulier and/or transport operator where the individual is not present), you’ll need to consider using other temporary admissions procedures. These include:</p>

<p>● an ATA Carnet – there is a cost for this</p>

<p>● a duplicate list – there is no cost but this may be more complicated</p>

<p>If you don’t use an ATA Carnet, duplicate list, or other temporary admission procedures you may have to declare your samples and/or examples and pay duties on them according to the customs rules in the country of destination, every time you take them through customs.</p>

<p><strong>Samples and examples that contain endangered species (CITES)</strong></p>

<p>If you are a fashion professional looking to transport samples and/or examples into the EU that contain endangered species or specimens, you must apply for a CITES permit or CITES certificate. You need to use a designated port of exit when transporting these goods.</p>

<h2>4. Transporting commercial goods</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are taking commercial goods in your baggage to the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, to sell or bringing them back to the UK to sell (for example merchandise), you must check the customs requirements in the country you’re travelling to. You’ll also need to declare your goods to customs.</p>

<p>If you are bringing commercial goods into Great Britain (excluding returning goods) that are not classed as controlled goods, valued below £1,500 and weigh less than 1000kg you can make an oral declaration to a Border Force Officer at the port if facilities exist; or use HMRC’s simple online declaration service before coming into Great Britain. If you are bringing commercial goods into Great Britain that exceed any of these limits, you will need to submit full customs declarations to HMRC which you can do yourself or by using a customs agent or intermediary.</p>

<h2>5. Haulage</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are using a UK-based haulier to transport your samples, examples or other goods to the EU, you will need to consider the movement restrictions on UK-based hauliers. Once in the EU, UK hauliers will be able to undertake up to two additional movements (cross-trade or cabotage) within the EU, with a maximum of 1 cabotage movement within a 7-day period. Cabotage must be within the same EU country where you first unloaded your goods brought into the EU.</p>

</div>

<h2>6. Social Security and income tax</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you are only working or performing temporarily in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland, you may be able to get a certificate or document from HMRC to continue paying National Insurance contributions in the UK. This means you’ll not have to pay social security contributions abroad.</p>

<p>You may need to pay UK Income tax on any foreign income you earn from working or performing in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.</p>
