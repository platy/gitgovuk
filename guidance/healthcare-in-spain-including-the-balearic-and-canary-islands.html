<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This information is about living in Spain. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-uk-nationals-visiting-spain" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Spain</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>All residents in Spain need to register to access healthcare.</p>

<p>Once registered for healthcare, basic state services are free, but there are some things that patients need to pay for. For example, you usually have to pay something towards prescriptions – either a reduced price or the full price.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Spanish national health system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>through entitlement to healthcare if they’re employed or self-employed in Spain</li>
  <li>paying directly into the public health insurance scheme (Convenio Especial)</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">S1 form</a> with the social security office</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>through entitlement to healthcare as a permanent resident if they’ve lived in Spain for 5 years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Spain</h2>
<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-spain">register as a resident</a> if you want to stay in Spain for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>You must show proof of healthcare cover before you can register as a resident. This will usually be through social security contributions as an employee, private insurance or paying voluntary contributions (the ‘Convenio Especial’).</p>

<p>If you’re working or self-employed in Spain, you’re entitled to state healthcare on the same basis as a Spanish citizen. Your <a class="govuk-link" href="#dependants">dependants</a> are also entitled.</p>

<p>Register at your local health centre with your social security number. You can get a social security number from your local <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/OficinaSeguridadSocial/">National Social Security Institute (TGSS) office</a> in Spain.</p>

<p>Your dependants need to register separately.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://w6.seg-social.es/solTse/jsp/Entrada.jsp">Spanish <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<h3>If you are not working</h3>
<p>If you’ve been a resident in Spain for 5 years or more, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residency-requirements-in-spain" class="govuk-link">apply for permanent residency</a>. This will give you access to state healthcare on the same basis as a Spanish citizen.</p>

<p>Once you’re a permanent resident, you need to register for healthcare at your <a href="http://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/OficinaSeguridadSocial/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">local INSS office</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll need to show a ‘legislation letter’ (‘documento de no exportación’ in Spanish) stating that you are not covered by the UK for healthcare. You can request this by calling NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>The INSS will give you a document which you need to take to your local health centre.</p>

<p>If the UK pays for your healthcare, for example through an <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a>, you cannot register for healthcare as a permanent resident.</p>

<h3>If you are not a permanent resident and you are not working</h3>
<p>You can apply to join the public health insurance scheme. This is called the Convenio Especial. You pay a monthly fee to join the scheme, which gives you access to the Spanish health system.</p>

<p>You can apply if you’ve been <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residency-requirements-in-spain" class="govuk-link">registered on the ‘padrón’</a> (at your local town hall) for at least one year.</p>

<p>Find out how to apply on your <a rel="external" href="https://www.mscbs.gob.es/organizacion/ccaa/directorio/home.htm" class="govuk-link">regional health authority’s website</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve lived in Spain for less than one year and cannot get healthcare cover, you’ll need to buy private health insurance.</p>

<p>If the UK pays for your healthcare, for example through an S1, you cannot join the Convenio Especial.</p>

<p>You may have the right to apply for a <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>If you’re a dependant of someone living or working in Spain</h3>
<p>Dependants and family members are classified differently in Spain than the UK.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/Trabajadores?1dmy&amp;urile=wcm%3apath%3a%2FPOIN_Contenidos_en%2FInternet%2F4983%2F10935%2F10938%2F30475%2F30476%2F#177505" class="govuk-link">Find out who’s considered a dependant under Spanish law</a>.</p>

<p>If you classify as a dependant of someone entitled to state healthcare in Spain (because they’re either working in Spain, a permanent resident or receiving Spanish benefits) you’ll need to apply at your local <a href="http://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/OficinaSeguridadSocial/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">INSS office</a>.</p>

<h3>How to access healthcare services</h3>

<p>Once you’re registered for healthcare, you’ll get a health insurance card. Take it with you whenever you visit a doctor, hospital or pharmacy.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>Once registered for healthcare, basic state services are free.</p>

<p>There are some things that you may need to pay a percentage of the cost for, such as orthopaedic services.</p>

<p>Spain uses a co-payment system where residents usually pay between 10% and 60% of the cost of prescription medication. How much you pay depends on your circumstances.</p>

<p>If you’re paying into the Convenio Especial, you’ll pay the full cost for prescription medication. You’ll also pay for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-urgent transportation</li>
  <li>orthopaedic supplies</li>
  <li>prostheses</li>
  <li>dietary supplies</li>
</ul>

<p>Some basic dental treatment is available under the state system, but most people use private dentists. Many private insurance companies have specific dental policies.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Spain temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A  posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Spain using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Spain</h2>
<p>There’s different guidance if you’re a <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-spain" class="govuk-link">Spanish resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Spain before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>When you get your S1 form, you must register it with the INSS.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your <a class="govuk-link" href="#dependants">dependants</a> will be entitled to state healthcare on the same basis as a Spanish citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from the Overseas Healthcare Services. This is part of the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA).</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Spain</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 at your local <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/OficinaSeguridadSocial/">INSS office</a> or via the <a rel="external" href="https://sede.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/sede/sede/Inicio/" class="govuk-link">INSS online portal</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-your-s1-form-in-spain-online" class="govuk-link">Read the guide to registering your S1 form online.</a></p>

<p>Once your registration has been processed, the INSS will send you a Spanish social security number by post. Take this to your local healthcare centre to register.</p>

<p>You’ll be given a medical card which you can use when you visit a doctor, hospital or pharmacy.</p>

<h2>Studying in Spain</h2>

<p>You can use an <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/ehic"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in 
 the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
