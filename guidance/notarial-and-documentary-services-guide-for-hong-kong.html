<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The British Consulate General in Hong Kong provides a limited range of notarial and documentary services for British nationals in Hong Kong and Macao.</p>

<p>Where <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-list-of-lawyers">local notaries&nbsp;or&nbsp;lawyers</a> can provide services, the British Consulate will not provide them.</p>

<p>You must make an appointment for each service and your personal attendance is required. Use the links after each service to make an appointment.</p>

<p>It is essential that you check with the authority who is requesting the notarial document that a document from us will be accepted by them. Where you need a document for a country other than the United Kingdom or China, you must give us satisfactory evidence that the notarial document will be recognised by the jurisdiction of that country. Only the relevant authority can tell you which service you will require. This information cannot be verified by the British Consulate General. We will not give you a refund if your certificates or notarial services are not accepted by the requesting authority.</p>

<h2>What to bring to your appointment</h2>

<p>See the individual services below for details of any additional supporting documents you need to present. For all notarial services you will need to bring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acceptable proof of your identity. We accept a valid British passport as proof of identity</li>
  <li>proof of address. We accept utility bills, bank statements, rental contracts or tax bills as proof of your address</li>
  <li>proof that there is a specific requirement for this service to be provided by the British Consulate General (for example a formal requirement from the authorities of a 3rd country or a UK court requirement)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payment</h3>

<p>We accept payment by Visa or MasterCard. See the full list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-consular-fees">consular fees</a>.</p>

<h2>Services we provide in Hong Kong and Macao</h2>

<p>For information about documents relating to marriage, such as a certificate of no impediment (CNI) and affirmations or affidavits of marital status, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/marriage-abroad">getting married abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>Administer an oath, affirmation or affidavit</h3>

<p>This service is for people who need to swear an oath, make an affirmation or make an affidavit in front of a consular officer.</p>

<p>The Consulate will not draft documents for you. Check first with the Consulate what format is required before the document is drawn up or checked by a professional.</p>

<p>We will request a copy of your document in order to confirm that this service can be provided to you.</p>

<p>What you will need to bring with you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the oath, affirmation or affidavit that you will swear or affirm</li>
  <li>evidence of the contents mentioned in the oath, affirmation or affidavit</li>
  <li>the correct fee â€“ see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-consular-fees/hong-kong-consular-fees#notarial-services">list of fees</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-hong-kong#payment">payment options</a>
</li>
  <li>proof of identity/address â€“ see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-hong-kong#IDaddress-proof">what we will accept as proof</a>
</li>
  <li>proof that there is a specific requirement for this service to be provided by the British Consulate General (for example a formal requirement from the authorities of a 3rd country or a UK court requirement). If you cannot provide such evidence, you should use a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-list-of-lawyers">local notary or lawyer</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact the British Consulate General Hong Kong by using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=China&amp;post=British%20Consulate%20General%20Hong%20Kong" rel="external">contact form</a> to arrange an appointment.</p>

<h3>Make a certified copy of a document</h3>

<p>This service is for customers who need certified photocopies of their valid British passports and British driving licences.</p>

<p>We are unable to provide certified true copies of passports for use in relation to banking or mortgages in the UK. In these cases, you should use a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-list-of-lawyers">local notary or lawyer</a>.</p>

<p>We are unable to provide certified photocopies of any other documents, including those issued by Hong Kong authorities, e.g. local birth, marriage or death certificates. This also includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK birth, adoption, death, marriage or civil partnership certificate, which can be obtained from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/general-register-office">General Register Office</a> in the UK</li>
  <li>UK educational certificates: The only authority permitted to provide this service is the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">Legalisation Office</a> in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not verify the authenticity of documents. We only provide a photocopy of the original document and state that this is a copy of an original document which was presented to us.</p>

<p>The certified copy of a British passport we provide does not verify your identity or nationality. If you require such a document, you should contact a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/" rel="external">lawyer</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk/notary/find-a-notary/" rel="external">notary public</a> in the UK.</p>

<p>The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency no longer issues paper counterparts to driving licences, as a result staff in Hong Kong cannot make certified copies of paper counterpart licences. The only exception to this is where your licence was issued before 1998, meaning you only hold a paper driving licence.</p>

<p>What you will need to bring with you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the document to be copied</li>
  <li>proof of identity/address â€“ see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-hong-kong#IDaddress-proof">what we will accept as proof</a>
</li>
  <li>the correct fee â€“ see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-consular-fees/hong-kong-consular-fees#notarial-services">list of fees</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-hong-kong#payment">payment options</a>
</li>
  <li>proof that there is a specific requirement for this service to be provided by the British Consulate General (for example a formal requirement from the authorities of a 3rd country or a UK court requirement). If you cannot provide such evidence, you should use a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-list-of-lawyers">local notary or lawyer</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact the British Consulate General Hong Kong by using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=China&amp;post=British%20Consulate%20General%20Hong%20Kong" rel="external">contact form</a> to arrange an appointment.</p>

<h3>Services we provide in Macao</h3>

<p>We provide the same services to British nationals living and working in Macao as we do for those in Hong Kong. In order to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/easier-access-to-notarial-services-for-british-nationals-in-macao">simplify the procedure</a> so that customers do not need to travel to Hong Kong, you may enquire with us by using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=China&amp;post=British%20Consulate%20General%20Hong%20Kong" rel="external">contact form</a>.</p>

<p>In your enquiry you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reference your enquiry with â€˜MCAâ€™</li>
  <li>notify us which service you require (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-hong-kong#HK-services">Services we provide in Hong Kong</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Consulate staff will reply to you as soon as possible. If we can provide the service, we will take payment online and pass your details to our Honorary Consul in Macao who will contact you within three working days. You can then agree a time with our Honorary Consul to complete the service.</p>

<h2>Services provided elsewhere</h2>

<h3>Hong Kong Certificate of No Criminal Conviction (CNCC)</h3>

<p>From 1 June 2022 the British Consulate-General Hong Kong and The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in London will no longer issue letters of verification to those applying for a Certificate of No Criminal Conviction (CNCC) from the Hong Kong Police.</p>

<p>The authorities in Hong Kong have declared that CNCCs, the equivalent of a criminal records check, can only be obtained for reasons relating to applications for a visa to visit, or to reside, in another country, or for the adoption of children. Consideration may also be given to exceptional circumstances where a CNCC is required to meet the legal or administrative requirements of foreign countries.</p>

<p>There are some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-records-checks-for-overseas-applicants/guidance-on-the-application-process-for-criminal-records-checks-overseas#statutory-requirements-for-uk-employers-when-carrying-out-checks-on-prospective-employees-who-have-spent-time-abroad">statutory requirements</a> for employers in the UK to carry out criminal records checks. If you need a CNCC you should apply directly to the Hong Kong Police. To do this you will need a letter of verification issued by the relevant UK Government Authority or official organisation to support your application e.g. UCAS, a recognised education institution; or The Nursing and Midwifery Council, a healthcare body.</p>

<p>The process for obtaining a CNCC is determined by the Hong Kong Police. Please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/11_useful_info/cert_no_crime_faq.html" rel="external">CNCC FAQs</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Legalisation of UK documents</h3>

<p>Legalisation is the official confirmation that a signature, seal or stamp on an official public document is genuine. UK public documents such as birth, death, marriage and divorce certificates can be legalised by the UK government in the UK. This is also known as an apostille.</p>

<p>To get a UK document legalised, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1080678/Legalisation_of_UK_public_documents.odt" rel="external">Legalising a UK public document</a> on how to get a UK document authenticated for the purposes of obtaining a Chinese visa and Foreign Expert Certificate.</p>

<h3>Legalisation of foreign documents</h3>

<p>The British Consulate Hong Kong is unable to legalise foreign documents because the UK does not require foreign documents to be legalised for use in the UK. If the document is to be used in another country, you should contact the legalisation authorities of the country where the document will be used for advice.</p>

<h3>Passport numbers change upon renewal or name change</h3>

<p>The British Consulate Hong Kong cannot issue letters confirming the change of passport numbers upon renewal or name change. This is because we are not the passport issuing authority. You can download a free copy of an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1080673/Information_Note-passports_renewal.odt" rel="external">Information Note</a> which may serve in place of such a letter.</p>

<p>If you need a letter providing details of multiple passports belonging to you, you can request information under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/make-a-freedom-of-information-request">Freedom of Information Act</a> by submitting a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/subject-access-request-form">Subject Access Request</a> to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-passport-office">HM Passport Office</a>, asking for confirmation that you were the holder of your previous passport(s). Please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-passport-office">HM Passport Office</a> for further information and contact details. The British Consulate in Hong Kong cannot answer any queries on this subject or the application process.</p>

<h3>Life certificates to claim State Pension abroad</h3>

<p>The British Consulate Hong Kong cannot witness signatures on your life certificate if you are claiming a British pension abroad, including those required by the Department of Work and Pensions. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814507/5_Life_Certificate_Witness_Options.pdf" rel="external">list of professionals who can witness a life certificate</a>.They do not need to live in the UK, or have a British passport.</p>

<h3>Nationality: confirmation of British Nationality and Dual Nationality</h3>

<p>Please note the Consulate can no longer issue letters confirming British nationality. Instead you can download a free copy of an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1080675/confirmation_of_British_nationality.odt" rel="external">Information Note: Nationality - Confirmation of British Nationality</a> which may serve in place of the letter. Alternatively, you can submit an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-for-confirmation-of-british-nationality-status-form-ns">application to the Home Office</a> for confirmation of your British nationality status.</p>

<p>For letter related to dual nationality, you can download a free copy of an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1080676/Dual_nationality_information_note.odt" rel="external">Information Note â€“ Dual Nationality</a>.</p>

<h3>Renunciation and Naturalisation or Registration as a British citizen</h3>

<p>We do not handle applications for renunciation and naturalisation or registration as a British citizen. All applications are handled by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi">UK Visas and Immigration</a>.</p>

<h3>Certificates confirming British nationality</h3>

<p>Please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi">UK Visas and Immigration</a> website for more information.</p>

<h3>UK driving licences</h3>

<p>Please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-driving-licence">DVLA</a> website for information on how to renew UK driving licences.</p>

<h2>Services we cannot provide</h2>

<p>We do not witness or issue documents for the purpose of registering businesses, purchasing/ selling property, confirming identities, family relationships or addresses, or witnessing a signature on a third party document such as a Power of Attorney, as these can be done by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-list-of-lawyers">local notaries&nbsp;or&nbsp;lawyers</a>.</p>

<p>We are unable to authenticate, notarise, verify or legalise any document. Find more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-hong-kong#legalisation-of-uk-documents">how to get a UK document legalised abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Under Hong Kong Law (Section 10 of the Consular Relations Ordinance), consular staff in Hong Kong are not permitted to undertake notarial acts for use in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Recognition or validity of marriage</h3>

<p>We do not provide a recognition of marriage document. Only Courts in England and Wales can recognise a marriage under English and Welsh Law, for more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1080672/Information_Note_-Marriage_Recognition.odt" rel="external">Information Note on Recognition or Validity of Marriage</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot find the service you are looking for on this page, or have proof that there is a specific requirement for a service to be provided only by the British Consulate and not a local notary or lawyer, please contact us using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=China&amp;post=British%20Consulate%20General%20Hong%20Kong" rel="external">contact form</a>.</p>
