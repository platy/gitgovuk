<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Germany.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-germany" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This information is about living in Germany. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance about visiting Germany.</a></p>

<p>You must have health insurance cover to live in Germany. You may still have to pay for some services or to use some parts of the healthcare system.</p>

<p>German residents join a health insurer called a ‘Krankenkasse’ and pay monthly insurance contributions.
Around 90% of residents join a ‘statutory’ health insurer (<a rel="external" href="https://www.gkv-spitzenverband.de/english/english.jsp" class="govuk-link">gesetzliche Krankenkasse</a>).</p>

<p>Around 10% of residents join a private health insurer (private Krankenkasse).</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the German healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>joining a statutory German health insurer</li>
  <li>joining a private German health insurer</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with a statutory health insurer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Germany</h2>

<p>You must have health insurance if you live in Germany.</p>

<p>You can add your dependants to your statutory insurance plan for free.</p>

<p>If you’re employed with a German employer you can join a health insurance scheme through them.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not covered through work you need to register directly with your chosen health insurer.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a German <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register for healthcare</h3>

<p>First you need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-germany" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> with the German authorities.</p>

<p>If you moved to Germany before 1 January 2021, you need the new residence document (Aufenthaltsdokument-GB).</p>

<p>Once you’ve registered as a resident, you can join a health insurer. <a href="https://www.gkv-spitzenverband.de/service/versicherten_service/krankenkassenliste/krankenkassen.jsp" rel="external" class="govuk-link">See a list of statutory health insurers</a> (in German).</p>

<p>Your health insurer will send you an ID card. Your German <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is on the back (if you join a statutory health insurer).</p>

<p>You can go to any GP practice in Germany. You do not need to register with the practice.</p>

<p>You do not always need to be referred by a GP for further treatment. When you need a referral, you’ll be given a piece of paper called an ‘Überweisungsschein’.</p>

<p>If you’re registered with a statutory health insurer rather than a private insurer, you need to make sure you go to a doctor or dentist who treats statutory-insured patients. These doctors and dentists are usually identified as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Kassenarzt’ (statutory health insurance physician)</li>
  <li>‘Vertragsarzt’ (registered contract physician)</li>
  <li>‘Alle Kassen’ (all health insurance funds accepted)</li>
</ul>

<p>Take your health insurance card with you whenever you visit a doctor, dentist or healthcare provider.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>You’ll pay monthly insurance contributions to your insurance provider. If you’re employed and have joined a statutory insurer, your contributions will be taken from your salary before you’re paid.</p>

<p>You may still need to pay part of the cost of medical services you use. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hospital stays cost 10 euros per day</li>
  <li>prescription medicines cost up to 10 euros</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Germany temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Germany using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Germany</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-germany" class="govuk-link">German resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Germany before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it with a statutory German health insurer.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Germany on the same basis as German citizens who have a statutory health insurer.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Germany than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Germany</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 form with your chosen statutory health insurer in Germany. <a href="https://www.gkv-spitzenverband.de/service/versicherten_service/krankenkassenliste/krankenkassen.jsp" class="govuk-link" rel="external">See a list of statutory health insurers</a> (in German). Contact them to find out what documents you need to provide. It usually includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your passport</li>
  <li>proof that you’re registered as a resident in Germany</li>
  <li>proof of income or that you’re a pensioner</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve registered your S1, you’ll get a health insurance ID card. This shows that you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a German citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Germany</h2>
<p>You can use an <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<p>If you have a job while studying, you need to join a German health insurer (statutory or private). This includes if you’re doing a paid placement or internship. For students, this costs around 100 euros a month.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
