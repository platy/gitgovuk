<h2>Book and plan your visit to Littlehey</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>To visit someone in Littlehey you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on that person’s visitor list</li>
  <li>book your visit in advance</li>
  <li>have the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-Littlehey">required ID</a> with you when you go</li>
</ul>

<p>At least one visitor must be 18 or older at every visit.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Littlehey</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

<h3>Help with the cost of your visit</h3>

<h3>Entering Littlehey</h3>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. There will also be a sniffer dog.</p>

<p>Visitors should not wear football shirts, sports shirts or striped shirts, or revealing clothing.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Littlehey. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker (you need a 10p coin) or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<p>There’s a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ormiston.org/what-we-do/our-services/our-work-with-families-affected-by-offending/our-prison-visitor-centres-and-services-for-visiting-relatives/hmplittlehey/" rel="external">visitors centre</a> at Littlehey.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit. The childrens play area is also not available to use.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<p>There are currently no fmaily days being run.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Littlehey</h2>

<p>You may not be able to speak with someone at Littlehey during their first few days. This is because it can take time to approve who they can be in touch with.</p>

<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always need to call you rather than you call them.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Littlehey using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Littlehey</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>
