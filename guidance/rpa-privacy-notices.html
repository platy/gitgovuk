<h2>Who controls your personal data</h2>

<p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is the data controller for personal data you give to the Rural Payments Agency (RPA).</p>

<p>RPA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency/about/personal-information-charter">Personal Information Charter</a> gives more information about how we handle personal data.</p>

<p>The charter sets out what you can expect from us when we ask for, or hold, your personal data and includes the contact details when you wish to exercise one of your rights.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/" rel="external">The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</a> lists your rights under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) tailored by the Data Protection Act (DPA 2018).</p>

<h2>About our Privacy Notices</h2>

<h2>Sharing your information</h2>

<p>For all of the functions (schemes and services) below, we retain the right to share your data with the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs, the Defra group and the European Union (EU).</p>

<p>We are obliged to provide returns of information on payments to the Cabinet Office in support of the Government Grants Information System (GGIS). The GGIS  enables the recording and reporting of grant information across government in a simple, standardised and scalable way. It will improve transparency and provide insight into grant spend, enabling departments to manage grants efficiently and effectively while actively reducing the risk of fraud.</p>

<p>In relation to counter-fraud measures, including the National Fraud Initiative (NFI), we may also share data with the Cabinet Office, Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and HM Revenue and Customs (HRMC). Defra have issued a separate privacy notice concerning the NFI.</p>

<p>We may also share your information with Local Authorities, food or animal regulatory organisations and other organisations listed in the Privacy Notices. The lists are not exhaustive but identify the regular sharing relationships. Ad-hoc or irregular sharing will only be considered if fully complying with the UK General Data Protection Regulations and the Data Protection Act 2018. We do not need your consent to share if that party is carrying out a public function or complies with an identified exemption within the UK GDPR.</p>

<p>The data you provide will not be transferred outside the European Economic Area.</p>

<h2>Keeping your personal data</h2>

<p>We will keep your personal data in line with our information retention period as shown under the individual functions listed below.</p>

<p>We may extend this if it is necessary to carry out a task that is in the public interest or as the data controller requests.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appeal</li>
  <li>audit activity</li>
  <li>complaint</li>
  <li>irregularity</li>
  <li>historic value, as determined by the Public Records Act</li>
  <li>legal action</li>
  <li>a formal request for information</li>
  <li>if it sets a precedent</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible, personal data will be redacted or access restricted.</p>

<p>Processing of information does not rely on decision making solely by automated means (without any human involvement) or profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual).</p>

<h2>How to raise a complaint</h2>

<p>You have the right to make a complaint to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/" rel="external">The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</a> at any time.</p>

<h2>Lawful basis for processing personal data</h2>

<p>RPA primarily processes personal data on the legal basis of a task carried out in the public interest (UK GDPR Art 6(1) (e)).  Section 8(d-e) of the DPA 2018 expands on UK GDPR to say that public interest processing includes processing that is necessary for the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister, or a government department, or an activity that support or promotes democratic engagement.  However, where processing is based on your consent, it will be specified in the privacy notice and you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.</p>

<h2>Call Recordings</h2>

<p>The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) only records phone calls made to and from its call centre. If you receive a call from our call centre, we will tell you if it is being recorded at the beginning of the call. All other calls we make will not be recorded.</p>

<p>We keep call recordings for 6 months, for training purposes, or to make sure that the information you provide is accurately recorded on our systems.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, we may keep recordings for longer, for example, where information emerges to indicate that the content of the call may be significant, or if you have requested a copy of the call.</p>

<p>To request copies of call recordings you will need to submit a Subject Access Request. You can read how to do this in the “How do I ask to see the data you hold about me?” section of our RPA <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency/about/personal-information-charter">Personal Information Charter</a>.</p>

<h2>Sustainable Farming Incentive</h2>

<p>The Sustainable Farming Incentive is one of three schemes being developed to encourage environmental land management. The other schemes are Local Nature Recovery and Landscape Recovery.</p>

<p>The Sustainable Farming Incentive will pay farmers to manage their land in an environmentally sustainable way.</p>

<p>The scheme itself will launch in 2022, initially for farmers in England who currently get payments under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS). More details about the full scheme will be available on GOV.UK later in 2021.</p>

<h3>Pilot version of the scheme</h3>
<p>The Sustainable Farming Incentive pilot is in its early stages. Over 2000 farmers submitted expressions of interest earlier in 2021 and have been invited to apply to take part.</p>

<p>These farmers will help make sure the scheme works in practice. This is part of a process called ‘co-design’. They will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>implement the pilot version of the scheme on their farms</li>
  <li>take part in learning activities based on their experiences</li>
  <li>provide regular, comprehensive feedback on what’s working and what’s not.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pilot gives farmers an opportunity to help shape the future of farming in England.</p>

<p>While making your application and entering a pilot agreement, you will supply Defra and its Delivery Partners (such as RPA) with personal and business information. The table below describes how we will collect, use and store this information.</p>
