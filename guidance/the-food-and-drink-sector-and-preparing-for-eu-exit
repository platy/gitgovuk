<h2 id="importing-and-exporting">Importing and exporting</h2>

<p>There are some actions you’ll need to take if you import or export products between the UK and EU.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-for-changes-to-trade-at-the-uk-eu-border">Preparing for changes to trade at the UK-EU border</h3>

<p>To minimise disruption to your business at border points you should take the following steps:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-a-uk-eori-number-to-trade-within-the-eu">Get a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number</a> so you can continue to import or export goods and apply for authorisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide if you want to hire an import-export agent, or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/declaring-your-goods-at-customs-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal">make the declarations yourself</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact the organisation that moves your goods (for example, a haulage firm) to find out what information they need to make the declarations for your goods, or if you will need to make them yourself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t import and export products directly check that any agent or business you use is prepared.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-procedures-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">simplified customs procedures for trading with the EU if we leave without a deal</a>.</p>

<p>Further information is provided in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/no-deal-brexit-advice-for-businesses-only-trading-with-the-eu">HMRC’s advice for businesses trading with the EU</a>.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-to-move-goods-between-ireland-and-northern-ireland">Preparing to move goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, goods moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland will face different procedures compared to other UK-EU trade.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-procedures-for-goods-moving-between-ireland-and-northern-ireland-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">customs procedures</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-on-goods-you-move-from-ireland-to-northern-ireland-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">VAT</a> for goods moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-for-changes-to-existing-trade-agreements">Preparing for changes to existing trade agreements</h3>

<p>Check the way you currently trade with non-EU countries. When the UK leaves the EU, the way you access existing favourable arrangements with these countries may change. Changes may be different for each country.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/existing-trade-agreements-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal/existing-trade-agreements-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">changes to trading with non-EU countries that have a free trade agreement with the EU</a>.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-for-changes-to-import-tariffs">Preparing for changes to import tariffs</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the UK will implement a temporary tariff regime. This will apply for up to 12 months while a full consultation, and review on a permanent approach, is undertaken.</p>

<p>Under the temporary tariff regime the majority of UK imports would be tariff-free.</p>

<p>In certain sectors, tariffs would be maintained to support the most sensitive agricultural industries and to maintain the UK government’s commitment to developing countries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-temporary-rates-of-customs-duty-on-imports-after-eu-exit">Check the temporary rates of customs duty on imports after EU Exit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="importing-animals-and-animal-products">Importing animals and animal products</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the way you notify UK authorities of these imports will change.</p>

<p>If you import live animals or animal products, fish, shellfish or fish products from non-EU (third) countries directly or transiting through the EU, your consignment will need to be checked at a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries#getting-imports-checked-at-a-border-inspection-post-bip">Border Inspection Post (<abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>If you import high-risk food and feed not of animal origin from non-EU (third) countries, directly or transiting through the EU, it will need to enter the UK via a <a rel="external" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/port-designations">Designated Point of Entry (DPE)</a>.</p>

<p>If you import animal by-products from the EU, read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-animals-animal-products-and-high-risk-food-and-feed-not-of-animal-origin-after-eu-exit">importing high-risk food and feed not of animal origin after EU Exit</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-importing-and-exporting-live-animals-or-animal-products">importing and exporting live animals and animal products</a>.</p>

<h3 id="exporting-animals-and-animal-products">Exporting animals and animal products</h3>
<p>If you export animals, animal products, fish and fishery products from the UK to the EU, you’ll need to follow a new process if the UK leaves the EU without a deal:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You must complete an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates">Export Health Certificates</a> (<abbr title="Export Health Certificate">EHC</abbr>). EHCs must be signed by an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-a-professional-to-certify-export-health-certificates">authorised signatory</a> (for example, an official veterinarian) following the consignments inspection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll also need a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-and-importing-fish-if-theres-no-brexit-deal#catch-certificate">catch certificate</a> for most exports of fish or fish products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consignment must enter the EU via a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries#getting-imports-checked-at-a-border-inspection-post-bip">Border Inspection Post (<abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>) within the EU</a>. You’ll need to consider if your current trade routes could be affected. There is not currently a <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> at Calais. See a <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/vet-border-control/bip-contacts_en">list of EU BIPs</a> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must follow the EU’s customs processes for third countries, including finding the correct <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports">commodity code</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-customs-procedure-codes/customs-procedure-codes-box-37">customs procedure code</a> for your goods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-on-importing-and-exporting-live-animals-or-animal-products">importing and exporting live animals and animal products</a>.</p>

<h3 id="importing-plants-and-plant-products">Importing plants and plant products</h3>

<p>There are some changes to regulations for the plant trade that will affect you if you import plants and plant products (for example, certain vegetables, seeds and fruit).</p>

<p>After the UK leaves the EU, plants and plant products currently managed under the EU <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/issuing-plant-passports-to-trade-plants-in-the-eu#when-you-need-a-plant-passport">plant passport scheme</a> will be subject to UK import controls. There is a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-and-exporting-plants-and-plant-products-if-theres-no-withdrawal-deal#importing-plants-and-plant-products-from-the-eu">new process you must follow</a>.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-and-exporting-plants-and-plant-products-if-theres-no-withdrawal-deal#importing-plants-and-plant-products-from-third-countries-via-the-eu">import regulated plants and plant products from non-EU (third) countries</a> via the EU without plant health checks by an EU member state:</p>

<ul>
  <li>these will be treated as third-country imports</li>
  <li>you must ensure that plant health checks are carried out on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-and-exporting-plants-and-plant-products-if-theres-no-withdrawal-deal#importing-plants-and-plant-products-from-third-countries-via-the-eu">third-country material entering the UK via the EU</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exporting-plants-and-plant-products">Exporting plants and plant products</h3>

<p>For <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-and-exporting-plants-and-plant-products-if-theres-no-withdrawal-deal#exporting-plants-and-plant-products-to-the-eu">exports of controlled plants and plant products to the EU</a>, third-country rules will apply on all:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-plants-fruit-vegetables-or-plant-material-to-the-uk">plants for planting</a></li>
  <li>plant products including some fruit and vegetables</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/import-or-export-wood-packaging-material#wpm-imports-from-third-countries-except-switzerland">wood packaging material (<abbr title="wood packaging material">WPM</abbr>)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="food-labelling">Food labelling</h2>

<p>The rules for what you must show on food labels will change for some food and drink products if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/food-labelling-changes-after-brexit">food labelling changes</a> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>country of origin labelling</li>
  <li>food business operator (<abbr title="Food Business Operator">FBO</abbr>) address labelling</li>
  <li>use of the EU emblem</li>
  <li>use of the EU health and identification marks</li>
  <li>use of the EU organic logo</li>
  <li>use of the geographical indication (<abbr title="geographical indication">GI</abbr>) logo</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK government is aiming where possible to allow a transition period for labelling changes in relation to goods produced or imported and placed on the UK market after exit day. Where a transition period is not possible, Defra will encourage pragmatic enforcement within the UK. These proposals are subject to agreement with Devolved Administrations and Parliamentary process.</p>

<p>If you export food products to the EU, get advice from your EU importing contact on the EU’s labelling requirements.</p>

<p>The UK has no control over how food labelling changes will be enforced outside the UK. The EU has confirmed that <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/eu_food_law_en.pdf">labelling changes will need to be in place from exit day</a> to export to their markets. Other non-EU countries may also require changes to be in place from exit day to export to their markets.</p>

<p>If you place food on the EU market before the UK leaves the EU, it can continue to be sold, distributed or transferred in the EU as of the exit date without the need for labelling changes. Food can be considered to be placed on the EU market if it has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>held in the EU for the purpose of sale, including offering for sale or any other form of transfer, whether free of charge or not</li>
  <li>sold, distributed, or transferred by other forms to the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/food-labelling-changes-after-brexit">food labelling changes after Brexit</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/eu_food_law_en.pdf">the EU’s guidance for goods on the EU market</a>.</p>

<h3 id="organic-food-labelling">Organic food labelling</h3>

<p>The EU organic logo must not appear on UK organic goods. If the UK is able to achieve equivalence with the EU – where both still recognise each other’s standards – before exit day, then UK organic goods can enter the EU and can continue to use the logo.</p>

<p>If the UK does not achieve recognition from the EU, you will not be able to export organic food or feed to the EU from 31 October 2019.</p>

<p>Third country organic products can be checked at any point of entry and only need to enter at a <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> if they are classed as another commodity that requires checking. For example, an organic sausage will need to enter at a <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> that can check animal products.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trading-and-labelling-organic-food-if-theres-no-brexit-deal">trading and labelling organic food labelling after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="marketing-standards">Marketing standards</h2>
<p>If your products are subject to marketing standards some of the processes you follow will change if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Products that may be subject to changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/fresh-fruit-and-vegetable-marketing-standards-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">fruits and vegetables</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hops-and-hops-products-marketing-standards-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">hops</a></li>
  <li>wine</li>
  <li>beef and veal</li>
  <li>eggs</li>
  <li>hatching eggs and chicks</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/poultry-meat-marketing-standards-when-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">poultry meat</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Marketing standards inspections will continue, but will be managed to minimise delays at the border and disruption to trade flows.</p>

<p>If you export these products to the EU, you will need to meet the marketing standards requirements for third countries set out in the EC marketing standards regulations, until more information is available.</p>

<h2 id="your-employees">Your employees</h2>

<p>There are certain schemes and processes you should be aware of if you employ people.</p>

<h3 id="right-to-work-checks">Right to work checks</h3>

<p>Until January 2021 you should continue the same right to work checks on all EU/EEA and Swiss citizens, by using their passport or national identity card.</p>

<p>You will not need to distinguish between EU/EEA and Swiss citizens who were resident in the UK before or after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-job-applicant-right-to-work">check an applicant’s right to work</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/employing-eu-eea-and-swiss-citizens-and-their-family-members-after-brexit#right-to-work">read the guidance on employing EU, EEA and Swiss citizens after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h3 id="eueea-and-swiss-citizens-living-in-the-uk-before-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">EU/EEA and Swiss citizens living in the UK before the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, EU/EEA and Swiss citizens who are resident in the UK before the UK leaves the EU will be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">apply to the EU Settlement Scheme</a> to get settled or pre-settled status. This will mean they can continue to live, work and study in the UK.</p>

<p>EU/EEA and Swiss citizens must apply by 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-settlement-scheme-employer-toolkit">EU Settlement Scheme guidance for employers</a> to give further information to your employees.</p>

<h3 id="eueea-and-swiss-citizens-who-arrive-in-the-uk-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">EU/EEA and Swiss citizens who arrive in the UK after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, EU, EEA and Swiss citizens arriving in the UK from exit day to 31 December 2020 can continue to come to the UK, to live, work and study without applying for a visa in advance.</p>

<p>After free movement ends, if they want to stay for longer than 3 months, they can read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/european-temporary-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">guidance on staying in the UK</a> to find out what they’ll need to do.</p>

<p>Irish citizens can continue to live, work and study in the UK, just as before.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>From 1 January 2021, a new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-future-skills-based-immigration-system">skills-based immigration system</a> will launch.</p>
</div>

<p>For non-EU nationals, EU Exit will not affect the application process for work visas.</p>

<h2 id="chemical-regulations">Chemical regulations</h2>

<p>If your business uses chemicals, you should take the following steps to prepare for the UK leaving the EU without a deal:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Visit the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) website for information on <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/brexit/brexit-no-deal-guidance.htm">how each of the chemicals regimes will be affected</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/brexit/uk-reach-additional-guidance.pdf">UK REACH guidance</a> for actions for businesses using chemicals. You can see actions for different types of businesses in the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/brexit/ag-scenario-table.pdf">scenario summary table</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Find out what you can do to <a href="#preparing-for-changes-to-trade-at-the-UK-EU-border">prepare for disruption to trade at the UK border</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should check contingency plans across your supply chain to find out what information you need to supply to UK agencies, logistics providers, suppliers and customers.</p>

<h2 id="data-protection">Data protection</h2>

<p>Your business will need to make sure it follows data protection law if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.</p>

<p>If you operate across the EU or exchange personal data with organisations in the EEA, there may be changes that you need to make before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-protection-eu-exit-guidance/leaving-the-eu-without-a-deal-6-steps-to-take">6 step process</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-brexit/data-protection-if-there-s-no-brexit-deal/">data protection guidance from the Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a rel="external" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-brexit/standard-contractual-clauses-for-transfers-from-the-eea-to-the-uk-interactive-tool/">check if you can use standard contractual clauses (SCCs)</a> for transfers from the EEA to the UK.</p>
