<h2>Diabetes mellitus</h2>

<h4>Information sent to drivers</h4>
<p>Insulin-treated drivers are sent a detailed letter from DVLA explaining the licensing requirements and driving responsibilities (see the INF294 leaflet in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appendices-assessing-fitness-to-drive#appendix-d-inf1882-leaflet">Appendix D</a>). <br><br>All drivers with diabetes must follow the information provided in ‘Information for drivers with diabetes’, which includes a notice of when they must contact DVLA (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appendices-assessing-fitness-to-drive#appendix-d-inf1882-leaflet">see Appendix D</a>).</p>

<h2>Insulin-treated diabetes</h2>

<h4>Adequate awareness of hypoglycaemia</h4>
<p>The Secretary of State’s Honorary Medical Advisory Panel on Driving and Diabetes has defined adequate awareness of hypoglycaemia as whether ‘the licence holder/applicant [is] capable of bringing their vehicle to a safe controlled stop’.</p>

<p>This is a matter of professional judgement and as a guide the duration of hypoglycaemic symptoms experienced should be compatible with bringing a vehicle to a safe controlled stop.</p>

<p>The reliance on alarms on glucose monitoring devices are not accepted as a substitute for adequate symptomatic or physiological awareness of hypoglycaemia experienced by the driver.</p>

<p>Should a driver become reliant on these alarms to advise them that they are hypoglycaemic they must stop driving and notify DVLA.</p>

<h4>Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia</h4>
<p>The Panel has also defined impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia for Group 1 drivers as ‘an inability to detect the onset of hypoglycaemia because of total absence of warning symptoms’.</p>

<p>Group 2 drivers must have full awareness of hypoglycaemia.</p>

<h4>Severe hypoglycaemia</h4>
<p>The law defines ‘severe’ as an episode of hypoglycaemia requiring the assistance of another person.</p>

<p>Group 1 drivers - episodes of hypoglycaemia occurring during established sleep are no longer considered relevant for licensing purposes, unless there are concerns regarding their hypoglycaemia awareness.</p>

<p>Group 2 drivers - must report all episodes of severe hypoglycaemia requiring the assistance of another person, including sleep episodes.</p>

<h4>Interstitial glucose monitoring systems</h4>
<p>These devices are more widely known as flash glucose monitoring systems (Flash GM) and real-time continuous glucose monitoring systems (RT-CGM).</p>

<h4>Group 1</h4>

<p>These systems may be used for monitoring glucose at times relevant to driving Group 1 vehicles. Users of these systems must carry finger prick capillary glucose testing equipment for driving purposes as there are times when a confirmatory finger prick blood glucose level is required.</p>

<p>If using an interstitial fluid continuous glucose monitoring system (Flash GM or RT-CGM), the blood glucose level must be confirmed with a finger prick blood glucose reading in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when the glucose level is 4.0 mmol/L or below</li>
  <li>when symptoms of hypoglycaemia are being experienced</li>
  <li>when the glucose monitoring system gives a reading that is not consistent with the symptoms being experienced (for example, symptoms of hypoglycaemia and the system reading does not indicate this) - see the INF294 leaflet in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appendices-assessing-fitness-to-drive#appendix-d-inf1882-leaflet">Appendix D</a> for further details</li>
</ul>

<h4>Group 2</h4>

<p>There is a legal requirement for Group 2 drivers to monitor their blood glucose for the purpose of Group 2 driving.</p>

<p>Flash GM and RT-CGM interstitial fluid glucose monitoring systems are not permitted for the purposes of Group 2 driving and licensing.</p>

<p>Group 2 drivers who use these devices must continue to monitor finger prick capillary blood glucose levels with the regularity defined below.</p>

<h3>Group 1 and Group 2 requirements for insulin-treated drivers licensed on review</h3>

<p>The Secretary of State’s Honorary Medical Advisory Panel on Driving and Diabetes has defined the glucose self-monitoring requirements for licensing as follows.</p>

<h4>Group 1 car and motorcycle</h4>

<ul>
  <li>glucose testing no more than 2 hours before the start of the first journey
<br>and</li>
  <li>every 2 hours after driving has started</li>
  <li>a maximum of 2 hours should pass between the pre-driving glucose test and the first glucose check performed after driving has started</li>
  <li>applicants will be asked to sign an undertaking to comply with the directions of the healthcare professionals treating their diabetes and to report any significant change in their condition to DVLA immediately</li>
</ul>

<p>More frequent self-monitoring may be required with any greater risk of hypoglycaemia (physical activity, altered meal routine).</p>

<h4>Group 2 bus and lorry</h4>

<ul>
  <li>regular blood glucose testing – at least twice daily including on days when not driving 
<br>and</li>
  <li>no more than 2 hours before the start of the first journey
<br>and</li>
  <li>every 2 hours after driving has started</li>
  <li>a maximum of 2 hours should pass between the pre-driving glucose test and the first glucose check performed after driving has started</li>
</ul>

<p>More frequent self-monitoring may be required with any greater risk of hypoglycaemia (physical activity, altered meal routine), in which case a bus or lorry driver may be licensed if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use one or more blood glucose meters with memory functions to ensure 3 months of readings whilst on insulin that will be available for assessment</li>
</ul>

<h3>How DVLA checks diabetes management requirements for insulin-treated Group 2 bus and lorry licensing</h3>
<p>DVLA takes the following measures to ensure the requirements are met for licensing of insulin-treated Group 2 bus and lorry drivers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applicants must stop driving Group 2 vehicles when they commence insulin until DVLA has made a licensing decision</li>
  <li>requires the applicant’s usual doctor who provides diabetes care to undertake an examination at least every 3 years including review of the previous 3 months of blood glucose meter readings</li>
  <li>arranges an examination to be undertaken every 12 months by an independent consultant specialist in diabetes if the examination by their usual doctor is satisfactory</li>
  <li>at the examination, the consultant will require sight of blood glucose self-monitoring records for the previous 3 months stored on the memory of a blood glucose meter</li>
  <li>the license application process cannot start until an applicant’s condition has been stable for at least 1 month, and they can provide 2 months of blood glucose readings taken whilst on insulin</li>
  <li>applicants will be asked to sign an undertaking to comply with the directions of the healthcare professionals treating their diabetes and to report any significant change in their condition to DVLA immediately</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recurrent severe hypoglycaemia guidance</h3>

<h4>Advice for Group 1 drivers who have had more than one episode of severe hypoglycaemia while awake in the last 12 months</h4>

<p>✘- Must not drive and must notify DVLA.</p>

<p>DVLA will then carry out medical enquiries before a licensing decision is made.</p>

<h4>Advice for Group 2 drivers after every episode of severe hypoglycaemia in the last 12 months</h4>

<p>✘- Must not drive and must notify DVLA following all episodes of severe hypoglycaemia.</p>

<h3>Severe hypoglycaemia whilst driving</h3>
<p>All Group 1 and Group 2 drivers who experience an episode of severe hypoglycaemia whilst driving must not drive and must notify DVLA.</p>

<h2>Severe hypoglycaemia due to causes other than diabetes management</h2>

<p>Examples include hypoglycaemia post-bariatric surgery or in association with eating disorders, and the restriction applies for both car and motorcycle, and bus and lorry drivers.</p>

<h3>Severe hypoglycaemia</h3>

<p>The law defines ‘severe’ as an episode of hypoglycaemia requiring the assistance of another person.</p>

<p>✘- If there are episodes of severe hypoglycaemia from any cause other than diabetes treatment driving must stop and the driver must notify DVLA</p>
