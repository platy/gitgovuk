<p>International cruise ship travel means staying overnight for at least 1 night on a sea-going cruise ship with people from multiple households starting, calling or ending at ports outside of the UK.</p>

<h2>Cruise ships and COVID-19</h2>

<p>Although operators have taken steps to improve infection control, cruise ships continue to experience COVID-19 outbreaks, affecting passengers and seafarers. The confined setting on board and combination of multiple households enables COVID-19 to spread faster than it is able to elsewhere.</p>

<p>Cruises with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases have previously been denied permission to dock or to disembark passengers. This can have serious implications for passengers and seafarers on board. You should check the protocols of the cruise operator to ensure you are comfortable with safety measures.</p>

<p>The UK Chamber of Shipping has published guidance for UK <a href="https://ukchamberofshipping.com/documents/2383/OPERATORS_Framework_for_UK_Cruise_Operations_during_COVID-19_20201002.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">cruise operators</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ukchamberofshipping.com/documents/2384/PASSENGERS__Framework_for_UK_Cruise_Operations_during_COVID-19_20201002.pdf" rel="external">passengers</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://ukchamberofshipping.com/documents/2385/SEAFARERS_Framework_for_UK_Cruise_Operations_during_COVID-19_20201002.pdf" class="govuk-link">seafarers</a> on cruises during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>Get travel insurance</h2>

<p>Before boarding a cruise you should buy travel insurance, and make sure you are content with the level of cover it provides. If you already have travel insurance check it is valid and provides appropriate cover.</p>

<p>Some operators may require evidence of a certain level of travel insurance if you have not completed a course of COVID-19 vaccination (this may include having a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-booster-vaccine/" class="govuk-link">booster dose</a>). You should consult your operator’s booking conditions and contact them if you require further information.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For further information on why travel insurance is important, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance" class="govuk-link">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Plan ahead: top tips</h2>

<p>Before booking a cruise, you should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your own health needs and the risks that relate to you, particularly if you are at <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/" class="govuk-link">higher risk from COVID-19</a>. Speak with your doctor before booking, if you are concerned. You should take face coverings, hand gel and wash your hands regularly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>completing a course of COVID-19 vaccination (including having a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-booster-vaccine/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">booster dose</a>) at least 14 days before going on a cruise. The company you are travelling with may require this</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you feel unwell in any way while on board, you will need to report this immediately to the cruise ship’s staff and follow their instructions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>access to healthcare may be limited on-board. For example, intensive care beds and oxygen provision are limited and urgent medical evacuation to a hospital on land may not be possible. Research the facilities on the ship you intend to sail on before booking your holiday. If you take specialist medication, you should take more than your journey’s duration, in case you are abroad for longer than expected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you may be required to quarantine on board or at designated facilities if your ship is affected by a COVID-19 outbreak. Check with your operator to ensure you are aware of outbreak contingency measures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you may need to pay for costs including medical care, quarantine, testing and return travel to the UK if your cruise is affected by a COVID-19 outbreak. Consult your operator and insurance provider to ensure you are aware of what is and what is not included in your policy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you may be asked to disembark the cruise ship and return to the UK at your own cost if you fail to follow operator protocols, including during official excursions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should comply with the local restrictions in all the countries you will be travelling to or through, even if only for a short shore visit. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-abroad-from-england-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance on travel abroad</a> and the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">information for all countries and territories in FCDO travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>Check what you must do to return to the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you should not travel to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">red list country</a>. If your ship calls at a red list country, you have visited that country for the purposes of entering the UK, even if you remain on board and do not go ashore. You must follow government rules for entering the UK from a red list country</li>
  <li>if your cruise does not include red list countries, check what you must do to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Different rules apply for completing your Passenger Locator Form when entering the UK on a cruise. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">Passenger Locator Form (PLF) guidance</a> and ensure you complete it correctly.</p>

<p>Your operator is responsible for your health, safety and security for the cruise, and for repatriation, if that is necessary. While you are on board a ship it may be difficult for the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office to provide consular assistance to you.</p>

<p>This advice is reviewed continuously and informed by the latest public health medical advice.</p>
