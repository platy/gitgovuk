<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Hollesley Bay has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should wear smart clothes (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>Each adult visitor is allowed to take in a maximum of £10 in coins (notes are not allowed).</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Hollesley Bay. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Hollesley Bay</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Hollesley Bay.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Hollesley Bay using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the prison’s rules.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Hollesley Bay</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<p>People in Hollesley Bay are given a list of approved items that can be sent to them as gifts. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Hollesley Bay</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Life at Hollesley Bay</h2>

<h3>Security and safeguarding</h3>

<p>For further information about what to do when you are worried or concerned about someone in prison <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/pages/category/need-urgent-help?Take=24" rel="external">visit the Prisoners’ Families helpline website</a>.</p>

<p>All safeguarding processes are overseen by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.suffolkas.org/" rel="external">Suffolk Safeguarding Partnership</a>.</p>

<h3>Arrival and first night</h3>

<p>They will get to speak to someone who will check how they’re feeling and ask about any immediate health and wellbeing needs.</p>

<h3>Induction</h3>
<p>Each person who arrives at Hollesley Bay gets an induction that lasts about a week. They will meet professionals who will help them with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and wellbeing, including mental and sexual health</li>
  <li>any substance misuse issues, including drugs and alcohol</li>
  <li>personal development in custody and on release, including skills, education and training</li>
  <li>other support (sometimes called ‘interventions’), such as managing difficult emotions</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone also finds out about the rules, fire safety, and how things like calls and visits work.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>Almost 500 men are housed in 9 residential units over an 85 acre site.</p>

<p>The units are called Bosmere, Blything, Cosforde, Hoxon, Mutfords, Samforde, Stow, Theadling and Wilforde, which are all Suffolk place names from the Middle Ages.</p>

<h3>Education and work</h3>
<p>There is part-time education in English, maths, IT and employability provided by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://peopleplus.co.uk/" rel="external">Peopleplus</a>.</p>

<p>They also offer full-time vocational courses in bricklaying, plastering, plumbing, carpentry and painting and decorating. Also available are qualifications in forklift truck, roofing, barista, hospitality, a ‘firebreak’ course with Essex Fire Service and the construction skills certificate scheme (to earn a CSCS card).</p>

<p>Prisoners can also learn to drive with a local driving school.</p>

<p>There are work opportunities in kitchens, gardens, clothing exchange, recycling, staff areas, transport and cleaning. NVQs are available through kitchen and staff area work.</p>

<p>Men can also work with the local community on placements or in paid ‘working out’ schemes. Paid workers have the option to self-drive or get to work on public transport. All job requests will be assessed and considered on an individual basis.</p>

<p>Hollesley Bay aims to support prisoners into employment that will continue once discharged.</p>

<p>There is a sports centre, which offers a wide range of activities. Men can get qualified in healthy living, fitness, circuits and first aid.</p>

<p>The Chaplaincy offers multi-faith services and pastoral care.</p>

<h3>Temporary release</h3>
<p>The resettlement team helps reduce re-offending and tries to get men into full-time work, training or education. The prison works closely with partners providing career support, accommodation and benefits advice. Men have access to a job club and virtual campus that allows them to look for jobs anywhere in the UK.</p>

<p>Release on Temporary Licence (ROTL), when men spend time in the community before release, is part of this. This can be daily (to a placement in the local community) or weekly (spending time with family) and then monthly when men can go home for up to 4 nights.</p>

<p>Once approved for ROTL, prisoners can apply for paid work through vacancies with employers that work with the prison or they can find their own work. Paid workers contribute a percentage of their wages to the victims fund.</p>

<h3>Organisations Hollesley Bay works with</h3>
<p>Hollesley Bay offers up to 5 restorative justice courses a year.</p>

<p>Sycamore Tree courses are run by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonfellowship.org.uk/our-work/sycamore-tree/" rel="external">Prison Fellowship</a> and teach a volunteer-led victim awareness programme and results in a victim of crime coming in to talk about the impact the crime has had on their lives.</p>
