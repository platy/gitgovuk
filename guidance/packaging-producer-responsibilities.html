<p>If your business or organisation produces or uses packaging, or sells packaged goods, you may be classed as an obligated packaging producer. Obligated packaging producers must follow rules which help to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce the amount of packaging produced in the first place</li>
  <li>reduce how much packaging waste goes to landfill</li>
  <li>increase the amount of packaging waste that is recycled</li>
</ul>

<p>These are in addition to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview">waste duty of care</a> rules all businesses must follow.</p>

<p>Every year an obligated packaging producer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register as a packaging producer by 7 April</li>
  <li>meet their recycling obligation</li>
  <li>obtain evidence of compliance</li>
  <li>submit a certificate of compliance (<abbr title="certificate of compliance">CoC</abbr>) by 31 January the following year</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The way UK organisations responsible for packaging must carry out their recycling responsibilities is changing.</p>

<p>If you’re affected by the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-waste-prepare-for-extended-producer-responsibility">extended producer responsibility (EPR) for packaging</a>, you must take steps to collect the correct packaging data from 1 January 2023.</p>
</div>

<h2>Check if you are an obligated packaging producer</h2>

<h3>Packaging definition</h3>

<p>‘Packaging’ is any material used to hold, protect, handle, deliver and present goods. This includes packaging for raw materials right through to finished goods to be sold or being sold. For example, pallets, boxes, bags, tape for wrapping, rolls, tubes and clothes hangers sold as part of the clothing item.</p>

<h3>What an obligated packaging producer is</h3>

<p>You are an ‘obligated’ packaging producer if you (or a <a class="govuk-link" href="#BG">group</a> of companies you are part of) meet both of the following criteria. You:</p>

<ul>
  <li>handled 50 tonnes of packaging materials or packaging in the previous calendar year</li>
  <li>have a turnover of more than £2 million a year (based on the last financial year’s accounts)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your business provides <a class="govuk-link" href="#Licensors">licences</a> to other businesses such as franchises or pub leases, any packaging they handle may contribute towards the 50 tonne threshold for your business.</p>

<h3>What ‘handling’ means</h3>

<p>Handling means you do all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry out one or more of the activities in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#AL">activity list</a> or have these activities carried out on your behalf</li>
  <li>own the packaging on which the activities are carried out</li>
  <li>supply packaging or packaging materials at any stage in the chain or to the final user of the packaging</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not handling packaging or packaging materials you use internally within your business.</p>

<h3>Activity list: description</h3>

<p>The activities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>raw material manufacture – produce raw materials for packaging manufacture</li>
  <li>packaging conversion – convert raw materials into packaging</li>
  <li>packing or filling – put goods into packaging or put packaging around goods</li>
  <li>selling – supply packaged goods to the end user</li>
  <li>importing – import packaged goods or packaging materials from outside the UK, including raw materials that will become packaging, such as plastic pellets used to make bottles</li>
  <li>service provider – a business that supplies packaging by hiring it out or lending it</li>
</ul>

<h3>Check the tonnage you handle</h3>

<p>When you work out if you handle 50 tonnes of packaging or more, do not include packaging or packing material you export or give to someone else to export. Export includes supplies sent to the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and Republic of Ireland. You must be able to demonstrate what packaging you have exported.</p>

<h3>When your business is part of a group</h3>

<p>If you are a group you must add up the total amount of packaging handled and annual turnovers to see if you are an obligated packaging producer.</p>

<p>If you are a holding company and you have 2 or more subsidiaries that handle packaging, or both you the holding company and at least one subsidiary handle packaging, you are a group.</p>

<p>A holding company that does not handle packaging itself with only one subsidiary that does, is not a group.</p>

<h3>Licensors or pub chains</h3>

<p>You can find an explanation of what a licensor and pub operating business is in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/871/regulation/38/made" rel="external">regulations</a>.</p>

<p>The type of packaging relevant to your business includes packaging or packaging materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with your trademark</li>
  <li>around goods that carry your trademark</li>
  <li>members must buy from the head organisation or a business specified by the head organisation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Register as a packaging producer</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>By 7 April every year you must register or be registered with your environmental regulator.</p>
</div>

<p>You can either join a compliance scheme or register yourself in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://npwd.environment-agency.gov.uk/" rel="external">National Packaging Waste Database</a> (<abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr>).</p>

<p>A compliance scheme will register you with the correct environmental regulator, get evidence of your compliance and submit the <abbr title="certificate of compliance">CoC</abbr> each year.</p>

<p>If you register yourself you will be responsible for registering, getting evidence of compliance and submitting the <abbr title="certificate of compliance">CoC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Small packaging producer status</h3>

<p>You are classed as a small producer if you have a turnover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>between £2 million and £5 million</li>
  <li>of less than £2 million but you are part of a company group that has an obligation</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Small-producers">step 1</a> to find out how to register as a small producer.</p>

<h3>Join a compliance scheme</h3>

<p>Select an approved compliance scheme from the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://npwd.environment-agency.gov.uk/PackagingPublicRegisterLinks.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fdefault.aspx" rel="external">public register</a>. You will need to pay a fee and follow the scheme’s instructions.</p>

<p>Check the compliance scheme timescales and make sure you provide the correct information about your company and packaging handled.</p>

<h3>Register yourself</h3>

<p>You need to register with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#ER">environmental regulator</a> where your registered head office or main place of business is based.</p>

<p>To submit a registration you must be an ‘approved person’. This is a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>director or company secretary</li>
  <li>company partner</li>
  <li>sole trader</li>
</ul>

<p>To get access to <abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr> you need to complete and return an authorised signatory form. Contact your <a class="govuk-link" href="#ER">environmental regulator</a> to get a form. Once returned and accepted <abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr> will issue a login.</p>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-delegation-of-approvedappropriate-person">delegation of approved or appropriate person form</a> if you want to delegate your function to another person. Sign the form and send it to your environmental regulator.</p>

<p>Log in and fill in the registration form in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://npwd.environment-agency.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If you have registered before, your information is copied into your new registration. You will need to check it and make any necessary amendments.</p>

<h3>Information you need to enter into <abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr>
</h3>

<h3>Step 1: contact details and business information</h3>

<p>Provide your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered office information and any main site address where your packaging activities happen or where you collate your packaging data</li>
  <li>Standard Industrial Classification <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007" rel="external">(<abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr>) code</a>
</li>
  <li>turnover (last set of audited accounts)</li>
  <li>status – small producer, subsidiary, holding company or licensor</li>
</ul>

<p>Small producers can register as a small producer in one of two ways.</p>

<p>Option 1: use the allocation method. This obligation is based on turnover. Calculate this obligation by multiplying turnover in millions of pounds (to the nearest £10,000) by 35 tonnes.</p>

<p>Option 2: register as a packaging producer. This obligation is based on weight of packaging handled in the previous year.</p>

<p>Groups can register:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as one group – the holding company can do this even if it is not a packaging producer</li>
  <li>individually by subsidiary</li>
  <li>as a combination of individual subsidiaries and the holding company</li>
</ul>

<p>Subsidiary details you need to include are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>company registration numbers</li>
  <li>contact details, including addresses</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007" rel="external"><abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr> code</a></li>
  <li>turnovers</li>
  <li>main packaging activities of each subsidiary</li>
  <li>whether any subsidiary is a small producer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: packaging data</h3>

<p>You must describe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your main packaging activity, for example, sell packaged goods</li>
  <li>any secondary packaging activities, for example, import packaging</li>
  <li>how you worked out how much packaging you handled in the previous year</li>
</ul>

<p>You must enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount (in whole tonnes) of packaging you supply to the next stage in the packaging chain or sell to the end user</li>
  <li>any packaging you import and any packaging around goods you import</li>
  <li>materials you or another company exports for which you have auditable records</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>packaging that’s been used before unless its imported</li>
  <li>processed waste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: review your recycling obligation</h3>

<p><abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr> automatically generates your obligation from the data you entered into the tables. If you do not fill out the tables correctly you will have the wrong target. Follow the instructions in <abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr> carefully.</p>

<p>Small producers must review their obligation calculated on the turnover and main material handled entered.</p>

<p>Correct any data inconsistencies and then submit.</p>

<p>To find out how the producer obligation is calculated see <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/871/schedule/2/made" rel="external">Schedule 2 of the Packaging Waste Regulations 2007</a>.</p>

</table>

<p>The recycling factor, which is multiplied by turnover to calculate the obligation for small producers (allocation method), has increased to 35 tonnes.</p>

<p>There is no recovery obligation for 2022. The targets are only for recycling. This means there is no accreditation for recovery operators for 2022. This is based on the proposals in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.defra.gov.uk/environmental-quality/consultation-on-reforming-the-uk-packaging-produce/" rel="external">2019 consultation</a> and the EU directive on packaging and packing waste.</p>

<p>You should report other materials not listed in the table as normal in the data form. They will now form part of the ‘general recycling’ process.</p>

<h3>Step 4: upload supporting information</h3>

<h3>Consumer information obligations</h3>

<p>If your main activity is selling packaged goods, you must give your customers information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>return and collection systems they can use</li>
  <li>their role in reusing and recycling packaging and packaging waste</li>
  <li>what recycling symbols on packaging mean</li>
  <li>how to get copies of waste strategy guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>You must upload an explanation on how you will achieve this.</p>

<h3>Small producer</h3>

<p>You must upload proof of turnover or audited accounts if you chose the allocation method.</p>

<h2>Packaging producer charges</h2>

<p>You cannot pay online. You must pay by cheque, BACS or credit or debit card.</p>

<p>The charges if you register yourself are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>producer: £776</li>
  <li>small producer: £562</li>
</ul>

<p>You can register a group as a small producer if the group of companies has a combined turnover under £5 million. Where the holding company itself is a small producer, but the whole group turnover is greater than £5 million, the holding company must register as a producer.</p>

<p>Group: £776 plus these subsidiary charges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£180 each for the first 4 subsidiaries</li>
  <li>£90 each for the next 5 to 20 subsidiaries</li>
  <li>£45 for any further subsidiaries</li>
  <li>no charge for a small producer subsidiary using the allocation method</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compliance scheme fee</h3>

<p>When you join a compliance scheme, it must pass on your registration fee to the appropriate regulator. The scheme’s charges are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>single company: £564</li>
  <li>small producer: £345</li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme can register a group as a small producer if the group of companies has a combined turnover under £5 million. Where the holding company itself is a small producer, but the whole group turnover is greater than £5 million, the holding company must be registered as a producer.</p>

<p>Group: £564 plus these subsidiary charges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£180 each for the first 4 subsidiaries</li>
  <li>£90 each for the next 5 to 20 subsidiaries</li>
  <li>£45 for any further subsidiaries</li>
  <li>no charge for a small producer subsidiary using the allocation method</li>
</ul>

<h3>Late fees</h3>

<p>If you register with a compliance scheme after the registration deadline you will have to pay an additional late fee of £110.</p>

<h3>Resubmission fee</h3>

<p>If you need to update your information during the registration year there is no charge for making a minor change. If you need to correct your obligation or packaging handling data, for example following an inspection by your environmental regulator, the charge is £220 for each resubmission where there is a change to the obligation.</p>

<h3>Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>There are different charges, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#NIEA">Northern Ireland Environment Agency</a>.</p>

<h3>Business changes</h3>

<p>Tell your environmental regulator within 28 days if a change to your business means the information you supplied in your registration needs updating.</p>

<h3>Cancel registration</h3>

<p>You need to immediately cancel your direct registration if you become a member of a producer compliance scheme or stop being a producer.</p>

<h3>Financial difficulties</h3>

<p>Tell your environmental regulator immediately if your business has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a winding up order, or a resolution for voluntary wind-up</li>
  <li>entered insolvency, receivership or administration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Comply with your registration</h2>

<p>Once registered you must meet your obligations. If you joined a compliance scheme it takes on your legal responsibility to meet the recycling obligation and submit the <abbr title="certificate of compliance">CoC</abbr>. You must give the scheme correct information and accurate data.</p>

<h3>Obtain evidence</h3>

<p>You must get evidence of waste packaging recycling equivalent to the weight of your obligation from <a class="govuk-link" href="http://npwd.environment-agency.gov.uk/PublicRegister.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fPackagingPublicRegisterLinks.aspx%3fReturnUrl%3d%252fdefault.aspx" rel="external">accredited reprocessors and exporters</a>.</p>

<p>The accredited reprocessors and exporters (or yourself if you are accredited) can issue electronic packaging recycling notes (<abbr title="electronic packaging recycling notes">ePRNs</abbr>) and electronic packaging export recycling notes (<abbr title="electronic packaging export recycling notes">ePERNs</abbr>) for the waste packaging they recycle.</p>

<p>Small producers must obtain <abbr title="electronic packaging recycling notes">ePRNs</abbr> for the main packaging material handled.</p>

<p>If you recycle packaging waste your own business handled or supplied, you must still obtain an <abbr title="electronic packaging recycling note">ePRN</abbr> or <abbr title="electronic packaging export recycling note">ePERN</abbr> from accredited reprocessors and exporters.</p>

<p>You cannot use <abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr> to carry out financial transactions for evidence notes. It does record and track <abbr title="electronic packaging recycling note">ePRN</abbr> or <abbr title="electronic packaging export recycling notes">ePERNs</abbr> credited to your account, and shows the balance of your obligation for which you still need evidence.</p>

<h3>Submit a <abbr title="certificate of compliance">CoC</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr> generates <abbr title="certificate of compliance">CoC</abbr> for directly registered producers. It will say whether your obligation has been met. Your authorised person must check it is correct, then log in to <abbr title="National Packaging Waste Database">NPWD</abbr> to sign it off and submit it.</p>

<p>The deadline for submission is 31 January immediately following the end of the calendar compliance year.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/packaging-producer-responsibility-monitoring-plan-2021">Environment Agency monitoring plan</a> explains how they will check businesses are complying each year.</p>

<h2>Penalties</h2>

<p>If you fail to meet your legal obligations, or provide false or misleading information, you may face prosecution under criminal law. In England, Scotland and Wales there are also civil penalties. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fixed penalty fines for minor offences</li>
  <li>higher fines for more serious offences</li>
  <li>an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agencys-use-of-civil-sanctions">enforcement undertaking</a>: an offer, formally accepted by your environmental regulator, that redresses the impact of your non-compliance – these apply to offences after 6 April 2010 in England and after 15 July 2010 in Wales</li>
</ul>

<h2>Public register and disclosure</h2>

<p>By law, your environmental regulator must put your details on a public register. This will include the name and address of your registered office or your main place of business for each site.</p>

<p>If you think any information you provide about your business is confidential, contact your environmental regulator and explain why. Under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 your environmental regulator may have a legal duty to disclose information about you if asked.</p>
