</li>
</ol>

<h3>Before you move goods between Northern Ireland and the EU</h3>

<p>If you plan to move goods between Northern Ireland and the EU, you’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration/selling-or-moving-goods-in-northern-ireland#tell-hmrc">tell HMRC</a> so that you are identified as trading under the Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>

<p>You’ll need to add an ‘XI’ prefix before your UK VAT number on all documentation when communicating with EU customers or suppliers. This is so VAT can be accounted for correctly on transactions between Northern Ireland and the EU using rules on intra-EU movements.</p>

<h3>Moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h3>

<p>There are no changes to how qualifying Northern Ireland goods move directly from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. There are some changes for qualifying goods moved indirectly through Ireland.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This qualifying goods regime forms part of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-qualifying-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-the-rest-of-the-uk">phased approach to the implementation of ‘unfettered access’</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Bringing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain and from countries outside of both the EU and the UK</h3>

<p>You will need to make declarations and pay any tariffs due when bringing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain or from countries outside of the EU and the UK.</p>

<p>There are a number of options available to make sure the right tariff outcome is applied on the goods you bring into Northern Ireland. Before moving your goods, you should consider which of these options is most suitable for your business.</p>

<h2>Making declarations</h2>

<h3>Sending goods from Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>If you’re a UK-based business sending goods from Northern Ireland, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-what-declarations-need-to-be-made-for-goods-you-send-from-the-uk-from-1-january-2021#NI" class="govuk-link">check what declarations may need to be made</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-goods-meet-the-rules-of-origin">Check the origin of your goods</a>. This may allow an EU or UK preferential arrangement to apply.</p>

<p>For goods moving into Northern Ireland from outside EU and UK, EU Tariff Rate Quotas will not be available. More guidance will be published as soon as possible for goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</p>
</div>

<p>Use the commodity code to check what duties and measures may apply to your goods. This will show if you need any extra documentation or measure codes on your declaration.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Where a commodity code indicates the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/additional-commodity-code" class="govuk-link">need for a meursing code</a> within the EU tariff, this will need to be included on all Northern Ireland declarations.</p>
</div>
