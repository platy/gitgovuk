<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, there will be no changes in how qualifying Northern Ireland goods move directly from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. There will be some changes for qualifying goods moved indirectly through Ireland.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This qualifying goods regime forms part of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-qualifying-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-the-rest-of-the-uk">phased approach to the implementation of ‘unfettered access’</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Bringing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain and from outside the EU</h3>

<p>The Northern Ireland Protocol explains that goods from Great Britain (not deemed to be at risk of leaving the UK customs territory) will not pay any tariffs. However, goods ‘at risk’ of entering the EU’s single market will pay EU tariffs.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you’ll need to make declarations and may need to pay tariffs when bringing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain or from outside the EU.</p>

<p>There are a number of options available to avoid paying tariffs when moving goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Before moving your goods, you should consider which of these options is most suitable for your business.</p>

<p>When bringing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, you’ll pay no duty if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claiming-preferential-rates-of-duty-between-the-uk-and-eu-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">claim a preferential rate of duty</a> under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and EU</li>
  <li>authorised under the UK Trader Scheme and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-declare-goods-you-bring-into-northern-ireland-not-at-risk-of-moving-to-the-eu" class="govuk-link">declare that your goods are not ‘at risk’ of onward movement to the EU</a>
</li>
  <li>eligible to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-waiver-for-duty-on-goods-that-you-bring-to-northern-ireland-from-great-britain" class="govuk-link">claim a waiver</a> on the duty up to specified limits</li>
</ul>

<p>When bringing goods into Northern Ireland from outside the UK and the EU, you’ll pay the UK duty rate if your goods are not ‘at risk’ of onward movement to the EU.</p>

<h2>Before you move goods</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>If you plan to move goods between Northern Ireland and non-EU countries (including Great Britain), you’ll <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori#if-you-move-goods-to-or-from-northern-ireland">need an EORI number that starts with XI</a>.</p>

<p>If you import goods into Northern Ireland and want to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-declare-goods-you-bring-into-northern-ireland-not-at-risk-of-moving-to-the-eu" class="govuk-link">declare your goods not ‘at risk’</a> so that EU duty will not be payable on those goods, you’ll need to apply for an authorisation for the UK Trader Scheme. You can also check how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claiming-preferential-rates-of-duty-between-the-uk-and-eu-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">claim preferential rates of duty on goods covered in the UK’s deal with the EU</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you import goods regularly, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-type-of-account-to-apply-for-to-defer-duty-payments-when-you-import-goods#apply-for-a-duty-deferment-account-to-use-in-northern-ireland-from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">apply for a duty deferment account to delay paying most customs charges</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To understand any duty or other measures that apply to your goods, you’ll <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports" class="govuk-link">need to find the right commodity code</a> to make your customs declaration when you bring goods in or send goods out of Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>Making declarations</h2>

<h3>Sending goods from Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>If you’re a UK-based business sending goods from Northern Ireland, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-what-declarations-need-to-be-made-for-goods-you-send-from-the-uk-from-1-january-2021#NI" class="govuk-link">check what declarations may need to be made</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-goods-meet-the-rules-of-origin" class="govuk-link">Check the origin of your goods</a>. This may allow an EU or UK preferential arrangement to apply.</p>

<p>For goods moving into Northern Ireland from outside EU and UK, EU Tariff Rate Quotas will not be available. More guidance will be published as soon as possible for goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Use the commodity code to check what duties and measures may apply to your goods. This will show if you need any extra documentation or measure codes on your declaration.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Where a commodity code indicates the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/additional-commodity-code" class="govuk-link">need for a meursing code</a> within the EU tariff, this will need to be included on all Northern Ireland declarations.</p>
</div>

<h3>Moving goods between Northern Ireland and the EU</h3>

<p>Declarations are not needed for any goods.</p>

<p>However, if you’re liable to submit Intrastat Supplementary Declarations, you can continue to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-60-intrastat-general-guide/notice-60-intrastat-general-guide#from-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">submit Intrastat declarations for goods you move between Northern Ireland and the EU</a>.</p>
