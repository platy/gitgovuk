<h2>About UK Health Security Agency</h2>
<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) exists to protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing, and to reduce health inequalities. It is an executive agency of the government, sponsored by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health-and-social-care">Department of Health and Social Care</a> (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>). <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency">Find out more about <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and its work</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england/about#responsibilities">responsibilities</a> include running the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/surgical-site-infection-surveillance-service-ssiss">Surgical Site Infection Surveillance Service (<abbr title="surgical site infection surveillance service">SSISS</abbr>)</a>. This has been set up to help hospitals monitor surgical patients and record the numbers that develop a wound infection after surgery. The work of the <abbr title="surgical site infection surveillance service">SSISS</abbr> enables hospitals to see how their infection rates compare with other hospitals and help them make improvements.</p>

<p>This privacy notice explains what personal information about patients at risk of surgical wound infections is shared with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> by hospitals across England. It also explains what <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> does with this information, how we protect it, how long we keep it, who we sometimes share it with, what your rights are, and how you can find out more or raise a concern.</p>

<h2>Data controller</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is the data controller for the personal information we collect, store and use to fulfil our remit. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is listed under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z5571792" rel="external"><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s registration</a> with the Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>). You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukhsa-privacy-notice/ukhsa-privacy-notice"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> general privacy notice</a>.</p>

<h2>The information hospitals share with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>
</h2>
<p>Hospitals are required by law to participate in surgical site infection surveillance for several categories of orthopaedic surgery, including hip and knee replacement. They are also encouraged to undertake voluntary surveillance in other categories of surgical procedures such as heart and bowel surgery.</p>

<p>If you have undergone one of these types of surgery, your personal information is shared with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> by your hospital as part of this surveillance.</p>

<p>The information shared includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your full name</li>
  <li>your date of birth</li>
  <li>your sex</li>
  <li>your NHS number</li>
  <li>information about your risk of developing an infection, including your general level of health before the operation and information about your operation</li>
  <li>information about any infections following your surgery</li>
</ul>

<p>Your hospital may also share your email address and mobile phone number, or those for someone acting on your behalf, with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. This is so we can send you a wound healing questionnaire by email or text for you to complete and return to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. These questionnaires provide us with valuable information on any infections which may develop after your discharge from hospital.</p>

<h2>How <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> uses your information</h2>

<p>Your personal information shared with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is used to calculate rates of surgical wound infections for different types of operation for hospitals across England. This allows hospitals to see how their infection rates compare with other hospitals and how they change over time. This information helps them make improvements to reduce their infection rates.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> needs to use personal information to check the quality and accuracy of the information we receive from your hospital and make sure we don’t count patients more than once. We also use this information to link to NHS records to see if you are readmitted to hospital after your surgery, the reasons why, the treatments and procedures you receive for your infection, and whether you have other risk factors for surgical wound infection such as diabetes. We obtain this information from NHS Digital, which provides information and technology services to the health and care system, and collects information on all hospital admissions, outpatient appointments and A&amp;E visits in England. You can find out more in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/privacy-and-cookies" rel="external">Privacy and cookies – NHS Digital</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, we also link the records we receive to mortality records to see if any patients with a surgical infection die from this infection. We obtain this information from NHS Digital and the Office for National Statistics, which is responsible for collecting information on all deaths in England.</p>

<p>The records may also be linked to microbiology laboratory data held by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to look at further clinical information on infections patients may have. We may also link your information to the records held by other clinical registries which contain more detailed clinical information such as the types of surgical implants used.</p>

<p>To help the NHS reduce the number of surgical wound infections, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> produces confidential local reports for hospitals concerning their own patients every 3 months. We also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surgical-site-infections-ssi-surveillance-nhs-hospitals-in-england">publish a report</a> each year showing the rates across the country and how these are changing. No information that could identify you will ever be included in the reports published by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>How <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> protects your information</h2>

<p>Your personal information is protected by us in a number of ways. It is stored on computer systems that have been tested to make sure they are secure and which are kept up-to-date to protect them from viruses and hacking. Where we share your personal information with your hospital and other organisations, we only ever do so using secure computer systems or encrypted email.</p>

<p>Your information used by the <abbr title="surgical site infection surveillance service">SSISS</abbr> can only be seen by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> staff who have been specifically trained to protect your privacy. Strong controls are in place to make sure all these staff can only see the minimum amount of personal information they need to do their job.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, we only use your information in a form that does not directly identify you. We do need to use your name, date of birth and NHS number to link together your surgical records with other information about you, including if you are readmitted to hospital for further treatment and your outcomes. For most of the analyses we then do to monitor surgical site infections, we use information that does not directly identify you. For example, we replace your name and NHS number with pseudonyms (that is, codes that do not include information that identifies you) and substitute your date of birth with age in years. We do this to help protect your confidentiality.</p>

<p>We hold your information in the UK only.</p>

<p>No information that could identify you will ever be published by us.</p>

<h2>How long <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> keeps your information</h2>

<p>The personal information of surgical patients is kept by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> for 25 years after which time we review it to decide if we need to continue to keep it. If we don’t, then we securely delete your personal information. The exception to this is your phone number and email address, which we only keep for 12 months and then securely delete. If we need to keep your personal information for longer than this, then we will revise this privacy notice to explain the reasons why.</p>

<p>This information needs to be kept for this long because infections and related complications that affect patients’ health can sometimes take many years to develop after surgery. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> needs to keep personal information so that it can link to other hospital and mortality records in the future.</p>

<p>Patients’ phone numbers and email addresses are only used for the specific purpose of sending automated emails or texts containing the post-discharge wound healing questionnaire, which is why they are only kept for 12 months and then securely deleted.</p>

<h2>Does <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> share your information with anyone else?</h2>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> may share the personal information of surgical patients with researchers outside <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>This only happens if the researcher has approval from a medical ethics committee and special permission from the Health Research Authority’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/about-us/committees-and-services/confidentiality-advisory-group/" rel="external">Confidentiality Advisory Group</a>. This group provides independent advice to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care on whether the use of confidential patient information is in the interests of patients and the public. This is known as ‘Section 251’ approval. The part of the law that applies here is section 251 of the National Health Service Act 2006 and the associated Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> never shares personal information with researchers without these approvals.</p>

<p>Sharing information helps scientists to make recommendations for hospitals to reduce their infection rates, but patients can opt out of their personal information being shared by PHE with other researchers if they choose.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/your-nhs-data-matters/" rel="external">Further information and details on how to register an opt out choice</a> can be found online.</p>

<p>On this web page you will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>see what is meant by confidential patient information</li>
  <li>find examples of when confidential patient information is used for individual care and examples of when it is used for purposes beyond individual care</li>
  <li>find out more about the benefits of sharing data</li>
  <li>understand more about who uses the data</li>
  <li>find out how your data is protected</li>
  <li>be able to access the system to view, set or change your opt out setting</li>
  <li>find the contact telephone number if you want to know any more or to set or change your opt out by phone</li>
  <li>see the situations where the opt out will not apply</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will ensure that no personal information about you will be shared with other researchers if you register a choice to opt out.</p>

<h2>Surgical site infection surveillance and the law</h2>

<p>The law on protecting personal information, known as the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and the Data Protection Act 2018, allows <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to use the surgical wound infection information shared with us by hospitals.</p>

<p>The sections of the law that apply here are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Article 6(1)(e) ‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller’</li>
  <li>UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Article 9(2)(i) ‘processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of healthcare’</li>
  <li>Data Protection Act Schedule 1 Part 1 (3) ‘public health’</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the <abbr title="surgical site infection surveillance service">SSISS</abbr>, we may need to use your confidential patient information such as your surgical records without asking directly for your consent.</p>

<p>We have ‘section 251’ approval from the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to do this for the purpose of diagnosing, recognising trends, controlling and preventing, and monitoring and managing risks to health such as surgical wound infections.</p>

<p>The part of the law that applies here is section 251 of the National Health Service Act 2006 and regulation 3(3) of the associated Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002.</p>
