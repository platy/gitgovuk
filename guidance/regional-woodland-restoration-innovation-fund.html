<p>Most of our woodlands have been managed in the past to provide timber and fuel. This management has shaped and maintained the habitats that support the plants and animals enjoyed and valued by society today. Presently around 41% of our woodlands are not actively managed and this can have a negative impact on the biodiversity they contain.</p>

<p>The aim of the Woods into Management (<abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr>) Forestry Innovation Funds, as part of governmentâ€™s Nature for Climate Fund, is to encourage and broaden innovation in forestry. Through the Regional Woodland Restoration Innovation Funds, the FC are looking to support proposals that will bring increased areas of woodland into active management and improve their ecological condition. Up to Â£4.5 million will be made available via the Regional Woodland Restoration Innovation Funds between Spring 2022 and March 2025 to support innovative project work. 
The threats faced by our woodlands and the biodiversity they support are numerous and varied. They include a lack of adaptation to climate change, diseases such as ash dieback and Phytophthora ramorum, insect pests, over grazing by deer and ring barking by grey squirrels. In addition, in many parts of the country there are opportunities to restore conifer and hardwood plantations on ancient woodland sites and to improve the condition of woodland SSSIâ€™s. The intensity and impact of each of these threats varies across the country.</p>

<p>To reflect this variation, the Invitation to Apply for each of the five Regional Woodland Restoration Innovation Funds has been developed through collaboration with the regional Forest and Woodland Advisory Committees (FWACâ€™s) to identify priority areas for activity across the regions. The funds are open to a range of organisations including (but not limited to) forestry businesses, conservation groups and membership organisations who are in a position to help owners better manage their existing woodlands.</p>

<h3>Regional Woodland Restoration Innovation Funds: How to apply webinar</h3>
<p>The Forestry Commission will be hosting a webinar event at 13:00 on Thursday 24 March.</p>

<p>During this session, applicants will have the opportunity to ask questions about the Forestry Innovation Fund application and evaluation processes.</p>

<p>If you would like to attend the Regional Woodland Restoration Innovation Fund: How to apply webinar, please email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:wimfif@forestrycommission.gov.uk">wimfif@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>About the North West and West Midlands Innovation Fund</h2>

<p>The aim of Woods into Management (<abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr>), as part of governmentâ€™s Nature for Climate Fund, is to encourage and broaden innovation in forestry that results in improved ecological condition of existing woodlands and the role they play in climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>

<p>There are 226,000ha of woodland in the West Midlands and North West. Innovative thinking is required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve biodiversity</li>
  <li>conserve threatened species</li>
  <li>address problems caused by invasive species, pests and diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>Urgent action is required to help increase the flow of public benefits from our woodlands to society. Active management is needed to help woodland adapt to climate change and ensure carbon stocks are protected in the long term. As well as helping to mitigate climate change, well managed, accessible, woodlands provide benefits to the health and wellbeing of communities and improve the quality of water and air.</p>

<p>The Forest and Woodland Advisory Committees of the North West and West Midlands have identified the following barriers to increasing woodland management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an absence of easy first steps for owners to understand their woodland and its values (value = social, environmental, tax, timber income), implement management and operational plans designed to improve habitat condition and resilience to climate change. Many owners are not foresters and may not be inclined to engage with either the Forestry Commission or traditional forestry businesses</li>
  <li>fragmented ownership of woodlands. Many woodlands are small and it is not always viable to actively manage these woods in isolation</li>
  <li>an absence of skills and awareness, site specific information on woodland condition, woodland inventory and the value of standing timber makes it difficult for some owners to identify management objectives for their woodlands</li>
  <li>tree heath issues and catastrophic windblow events. Woods heavily damaged by tree pests and diseases such as Ash dieback and windblow events such as Storm Arwen make woodland management challenging and viewed as unviable by landowners</li>
</ul>

<p>To help remove these barriers, the Forestry Commission is launching an innovation fund to which applications are invited. Projects should target novel ways in removing the barriers outlined. We invite applications from woodland management companies, conversation bodies, organisations and consortiums in a position to accelerate the restoration and improvement of woodlands in the West Midlands and North West England. We are particularly interested in proposals that can demonstrate scalability and would encourage applicants to explore how their ideas could be rolled out at a regional or national level to maximise impact.</p>

<p>We encourage applications for projects that result in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more native woodlands with long term, UK Forestry Standard compliant, woodland management plans, and associated activity focused on habitat improvement and maintenance and security of carbon stocks</li>
  <li>a conveyor belt of new felling licence applications and applications to Countryside Stewardship woodland improvement, woodland infrastructure and woodland tree health grant schemes</li>
  <li>restored Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites and appropriate improvements to the conservation status of woodland SSSIâ€™s</li>
  <li>more native woodlands containing suitable species and provenances tolerant to climate change, ensuring long term carbon sequestration potential is maintained or improved</li>
  <li>demystifying woodland management to non-expert owners</li>
  <li>new incomes streams to help owners maintain and improve woodlands in the long term</li>
  <li>the creation of new woodland management partnerships</li>
  <li>market pull for locally sourced timber products</li>
  <li>restoration of temperate rainforests along Englandâ€™s Atlantic fringe</li>
</ul>

<p>We are particularly interested in proposals that bring woodlands into management and report on what barriers were overcome to do this, including barriers that remain. We welcome bids that demonstrate collaborative working amongst businesses, private and public woodland owners. We would also encourage bids from membership organisations and Local Authorities to support projects that will bring more woods into active management through engagement with members and local community groups. Urban forestry projects are eligible for funding and might explore how benefits including recreation, education, biodiversity and new timber markets have potential to incentivise woodland management practices and improve ecological condition. Projects may incorporate an element of original research but must include significant practical application.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, we will work with applicants to target and develop new ways of writing and approving UKFS compliant management plans. Where possible organisations including the Small Woods Association, the Woodland Trust and the Forestry Commission will share information on woodland ownership and type together with lessons learned from previous woodland management initiatives.</p>

<h2>About the South East and London Innovation Fund</h2>

<p>The aim of the Woods into Management (<abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr>) workstream, as part of governmentâ€™s Nature for Climate Fund, is to encourage and broaden innovation in forestry that results in improved ecological condition of existing woodlands and the role they play in climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>

<p>Action is required to help increase the public benefits from our woodlands to society. Active management is needed to help woodland adapt to climate change and ensure carbon stocks are protected in the long term. As well as helping to mitigate climate change, well managed, accessible, woodlands provide benefits to the health and wellbeing of communities and improve the quality of water and air.</p>

<p>Through this fund we aim to increase the extent and amount of woodland management that will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve biodiversity</li>
  <li>conserve threatened species</li>
  <li>address problems caused by invasive species, pests, and diseases</li>
</ul>

<h3>Woodland Management in South East England</h3>
<p>There are 325,000ha of woodland in the SE &amp; London. 43% is ancient woodland and more than 80% of the woodland is broadleaved, including traditional systems such as coppice and coppice with standards.</p>

<p>There are thousands of woodland owners across the SE &amp; London, from a wide variety of backgrounds and with varied understanding of sustainable management. Lots of the woodlands are fragmented in the landscape, with some woodlands subdivided into multiple ownership.</p>

<p>According to official figures, only around half of the woodlands in the South East are in active management and evidence shows that lack of management results in a loss of benefits including biodiversity. A lack of woodland management has been a long-standing issue, so we are seeking innovative ways that create a step change.</p>

<h2>Barriers to Woodland Management in South East England</h2>
<p>The Forest and Woodland Advisory Committees of the South East and London have identified the following barriers to increasing woodland management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fragmented ownership of woodlands. Many woodlands are small, and it is not always viable to actively manage these woods in isolation</li>
  <li>a lack of knowledge about the ownership and management of woodlands that the Forestry Commission is not in contact with</li>
  <li>a lack of easy guidance and support that takes inexperienced woodland owners on a journey from awareness of woodland management benefits to delivering operations within a UKFS compliant management plan</li>
  <li>an absence of skills and awareness, site specific information on woodland condition, woodland inventory and the value of standing timber makes it difficult for some owners to identify management objectives for their woodlands</li>
</ul>

<h3>What projects will the Innovation Fund support?</h3>
<p>Applications are invited for projects that target novel ways to remove the barriers outlined. We invite applications from woodland management companies, conservation bodies, organisations and consortiums in a position to accelerate the restoration and improvement of woodlands in the South East and London. We are particularly interested in proposals that can demonstrate scalability and would encourage applicants to explore how their ideas could be rolled out at a regional or national level to maximise impact.</p>

<p>We encourage applications for projects that result in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more native woodlands with long term, UK Forestry Standard compliant, woodland management plans, and associated activity focused on habitat improvement and maintenance and security of carbon stocks</li>
  <li>a pipeline of new felling licence applications and applications to Countryside Stewardship woodland improvement, woodland infrastructure and woodland tree health grant schemes</li>
  <li>restored Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites and appropriate improvements to the conservation status of woodland SSSIâ€™s</li>
  <li>demystifying woodland management to non-expert owners</li>
  <li>more native woodlands containing suitable species and provenances tolerant to climate change, ensuring long term carbon sequestration potential is maintained or improved</li>
  <li>new income streams to help owners maintain and improve woodlands in the long term</li>
  <li>fewer gaps in local, regional and national timber supply chains</li>
</ul>

<p>We are particularly interested in proposals that bring woodlands into management and report on what barriers were overcome to do this or barriers that remain. We welcome bids that demonstrate collaborative working amongst businesses, private and public woodland owners. We would also encourage bids from membership organisations and Local Authorities to support projects that will bring more woods into active management through engagement with members and local community groups.

<h2>About the Yorkshire and North East Innovation Fund</h2>

<p>The Yorkshire and North East Area contains over 228,000 hectares of woodland ranging from important habitat networks of Ancient Woodlands through to large productive conifer forests. The area also contains a significant amount of woodland area which is not under active management which could deliver greater benefits. The aim of this fund is to support innovation in the woodlands across Yorkshire and North East in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve biodiversity</li>
  <li>conserve threatened species</li>
  <li>increase resilience and address problems caused by invasive species, pests and diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>Urgent action is required to help increase the flow of public benefits from our woodlands to society. Active management can play a key role in helping woodlands adapt to climate change and ensure carbon stocks are protected in the long term. As well as helping to mitigate climate change, well managed, accessible, woodlands provide benefits to the health and well-being of communities and can improve the quality of water and air.</p>

<p>The Forest and Woodland Advisory Committees of Yorkshire and The Humber and the North East have identified the following key barriers to increasing woodland management activity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limited contact between woodland owners and the sector giving rise to a potential lack of understanding of the value, benefits and route to active woodland management. This is exacerbated by a lack of an easily understood pathway to develop and deliver management plans</li>
  <li>fragmented ownership of woodlands. Many woodlands are small and it is not always viable to actively manage these woods in isolation</li>
  <li>an absence of skills and awareness, site specific information on woodland condition, woodland inventory and the value of standing timber makes it difficult for some owners to identify appropriate management objectives for their woodlands</li>
  <li>tree heath issues and catastrophic windblow events. Woods heavily damaged by tree pests and diseases such as Ash dieback and windblow events such as Storm Arwen make woodland management challenging and viewed as unviable by landowners</li>
</ul>

<p>To help remove these barriers, the Forestry Commission is launching an innovation fund to which applications are invited. Projects should target novel ways in removing the barriers outlined. We invite applications from woodland management companies, conservation bodies, organisations and consortiums in a position to accelerate the restoration and improvement of woodlands in the Yorkshire and North East area. We are particularly interested in proposals that can demonstrate scalability and would encourage applicants to explore how their ideas could be rolled out at a regional or national level to maximise impact.</p>

<p>We encourage applications for projects that result in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more native woodlands with long term, UK Forestry Standard compliant, woodland management plans, and associated activity focused on habitat and biosecurity improvements, in addition to the maintenance and security of carbon stocks</li>
  <li>an increase in active management through felling licence applications and applications to Countryside Stewardship woodland improvement, woodland infrastructure and woodland tree health grant schemes</li>
  <li>increase in the restoration of the area Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites and appropriate improvements to the conservation status of woodland SSSIâ€™s particularly focused at known clusters/networks of ancient woodlands</li>
  <li>increased resilience of native woodlands looking to ensure suitable species, diversity and provenances tolerant to climate change, to deliver long term carbon sequestration</li>
  <li>educating and supporting non-expert owners on the basic principles of woodland management including the benefits of active management and how to obtain appropriate professional support</li>
  <li>new income streams to help owners manage, maintain and improve woodlands in the long term</li>
</ul>

<p>We are particularly interested in proposals that bring woodlands into management and report on barriers overcome as well as providing details of those which remain. We welcome bids that demonstrate collaborative working amongst businesses, private and public woodland owners. We would also encourage bids from membership organisations and Local Authorities to support projects that will bring more woods into active management through engagement with members and local community groups. Urban forestry projects are eligible for funding and might explore how benefits including recreation, education, biodiversity and new timber markets have potential to incentivise woodland management practices and improve ecological condition. Projects may incorporate an element of original research but must include significant practical application.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, we will work with applicants to target and develop new ways of writing and approving UKFS compliant management plans. Where possible organisations will share information on woodland ownership and type together with lessons learned from previous woodland management initiatives. Any proposal, if proposed for certain geographical areas of Yorkshire and the North East, should seek to complement and be separate to the work of existing Woodland / Forest partnerships that are carrying out Landowner Engagement work or similar for either woodland management or woodland creation.</p>

<h2>About the East of England and East Midlands Innovation Fund</h2>

<p>The aim of the Woods into Management (<abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr>) Forestry Innovation Funds, as part of governmentâ€™s Nature for Climate Fund, is to encourage and broaden innovation in forestry that results in improved ecological condition of existing woodlands and the role they play in climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>

<p>There are 256,000ha of woodland in the East of England and the East Midlands, 108,000ha of which is currently unmanaged. Innovative thinking is required to increase the amount of woodland in active management, and to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve biodiversity</li>
  <li>conserve threatened species</li>
  <li>address problems caused by invasive species, pests, and diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>Urgent action is required to help increase the public benefits that our woodlands provide to society. Active management is needed to help woodlands adapt to climate change and ensure carbon stocks are protected in the long term. As well as helping to mitigate climate change, well managed, accessible, woodlands provide benefits to the health and wellbeing of communities and improve the quality of water and air.</p>

<p>The Forest and Woodland Advisory Committees of the East of England and the East Midlands have identified the following barriers to increasing woodland management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>many woods are fragmented. Challenges include managing at economic scale, landowner motivations and collaboration. Many woods, both in long term ownership, and a growing number in new ownership are unknown to the Forestry Commission</li>
  <li>there is a forestry and conservation skills and knowledge gap across many disciplines including planning, assessment and practical management of woods</li>
  <li>woodlands are being impacted by climate change, with the East of England particularly affected, being one of the driest regions of the UK. This amplifies the issues around long-term resilience of our woods, and the need to manage the impact of tree pests (including mammals) and diseases, often going unrecognized as an issue, or the management considered a burden to landowners</li>
  <li>a lack of awareness of the potential natural capital benefits of sustainably managed woodland. For example, income from Carbon Credits and Offsetting, Biodiversity Net Gain and Water Quality Credits</li>
  <li>control of deer and grey squirrel populations to allow natural regeneration, and to protect woodland habitats and biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<p>To help remove these barriers, the Forestry Commission is launching an innovation fund to which applications are invited. Projects should target novel ways in in which to remove the barriers outlined. Where possible, applicants should demonstrate that their proposals have the potential to be economically viable, enabling foresters to adopt innovative practices without the need for continued grant funding. We invite applications from organisations, businesses and individuals who are able to lead locally in delivering the restoration and improvement of woodlands in the East of England and the East Midlands. We are particularly interested in proposals that can demonstrate scalability and would encourage applicants to explore how their ideas could be rolled out at a regional or national level to maximise impact.</p>

<p>We encourage applications for projects that result in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collaborative action at a landscape scale to identify and address common objectives and promote a coherent approach to the management of fragmented areas of woodland</li>
  <li>improving the ecological condition of woodlands, in particular Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites (PAWS) and Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW) which are under threat from factors such as climate change, pests and diseases and under-management</li>
  <li>an improved understanding amongst landowners of the natural capital benefits of sustainably managed woodlands. In particular, we would encourage projects that will better enable landowners to realise these benefits</li>
  <li>the development of new woodland management partnerships and models that make full use of connections with developers or investors requiring Biodiversity Net Gain, or Carbon and Water Quality Credits</li>
  <li>an improved understanding of priority areas for woodland management in the East and East Midlands, and implementation of strategies designed to improve management in these areas</li>
  <li>new woodland finance models that can be used to make previously undermanaged sites economically viable to manage</li>
  <li>market pull for venison and improvements to the management of deer and grey squirrel populations</li>
  <li>market pull for locally sourced timber and coppice products</li>
  <li>collaborative action around rewetting woodlands for climate change resilience and biodiversity</li>
  <li>upskilling both woodland management planning (including assessment of condition) and practical skills</li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome bids that demonstrate collaborative working amongst businesses, private woodland owners and public woodland owners. Projects may incorporate an element of original research but must demonstrate the potential for practical application. We are particularly interested in proposals which bring together data sets that evaluate the existing barriers to bring woodlands into management. Scoping projects could also focus on areas such as priority mapping, the vulnerability of woodlands to disease, condition surveys and monitoring mammal density populations to identify regional opportunities and priorities for targeted action. Applicants should ensure that proposals conform to the UKFS.</p>

<p>Membership organisations and Local Authorities are eligible for funding to support projects that will bring more woods into active management through engagement with members and local community groups. We would also encourage applications from academics and consultants with innovative solutions to overcoming historic barriers to woodland management.</p>

<h2>About the South West Innovation Fund</h2>

<p>The aim of the Woods into Management (<abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr>) workstream, as part of governmentâ€™s Nature for Climate Fund, is to encourage and broaden innovation in forestry that results in improved ecological condition of existing woodlands and the role they play in climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>

<p>There are some 250,000ha of woodland in the South West nearly half of which is classed as â€˜undermanagedâ€™. This Regional Woodland Restoration Innovation Fund is an opportunity to bring innovative thinking to help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve biodiversity</li>
  <li>conserve threatened species</li>
  <li>address problems caused by invasive species, pests and diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>Urgent action is required to help increase the flow of public benefits from our woodlands to society. Active management is needed to help woodland adapt to climate change and ensure carbon stocks are protected in the long term. As well as helping to mitigate climate change, well managed, accessible woodlands provide benefits to the health and wellbeing of communities, improve the quality of water and air, as well as restoring habitats and also being able to produce timber and non-timber products.</p>

<p>The Forest and Woodland Advisory Committee of the South West has identified the following key barriers to increasing woodland management activity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an absence of easy first steps for owners to understand their woodland and its values implement management and operational plans designed to improve habitat condition and resilience to climate change. Many owners are not foresters and may not be inclined to engage with either the Forestry Commission or traditional forestry businesses</li>
  <li>fragmented ownership of woodlands. Many woodlands are small and difficult to access, and it is not always viable to actively manage these woods in isolation</li>
  <li>an absence of skills and awareness, site specific information on woodland condition, woodland inventory and the value of standing timber and other natural capital values makes it difficult for some owners to identify management objectives for their woodlands</li>
  <li>tree heath issues and catastrophic windblow events. Woods heavily damaged by tree pests and diseases such as Ash dieback and windblow events such as Storm Eunice make woodland management challenging and viewed as unviable by landowners</li>
</ul>

<p>To help remove these barriers, the Forestry Commission has launched an innovation fund to which applications are invited. Projects should target novel ways in removing the three barriers outlined. Where possible, applicants should demonstrate that their proposals have the potential to be economically viable, enabling foresters to adopt innovative practices without the need for continued grant funding. We invite applications from woodland management companies, conversation bodies, organisations and consortiums in a position to accelerate the restoration and improvement of woodlands in South West England. We are particularly interested in proposals that can demonstrate scalability and would encourage applicants to explore how their ideas could be rolled out at a regional or national level to maximise impact.</p>

<p>We encourage applications for projects that result in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more woodlands with long term, UK Forestry Standard compliant, woodland management plans, and associated activity focused on habitat improvement and maintenance and security of carbon stocks</li>
  <li>a conveyor belt of new felling licence applications and applications to Countryside Stewardship woodland improvement, woodland infrastructure and woodland tree health grant schemes</li>
  <li>restored Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites and appropriate improvements to the conservation status of woodland SSSIâ€™s</li>
  <li>more woodlands containing suitable species and provenances tolerant to climate change, ensuring long term carbon sequestration potential is maintained or improved</li>
  <li>improving woodland biodiversity, providing water flow and quality benefits, helping soil conservation and the minimising damage to sites</li>
  <li>the development of new woodland management partnerships and models that make full use of connections with developers or investors requiring Biodiversity Net Gain, or Carbon and Water Quality Credits</li>
  <li>market pull for locally sourced timber and coppice products</li>
  <li>new incomes streams to help owners maintain and improve woodlands in the long term</li>
  <li>demystifying woodland management to non-expert owners</li>
  <li>restoration of temperate rainforests along Englandâ€™s Atlantic fringe</li>
</ul>

<p>We are particularly interested in proposals that bring woodlands into management and report on what barriers were overcome to do this or barriers that remain. We would also encourage bids from membership organisations and Local Authorities to support projects that will bring more woods into active management through engagement with members and local community groups. We welcome bids that demonstrate collaborative working amongst businesses, private and public woodland owners. Projects may incorporate an element of original research but must include significant practical application.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, we will work with applicants to target and develop new ways of writing and approving UKFS compliant management plans. Where possible organisations including the Small Woods Association, the Woodland Trust and the Forestry Commission will share information on woodland ownership and type together with lessons learned from previous woodland management initiatives.</p>
