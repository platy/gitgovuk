<h2>Stay up to date</h2>
<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Liechtenstein.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This information is about living in Liechtenstein. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Liechtenstein</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’ve been living in Liechtenstein since before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare in Liechtenstein will stay the same for as long as you remain resident.</p>

<p>This guidance explains what you need to do in Liechtenstein depending on your circumstances.</p>

<p>You must have health insurance to live in Liechtenstein. There are 3 insurers that offer state mandatory insurance.</p>

<p>Even with insurance, healthcare is not free. You usually need to pay part of the cost of the treatment that you receive.</p>

<p>There’s only one hospital in Liechtenstein in the capital city Vaduz.</p>

<p>The Liechtenstein government has arrangements with some hospitals in other countries such as Austria and Switzerland. Patients who need specialist treatment can be transferred there.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Liechtenstein healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state mandatory health insurance</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued S1 form with one of the insurance funds (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Liechtenstein’ below)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Liechtenstein</h2>

<p>If you are planning on moving to Liechtenstein, see the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-liechtenstein">Living in Liechtenstein</a> for more information about visa and residency requirements.</p>

<p>You need to get a resident permit to live in Liechtenstein and you need to take out health insurance. There are 3 insurance providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.concordia.li/en.html">Concordia</a></li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.fkb.li/" class="govuk-link">FKB</a> (website in German)</li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.swica.ch/" class="govuk-link">SWICA</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Your dependants need to register for health insurance individually.</p>

<p>You can also buy extra insurance that covers you for additional costs such as dental care, or healthcare from a provider that is not contracted with the Office of Public Health.</p>

<p>Once you’re a resident you may also be entitled to a Liechtenstein European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) for travel.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Liechtenstein before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you’ve been living in Liechtenstein since before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare in Liechtenstein will stay the same for as long as you remain resident.</p>

<p>This means you may also be entitled to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Liechtenstein <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK</li>
  <li>a UK S1 if you start drawing a UK State Pension (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Liechtenstein’ below).</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to register for healthcare</h3>
<p>Once you have a residence permit, you can choose a health insurance provider to join.</p>

<p>Once you’ve registered, your insurance provider will give you a health insurance card (Versicherungskarte). Show this when you visit a doctor.</p>

<p>When <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://lkv.li/">choosing a GP</a> (website in German), make sure they provide state-funded healthcare.</p>

<p>Go to the GP practice to register and bring your health insurance card.</p>

<h3>How to access healthcare services</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/switzerland-and-liechtenstein-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">Find your nearest hospital or clinic</a> on this GOV.UK webpage.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>You’ll need to pay an annual cost (premium) for your insurance cover, as well as payments towards any healthcare you access (co-payments).</p>

<p>The insurance companies calculate their own premiums, but they’re usually about 300 to 320 Swiss francs per month.</p>

<p>There’s no premium to pay for children until they’re 16. From the ages of 16 to 20 the premium is half price.</p>

<p>If you’re working, half of your premium will be covered by your employer.</p>

<p>Your co-payments depend on your age and other circumstances.</p>

<p>You do not need to pay co-payments if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re under 21</li>
  <li>you’re chronically ill</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re 21 to 64 you must pay the first 500 Swiss francs of any healthcare that year (this is your ‘excess’ or ‘deductible’). After that you pay 20% of your healthcare costs until you reach a maximum of 1,400 Swiss francs that year.</p>

<p>If you’re over 65, you pay the same excess and then 10% of any healthcare costs after this until you reach a maximum of 950 Swiss francs that year.</p>

<p>Usually healthcare providers send a bill directly to your insurance company, who will then work out how much you need to pay. If you have reached your maximum then the insurance company will pay.</p>

<p>All dental care in Liechtenstein is private and must be paid for in full.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Liechtenstein temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to another European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<h3>Healthcare for posted workers who started before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Liechtenstein using a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or an S1 if Liechtenstein agrees to let the posting continue.</p>

<p>If Liechtenstein does not agree to let the posting continue, you may need to do one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>join a local healthcare scheme</li>
  <li>cover the cost of your healthcare with private health insurance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Healthcare for posted workers moving to Liechtenstein</h3>

<p>You may need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>join a local healthcare scheme</li>
  <li>cover the cost of your healthcare with private health insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 in Liechtenstein</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance if you have an S1 as a ‘posted worker’ (see ‘If your UK employer has sent you to Liechtenstein temporarily (‘posted workers’)’ above).</p>

<p>If you’ve been living in Liechtenstein since before 1 January 2021, you may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a Liechtenstein resident and receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Liechtenstein system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare on the same basis as  a Liechtenstein citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
  <li>access to the NHS in England when you’re visiting</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Liechtenstein than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<p>If you’re entitled to an S1 form as a dependant of a State Pensioner, your health cover will be cancelled once you begin claiming your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You will be sent a new S1 form to your registered address from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services. You must register this form to ensure continuation of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>You are responsible for informing NHS Overseas Healthcare Services if you change your address or your circumstances change.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to get an S1</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension or another qualifying exportable benefit, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services (see contact details above).</p>

<h3>How to use an S1 in Liechtenstein</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 with the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.llv.li/inhalt/1908/amtsstellen/amt-fur-gesundheit">National Office of Health</a> (Amt fur Gesundheit, website in German) and then join a health insurance provider.</p>

<p>When registering your S1 you may be asked for a copy of your S1 and some ID.</p>

<p>The address is:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Äulestrasse 51
<br>9490 Vaduz
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Once registered, you will be given a medical card. This will show you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Liechtenstein citizen.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you are experiencing delays registering your S1 with local authorities and require emergency or urgent treatment, contact the Overseas Healthcare Services on 0044 191 218 1999.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> if you have a registered S1</h3>

<p>You need to get a new UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> that’s valid for travel from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/ehic" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Apply now for your new <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> on the NHS website</a></p>

<h2>Studying in Liechtenstein</h2>
<p>If you were already in Liechtenstein before 1 January 2021 because you study there, you need to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/ehic">apply for a new UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> entitles you to medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period in Liechtenstein.</p>

<h3>Students moving to Liechtenstein from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>You cannot use a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to get healthcare in Liechtenstein.</p>

<p>You should either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take out private travel insurance with healthcare coverage</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-liechtenstein" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> to get state health insurance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Because the NHS is a residency-based system, under NHS rules UK nationals who move abroad on a permanent basis may lose their entitlement to free NHS healthcare.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national and move to the EU, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK unless you have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, PRC or S2 to show your healthcare costs are funded by the EU country in which you now live, or another exemption applies.</p>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK war pensioners</li>
  <li>UK government employees</li>
  <li>UK nationals living in the EU on or before 31 December 2020, once they have a registered, UK-issued S1</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about using the NHS when you no longer live in the UK (see ‘UK nationals who no longer live in the UK’ in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-eu-and-efta-citizens-visiting-the-uk">Healthcare for visitors to the UK from the EU</a>).</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
