<h4>Other additional codes</h4>

<p>Other additional codes are needed where a prohibition or restriction, Anti-dumping measure or specific Tariff Preference measure applies to the goods. Tariff Preference does not always need an additional code to be declared in box 33(3).</p>

<p>These additional codes are shown as Tariff measures in the UK Trade Tariff.</p>

<p>Gross mass is the total weight of the goods you have declared in box 31, including packaging. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-imports-and-community-transport-inwards/uk-trade-tariff-imports-and-community-transport-inwards#box-35--gross-mass" class="govuk-link">Gross mass</a> excludes the weight of containers and any other transport equipment.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to pay a reduced about of duty if your goods if they’re covered by the free trade agreement with the EU</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-imports-and-community-transport-inwards/uk-trade-tariff-imports-and-community-transport-inwards#box-36--preference" class="govuk-link">box 36 of UK Trade Tariff: imports and community transport inwards</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Box 37 – Customs Procedure Code (<abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr>)</h3>

The code you use must be for release to free circulation.</p>

<ul>

<h3>Box 42 – Item price</h3>

<ul>
  <li>t-shirts (£100)</li>
  <li>shoes (£100)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Box 43 – Valuation method</h3>

<h3>Box 44(2) – Additional information statements and document codes</h3>

  <li>preference certificates and quantities where required</li>
  <li>veterinary or health certificates and quantities where required</li>

<h3>Box 45 – Adjustment</h3>
