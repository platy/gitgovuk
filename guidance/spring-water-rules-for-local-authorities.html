<p>This guide is for local authorities in England who need to register a producer’s premises to bottle spring water from a spring or borehole in their area.</p>

<p>If you’re a producer, read guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/spring-water-how-to-produce-and-label">producing spring water</a>.</p>

<p>For local authorities in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wales or Northern Ireland, you should read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/document/guidance-on-natural-mineral-water-spring-water-and-bottled-drinking-water-regulations-in-wales-and-northern-ireland" rel="external">Food Standards Agency guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>Scotland, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/contact-us" rel="external">Food Standards Scotland</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>What counts as spring water</h2>

<p>A product can only be described as spring water if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it comes from an underground water source that’s tapped at a natural or drilled exit</li>
  <li>it’s free of parasites and bacteria that cause disease</li>
  <li>the source is protected from pollution</li>
</ul>

<p>Bottling must take place at the spring or borehole.</p>

<p>Producers can sell spring water directly to consumers in, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bottles</li>
  <li>tetra packs and cartons</li>
  <li>water coolers</li>
  <li>pouches</li>
</ul>

<p>They do not have to state the composition on the label (although many producers choose to do so).</p>

<p>There are no forbidden treatments, but producers must <a class="govuk-link" href="#treatments">follow rules for 5 particular treatments</a> if they choose to use them.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/compare-types-of-bottled-water">different types of bottled water</a> if you’re not sure which type you’re dealing with.</p>

<p>You can also check what types of water are exempt from the rules.</p>
</div>

<h2>Steps to register a producer’s premises for spring water</h2>

<p>Bottled water producers may ask you to register their premises to produce spring water from a spring or borehole that sits in your local authority area.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to register the premises for spring water.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check the producer has got a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/water-management-apply-for-a-water-abstraction-or-impoundment-licence">water abstraction licence</a>. They must have this before they can take water from the spring.<br><br>
</li>
  <li>Make sure the producer has <a class="govuk-link" href="#evidence">gathered the evidence</a> to prove the water is safe and meets standards.<br><br>
</li>
  <li>Make sure the producer knows the conditions they must meet when <a class="govuk-link" href="#exploiting">exploiting the spring</a>.<br><br>
</li>
  <li>Check if the producer wants to use <a class="govuk-link" href="#treatments">treatments</a> on the water. There are 5 treatments where they must follow certain rules.<br><br>
</li>
  <li>Make sure the producer knows the <a class="govuk-link" href="#labelling">rules for labelling</a>.<br><br>
</li>
  <li>When you’re satisfied the producer meets the rules, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/food-business-registration">register the producer’s business as a food establishment</a> for spring water. If you need to refuse, you should put this in writing to the producer.
<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>After registration, check the producer is complying with rules for <a class="govuk-link" href="#exploiting">exploiting the spring</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#treatments">treatments</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#labelling">labelling</a>.</p>

<h2>Evidence the producer must gather to get premises registered</h2>

<p>The producer must test the water and make sure it complies with limits for <a class="govuk-link" href="#chemical">chemical</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#pesticide">pesticide</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#microbiological">microbiological</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#radioactive">radioactive</a> substances.</p>

<p>For initial checks for registering a premises, you do not need to collect samples of the water. You can rely on the laboratory reports that the producer sends to you.</p>

<p>But make sure that the producer has used a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/search-accredited-organisations" rel="external">UKAS accredited laboratory</a> that uses recognised scientific methods for testing spring water.</p>

<p>For <a class="govuk-link" href="#ongoing-checks">ongoing checks after registration</a>, you’ll need to carry out your own checks.</p>

<h3>Chemicals limits</h3>
<p>The producer must test their water to make sure it complies with the following limits.</p>

<p>If there’s any risk of the water exceeding these limits, you must check that the producer has sampled and tested the water. However, they do not need to analyse a sample of the water if you’re both satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the equipment in contact with the spring water is certified not to leak acrylamide, epichlorohydrin and vinyl chloride into the water</li>
  <li>they’ve not used any flocculants containing these 3 chemicals</li>
</ul>

<p>The producer can demonstrate to you that any material used to come into contact with the water does not leak these chemicals into the water, by providing either a manufacturer’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relevant certificate of conformity</li>
  <li>declaration of conformity</li>
  <li>declaration of performance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pesticide limits</h3>

<h3>Microbiological limits</h3>

<p>The water must be free of parasites and bacteria that cause disease.</p>

<p>The producer must test their water to make sure it complies with the following limits.</p>

<p>For initial testing, the producer must have taken samples both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at source</li>
  <li>within the first 12 hours after bottling - keeping the water at between -1°C  and 4°C before they send it to the laboratory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Radioactive limits</h3>

<p>The producer must test the water to make sure it complies with the following limits.</p>

<p>For the initial testing, the producer should take samples at the point they bottle.</p>

<h2>Check the producer understands the rules for exploiting the spring</h2>

<p>Make sure the producer is aware of the rules they must follow once they’re registered and start to exploit the spring.</p>

<h3>Rules for protecting the water at source</h3>

<p>The producer must make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any equipment they’ll use to collect the water, such as a pump, preserves the properties of the water and avoids contamination</li>
  <li>the source or borehole will be protected against pollution</li>
  <li>pipes and reservoirs are made from materials suitable for water, to food grade standards, and built to prevent any chemical, physio-chemical or microbiological change to the water</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules for bottling or using containers</h3>

<p>The producer’s bottling plant must be based at the spring.</p>

<p>The producer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/food-hygiene-for-your-business-0" rel="external">hygiene requirements</a> when they bottle the water</li>
  <li>bottle in containers with lids, to avoid tampering or contamination</li>
  <li>use containers that are made to food-grade standards to avoid adverse effects on the microbiological and chemical characteristics of the water</li>
</ul>

<p>If the water becomes polluted at any stage, the producer must stop bottling from the spring until they’ve removed the cause of the pollution.</p>

<h3>Rules for transporting the water</h3>

<p>Check that producers will transport their spring water from their plant in bottles or containers that the final customer will use.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is if, on or before 17 July 1980, they were transporting water from the spring to a bottling plant further away, in containers not intended for the final customer. If they were, they can continue transporting using the same containers now.</p>

<h2>Check and authorise treatments</h2>

<p>A producer may want to use treatments to make their spring water taste better or to make it comply with the rules.</p>

<p>They may use any treatment for spring water. Producers must follow certain rules if they use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="#oxidation">authorised ozone-enriched air oxidation technique</a>
</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#alumina">activated alumina</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ozone-enriched air oxidation treatment</h3>

<p>Producers can use ozone-enriched air oxidation to separate compounds of iron, manganese, sulphur and arsenic from the water if they occur naturally at source.</p>

<p>They can only use this treatment if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before they start, they’ve met the conditions for <a class="govuk-link" href="#exploiting">exploiting the spring</a>
</li>
  <li>the treatment does not have an accidental disinfectant effect</li>
  <li>the treatment does not alter the mineral, chemical and microbial composition of the water (apart from iron, sulphur and manganese)</li>
  <li>it does not leave residues in the water that could be a risk to public health</li>
</ul>

<p>Any residues caused by this treatment should not exceed the following maximum limits.</p>

<table>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bromoform</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You must authorise the producer to use this treatment. Before authorising, you should examine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the proposed method</li>
  <li>the proposed place of treatment</li>
  <li>samples for analysis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Authorised activated alumina treatment</h3>

<p>Producers can only treat their water with activated alumina if :</p>

<ul>
  <li>they’re aiming to remove fluoride</li>
  <li>they follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2010/115/contents" rel="external">technical rules</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Any residues released into the water as a result of removing fluoride must be as low as possible and should not be a risk to public health.</p>

<p>You must check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the treatment does not have an accidental disinfectant effect</li>
  <li>you give permission at least 3 months before the producer starts this treatment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules for labelling</h2>

<p>Before you register the premises, check the producer understands the rules for labelling.</p>

<p>After registration, you’ll need to check their labels to make sure they’ve complied with the rules.</p>

<p>The producer must put the following on their labelling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#type">type of product</a> (also known as the sales description)</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#name">name of spring and place where the water is exploited</a></li>
  <li>details of any <a class="govuk-link" href="#labelozone">ozone-enriched air treatment</a>, if they’ve used this treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>They can also put a <a class="govuk-link" href="#trade">trade description</a> (sometimes known as the brand name) if they want to but it’s not legally required.</p>

<h3>Type of product (sales description)</h3>

<p>The words ‘spring water’ must appear on the labelling. This describes the product and is known as the sales description.</p>

<p>The producer cannot sell it as any other type of water, such as natural mineral water.</p>

<h3>Name of spring and place where spring is exploited</h3>

<p>On the label, the producer must put the name of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spring - if the spring does not have a name, they must give it one</li>
  <li>place where the spring is exploited - for example, they could use the town or village name, or the postcode where the bottling plant is</li>
</ul>

<h3>If they’ve used an ozone-enriched air oxidation treatment</h3>

<p>If they’ve used an authorised ozone-enriched air oxidation technique on their spring water, they must put the words ‘water subjected to an authorised ozone-enriched air oxidation technique’ on their labelling.</p>

<p>If they’ve used any other treatments, they do not need to put any wording on the label about them.</p>

<h3>Trade description (optional brand name)</h3>

<p>The ‘trade description’ is also known as the brand name. For example, Highland Spring, Pure Life or Harrogate.</p>

<p>The producer does not have to use a trade description for their spring water. But if they choose to have one they must follow the trade description rules set out in this section.</p>

<h3>Trade description: using the town or place as a trade description</h3>

<p>The producer can use the town or place as the trade description as long as the spring is located there.</p>

<p>They must not use a misleading place as their trade description. For example, they cannot name their water after a town in Somerset if their spring is in Devon.</p>

<p>If they use the town or place as their trade description then they must put the name of the spring elsewhere on the label.</p>

<p>And if they use the name of the spring as their trade description, then they must put the town or place elsewhere on the label.</p>

<h3>Trade description: using a trade description that’s different from the name of the spring and place of exploitation</h3>

<p>If producers want to do this, they must make the font for the name of the spring and place at least one and a half times the height and width of the largest of the letters used for their trade description.</p>

<h3>Trade description: producers cannot have more than one</h3>

<p>The producer must sell all spring water from the same spring or borehole using only one trade description. They cannot sell it under a second name.</p>

<p>For example, if they already sell ‘ABC Natural Mineral Water’ they’re not allowed to sell a new batch from the same spring using the name ‘DEF Natural Mineral Water’.</p>

<p>The only exception is if they want to sell their water to a retailer who will add their own branding to the labels, such as a supermarket, hotel, stadium, museum, venue or cafe.</p>

<p>The best practice way to do this is for the producer to sell the water with both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the producer’s own trade description</li>
  <li>the retailer’s own logo</li>
</ul>

<p>If they do this, the retailer’s logo does not count as a second brand.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they can choose to not have their own trade description, remove their own logo and sell the water with the retailer’s logo instead. They can do this as long as the retailer’s logo is clearly separate from the sales description ‘spring water’.</p>

<h3>Spring water as an ingredient in soft drinks</h3>

<p>The producer can list the term ‘spring water’ as an ingredient on labelling if they’re producing soft drinks.</p>

<p>However, they can only do this if their water complies with the spring water rules in this guide, at the point they add the first extra ingredient, such as flavouring, to their spring water.</p>

<h2>Ongoing checks</h2>

<p>After you’ve registered a business to produce spring water, you must continue to monitor the water for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ongoing-chemical">chemical limits</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ongoing-microbiological">microbiological limits</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ongoing-indicators">indicators</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ongoing-radioactive">radioactive limits</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ongoing-other-limits">other limits</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike initial tests, you must take samples yourself and get a laboratory to check them.</p>

<p>When you test the water, take samples at the point the water is bottled.</p>

<h2>Ongoing checks: chemical limits</h2>

<p>Check the water for chemical limits at least once a year.</p>

<p>Your testing must give a representative picture of the safety and quality of the water.</p>

<p>So if you decide to analyse samples exactly once a year, take samples approximately the same time each year, rather than different months.</p>

<p>If you choose to test more often than once a year, take samples that are spread out evenly throughout the year. For example, take approximately every 3 months or 6 months</p>

<p>When the water is tested, it should not exceed the limits set out in this table.</p>

<ul>
  <li>gross alpha activity</li>
  <li>gross beta activity</li>
  <li>activity concentration for a single radionuclide</li>
  <li>activity concentration for more than one radionuclides</li>

<h3>How to calculate the indicative dose determination</h3>

<p>Follow these steps to work out the indicative dose determination for the water.</p>

<ol>
  <li>From your own records, make a note of the observed activity concentration of tritium and each radionuclide present in your spring water in becquerels per litre. This is known as the ‘ci(obs)’.</li>
  <li>Find the <a class="govuk-link" href="#derived-activity">derived activity concentration in the table</a> for tritium and each radionuclide present in your spring water in becquerels per litre. This is known as the ‘ci(der)’.</li>
  <li>For each individual radionuclide, divide the ci(obs) by the ci(der). This is also shown here in a formula.
<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p><br>
4. When you have a divided value for each radionuclide, add them all together. This will give you the indicative dose determination. <br>
5. Check your results in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-to-do">indicative dose determination table</a> to find out what action is needed.</p>

<h3>When you can reduce your monitoring of indicative dose</h3>

<p>You can reduce the monitoring of indicative dose for the water if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re satisfied that only naturally occurring radionuclides are present in the water</li>
  <li>your last indicative dose determination result was 1 or below</li>
  <li>you’re satisfied that reducing monitoring will not increase any risk to human health</li>
</ul>

<p>If you reduce monitoring, but a change takes place that you believe is likely to influence the concentration of radionuclides in the water, you must choose a <a class="govuk-link" href="#screening">screening strategy</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on the results of your screening strategy, you can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry on with reduced monitoring</li>
  <li>continue monitoring using the <a class="govuk-link" href="#volume-table">volume table</a> to work out how many samples a year you need to take</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remedial action for radon, tritium and indicative dose</h3>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify the cause</li>
  <li>decide whether the levels pose a risk to human health that needs action</li>
  <li>get the bottled water producer to take action to restore the quality of the water if you think this is needed to protect human health</li>
  <li>notify the general public of the risks and remedial action taken</li>
  <li>advise the general public on any extra precautionary measures that may be needed to protect human health in terms of radioactive substances</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to get a monitoring exemption for radon, tritium or indicative dose</h3>

<p>You must apply to Defra by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:bottledwater@defra.gov.uk">bottledwater@defra.gov.uk</a> for a monitoring exemption. You must apply within 3 months of deciding to not monitor.</p>

<p>Your application for an exemption must list all spring water and bottled drinking water sources in the area you’ve been monitoring.</p>

<p>Your exemption will lapse either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>after 5 years</li>
  <li>at any time the levels exceed or you have reason to believe they exceed 100 becquerels per litre</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ongoing checks: other limits</h2>

<p>You may believe or suspect that any of the following may be present in the water but have not been listed in this guide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>properties</li>
  <li>elements</li>
  <li>substances</li>
  <li>organisms</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is the case, you must take and analyse samples of the water on a case by case basis to check if any of these pose a risk to human health.</p>

<h2>Tasks a local authority can delegate</h2>

<p>A local authority can delegate the job of taking and analysing water samples to a company or other third party:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a one-off</li>
  <li>occasionally</li>
  <li>for a specific period of time</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re going to delegate testing to another party, you must follow certain rules.</p>

<p>You must explain to them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to take samples and how often</li>
  <li>method of analysis that must be used, including any minimum performance characteristics that apply to any methods of analysis</li>
  <li>how to calculate the limits detected</li>
  <li>the uncertainty of measurement percentages needed</li>
  <li>validation and documenting of the methods of analysis used</li>
  <li>use of quality management practices</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also make sure that the third party knows to tell you immediately if any limits have been exceeded during testing.</p>

<p>If limits have not been exceeded, they should give you the results within 28 days of getting them.</p>
