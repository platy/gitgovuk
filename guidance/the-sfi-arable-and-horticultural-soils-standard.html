<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the arable and horticultural soils standard of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the arable and horticultural soils standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>How the arable and horticultural soils standard will improve the environment</h2>
<p>As soils are one of the most important natural assets, the arable and horticultural soils standard is focused on improving soil health, structure, organic matter, and biology. These improvements can benefit food production. They also contribute to a range of environmental and climate change outcomes, including better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water quality</li>
  <li>climate resilience</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eligible land for the arable and horticultural soils standard</h2>

<p>You can only enter land into the arable and horticultural soils standard that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h3>Land cover</h3>
<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel on your digital maps in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-land-details-before-you-apply-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">land cover and checking your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The eligible land covers for the arable and horticultural soils standard are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arable Land</li>
  <li>Permanent Crops (only perennial crops)</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Drain/Ditch/Dyke on a boundary</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Track – natural surface</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of these eligible land covers, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h3>Land type</h3>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into the arable and horticultural soils standard if its land type is cultivated arable land. This includes land used for horticultural crops, such as field vegetables, and temporary grassland. If there are drains, ditches, dykes or tracks with a natural surface in an otherwise cultivated arable land parcel, those can be viewed as part of that land parcel’s eligible land type area.</p>

<p>Temporary grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for less than 5 consecutive years. You can choose to view this as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arable land and enter it into the arable and horticultural soils standard</li>
  <li>improved grassland and enter it into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for 5 consecutive years or more becomes classified as permanent grassland. If you enter temporary grassland into the arable and horticultural soils standard that becomes permanent grassland during the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, that land will no longer be eligible for this standard. You may want to consider entering it into the improved grassland standard instead if it is improved permanent grassland.</p>

<h2>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h2>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h3>Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h3>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as Countryside Stewardship, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h3>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> HEFER).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> HEFER will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> HEFER, you need to register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk" rel="external">HEFER portal</a>. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> HEFER by entering your Single Business Identifier (SBI). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> HEFER is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/consents/smc" rel="external">scheduled monuments</a>, as you may need consent from Historic England</li>
  <li>works in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/consent/cac" rel="external">conservation area</a> that may need consent from your local planning authority</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sites of special scientific interest</h3>

<p>If the land is a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), it is eligible for this standard, but you’ll need <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">consent from Natural England</a>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement cannot start until Natural England gives this consent. Information about when to request this consent will be published on GOV.UK before applications open.</p>

<h3>Peaty soil</h3>

<p>Land with ‘peaty soil’ is eligible for this standard. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<p>You should not complete action 3 (add organic matter) on land with peaty soil, as explained later in this section. You’ll still be paid for this area even if you do not complete action 3. This is a temporary measure until specific measures on the sustainable management of peaty soils become available.</p>

<h3>Organically farmed land</h3>

<p>To ensure value for public money, we expect that organically farmed land will be entered into the intermediate level of this standard.</p>

<h2>How the arable and horticultural soils standard works</h2>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land management actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the arable and horticultural soils standard, it cannot be selected for the other 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard where this is the case.</p>

<h3>Different levels</h3>

<p>The actions are grouped into two levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introductory</li>
  <li>intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the actions are the same in both levels. There is an additional action in the intermediate level.</p>

<p>You can select different levels for different land parcels entered into this standard. For example, you can enter one land parcel into the introductory level and another land parcel into the intermediate level.</p>

<p>An advanced level is likely to be available from 2023 and may include use of no-tillage techniques. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h3>Payment</h3>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (ha) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>
      <th scope="col">Total annual payment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Introductory</td>
      <td>£22 per ha</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
      <td>£40 per ha</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means if you enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 ha into the introductory level, your total annual payment is based on 20 ha x £22 per ha.</li>
  <li>20 ha of land into the intermediate level, your total annual payment is based on 20 ha x £40 per ha.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are paid for all the eligible hectares entered into the standard, even if the action only has to be completed on a percentage area of that land.</p>

<p>Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/getting-paid-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">payments</a>.</p>

<h3>When to complete the actions</h3>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard. This is explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<p>If your agreement starts too late for you to complete an action, for example, establishing winter cover by the start of December, you can complete it within 12 months of your agreement start date.</p>

<h3>Checking the progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h3>

<p>If we check the progress of your agreement, you’ll only be asked for evidence of what you’ve done to complete the action if it’s not clear that the aim has been achieved. The details of each action explain what evidence to keep.</p>

<p>Read the information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/checking-progress-of-your-sfi-standards-agreement">checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>.</p>

<h2>Summary of the actions</h2>

<p>The introductory level actions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>action 1: complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</li>
  <li>action 2: test soil organic matter</li>
  <li>action 3: add organic matter to all land in the standard at least once during the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>action 4: have green cover on at least 70% of land in the standard over winter</li>
</ul>

<p>The intermediate level actions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>action 1: complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</li>
  <li>action 2: test soil organic matter</li>
  <li>action 3: add organic matter to all land in the standard at least once during the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>action 4: have green cover on at least 50% of land in this level of the standard over winter and multi-species cover crops on an additional 20% of the land</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details of the actions</h3>

<p>This section gives details of the actions in the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<h2>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h2>

<h3>What to do</h3>

<p>You must complete an assessment of your soil and produce a written soil management plan covering all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<p>If you already have a written soil management plan informed by a soil assessment, you can use it to meet this action.</p>

<p>To help us improve national data on the condition of England’s soils, you’ll need to provide some information when we ask you for it as part of the soils strategy once it’s launched. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic information from your soil assessment</li>
  <li>the soil organic matter test results under action 2</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is one of the public goods that the standard is paying for and part of wider government measures in relation to our future soils strategy.</p>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about what basic information is needed and how to supply it to us.</p>

<h3>When to do it</h3>

<p>You must complete the soil assessment and produce the written soil management plan within the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You must review the soil management plan each year of your agreement, adding any new soil analysis you undertake.</p>

<h3>How to do it</h3>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You can record the soil management plan on paper or digitally. Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to assess your soils and produce a soil management plan. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h3>The action’s aim</h3>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim, which is for you to have both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessed the soil for all the land entered into the standard</li>
  <li>produced a written soil management plan</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h3>What evidence to keep</h3>

<p>You must keep a record of your soil management plan, including your soil assessment. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h2>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h2>

<h3>What to do</h3>

<p>You must make sure the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard has been tested for soil organic matter (<abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr>) within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>You can use existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results to meet this action, but they cannot be more than 5 years old.</p>

<h3>When to do it</h3>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must make sure that each land parcel entered into this standard has been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 3 years.</p>

<p>If your existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results reach 5 years old, you must retest that land parcel.</p>

<p>If you have not tested some or all of the land parcels entered into this standard for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years, you should try to do this during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If this timing is not possible because the laboratory that does your <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> tests does not have capacity, you must make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tests for these land parcels are done as soon as possible</li>
  <li>all of these land parcels have been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, you must also explain in your annual declaration why you have not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>retested land parcels for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> when existing test results reached 5 years’ old</li>
  <li>completed <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> testing during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement for land parcels not tested within the last 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to carry out this action at the same time as your other routine soil testing required in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/farming-rules-for-water-in-england">Farming Rules for Water</a>.</p>

<h3>How to do it</h3>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to sample and test soil organic matter. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h3>The action’s aim</h3>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that you have tested the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> on all the land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This will enable you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h3>What evidence to keep</h3>

<p>You must keep a record of the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h2>Action 3: Add organic matter</h2>

<h3>What to do</h3>

<p>You must add organic matter to the soil of all the land parcels entered into this standard to improve soil health. This can be any kind of organic matter. There are examples of how you could add organic matter for this action under ‘How to do it’.</p>

<p>For the introductory level, this can include sown green cover crops established for action 4 (winter cover).</p>

<p>For the intermediate level, this can include multi-species green cover established for action 4 (winter cover).</p>

<p>If your land has ‘peaty soil’, you should not complete this action on that land because adding organic matter can speed up peat decomposition. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more. If there is peaty soil, you should read the guidance about adding soil organic matter that will be published before applications open.</p>

<p>You may already know if there is peaty soil on your land. If you do not know, the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results from completing action 2 will tell you. You’ll still be paid for this area in this standard, even if you cannot complete the action.</p>

<h3>When to do it</h3>

<p>You must do this on every land parcel entered into this standard at least once during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This could be done as part of your crop rotation.</p>

<p>By the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have added organic matter to the soil of all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<h3>How to do it</h3>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>Examples of how you could add organic matter to your soil include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applying manure or other organic matter</li>
  <li>using green manures, catch crops or cover crops</li>
  <li>chopping and leaving, or incorporating, straw</li>
  <li>introducing grass or herbal leys into an arable rotation</li>
  <li>including legume species or legume rick mixes in rotations</li>
</ul>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to add organic matter. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h3>The action’s aim</h3>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that, by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, your soil organic matter levels have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been maintained at a healthy level if this is already the case</li>
  <li>increased to healthy levels</li>
</ul>

<p>This will improve the long-term productivity of your soil, and also brings benefits for soil biodiversity and carbon storage.</p>

<h3>What evidence to keep</h3>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h2>Action 4: Winter cover</h2>

<h3>What to do</h3>

<p>For the introductory level, over winter you must have a well-established green cover on at least 70% of the land entered into this level of the standard. 
Green cover is any crop or vegetation that covers bare soil to protect it over the winter. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>autumn-sown crops such as winter cereals, linseed and oilseed rape</li>
  <li>a quick-growing cover crop</li>
  <li>leaving weedy stubbles that give sufficient cover to protect the soil</li>
</ul>

<p>For the intermediate level, over winter you must have: 
* a well-established green cover on at least 50% of the land entered into this level of the standard 
* multi-species cover crops on at least an additional 20% of the land entered into this level of the standard</p>

<p>Multi-species cover crops are a mix of brassicas, legumes, grasses and cereals, grown together on the same area of land. You can choose the plant types and the proportion of each plant type that works for your farm.</p>

<p>A well-established green cover is where there is leafy vegetation, that’s sufficiently well grown to protect the soil, from the start of December. There should be minimal bare soil. If this is not possible, for example, due to prolonged adverse weather, you must let the RPA know. Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/checking-progress-of-your-sfi-standards-agreement">checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>.</p>

<p>For both introductory and intermediate levels, you must not leave any land bare over winter if it is at high risk of erosion or run-off.</p>

<p>Existing areas of multi-species cover crops and temporary grassland can be used for this action.</p>

<p>For this action, you can also use areas of green cover or multi-species cover crops on your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2-metre or 1-metre cross compliance buffers required under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-1-establishment-of-buffer-strips-along-watercourses">GAEC 1</a>
</li>
  <li>2-metre cross compliance green cover requirement under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-7a-boundaries">GAEC 7a</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use a quick-growing cover crop as green cover, you do not have to destroy it.</p>

<p>You can graze the winter cover, but there still needs to be a well-established green cover over winter. You should not use or allow grazing to destroy the cover crop in these months.</p>

<h3>When to do it</h3>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have a well-established green cover (and multi-species cover at intermediate level) by the start of December.</p>

<p>You must keep the green cover (and multi-species cover) until the end of February, unless you’re establishing an early-sown spring crop.</p>

<p>Where conditions allow, you may destroy both types of cover before the end of February to establish an early-sown spring crop. You must not do this more than 6 weeks before you establish that spring crop.</p>

<h3>How to do it</h3>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK on how to establish green cover. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h3>The action’s aim</h3>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there is a well-established cover across all of the land used for this action over winter.</p>

<p>This will help protect the soil surface. It will also provide root growth that maintains soil structure, supports soil biology and minimises nutrient leaching, soil erosion and run-off.</p>

<h3>What evidence to keep</h3>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>
