<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Bulgaria.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-bulgaria" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts</a></p>
</div>

<p>This information is about living in Bulgaria. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<p>State healthcare in Bulgaria is not completely free. You may need to pay something for most treatments and services. How much you pay depends on how your healthcare is funded.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Bulgarian healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying state health insurance contributions through their Bulgarian employer</li>
  <li>paying state health insurance contributions independently if you’re self-employed or financially independent</li>
  <li>taking out private health insurance</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with Bulgaria’s National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Bulgaria</h2>
<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bulgaria#visas-and-residency" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> if you intend to stay in Bulgaria for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>When you apply for residency, you’ll be asked to show a proof of health insurance.</p>

<p>As a resident, you can pay national health insurance contributions. This will entitle you to cheaper state healthcare, so you’ll only pay a small patient fee rather than the full amount.</p>

<p>If you’re employed or self-employed, you’ll pay monthly national health insurance contributions to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nap.bg/page?id=315" rel="external">National Revenue Agency (NRA, website in Bulgarian)</a></p>

<p>If you’re not working, you can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay your contributions to the NRA by registering as a self-insured person</li>
  <li>get private health insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be entitled to a Bulgarian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bulgaria#visas-and-residency">register as a resident</a> to pay healthcare contributions in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>If you’re working for a Bulgarian employer, they’ll arrange for monthly national health insurance payments to the NRA to come out of your salary before you’re paid.</p>

<p>You’ll need to register at your local <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nap.bg/page?id=546">NRA office</a> (website in Bulgarian) if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>self-employed</li>
  <li>registering as a self-insured person</li>
  <li>unemployed</li>
</ul>

<p>Check with your local NRA office what documents you’ll need to provide when you register.</p>

<p>Once you’re making contributions, you can register with a local GP. Make sure they’re registered with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF).</p>

<p>Your GP will help you get a National Health Insurance Card. Show this whenever you see a doctor.</p>

<p>You’ll need a referral from your GP to see a specialist. If you don’t have a referral, you’ll have to pay the full price of the visit or treatment.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>If you’re employed, your monthly national health insurance contributions are 8% of your salary  before tax, split between your employer and you. Your employer pays 4.8% and you pay 3.2%. Your contribution will be taken out of your salary before you’re paid.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, your national insurance contributions will be 8% of your taxable income.</p>

<p>If you do not have a taxable income – for example, you receive a pension – you’ll pay a small health insurance contribution. This is set from the national minimum wage.</p>

<p>Emergency healthcare is free in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>You’ll have to pay a small amount for most other medical services, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>from 2.90 Bulgarian leva for a visit to your GP</li>
  <li>from 5.80 Bulgarian leva per day for the first 10 days you’re in hospital</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people may be exempt from paying healthcare costs, for example if you’ve just given birth or are having cancer treatment. You’ll need an exemption certificate from your doctor.</p>

<p>There are no set costs for dental treatment.</p>

<p>You’ll have to pay for all prescribed medicine. How much you’ll pay depends on the medicine.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Bulgaria temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Bulgaria using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Bulgaria</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-bulgaria" class="govuk-link">Bulgarian resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Bulgaria before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it with the Bulgarian National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF).</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants  will be entitled to healthcare in Bulgaria on the same basis as a Bulgarian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Bulgaria than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Bulgaria</h3>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it with your <a href="http://www.en.nhif.bg/page/rhif" rel="external" class="govuk-link">local NHIF office</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll get a certificate to show that you’ve registered your S1 form. Bring this with you whenever you visit a doctor or get medical treatment.</p>

<p>This will show you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Bulgarian citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Bulgaria</h2>
<p>You can use an <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period. You can use your card in Bulgaria and when you travel to other EU countries.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
