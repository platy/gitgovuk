<h2>Access to Lyme disease testing services</h2>

<p>This guidance on the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease is intended for healthcare professionals in the UK. Patients concerned about possible Lyme infection should consult an appropriate healthcare professional, for example their GP, in the first instance.</p>

<p>Health professionals wishing to discuss a possible case or ascertain local arrangements for testing should contact a local Infection specialist (such as a consultant in infectious diseases or microbiology).</p>

<p>NHS testing for Lyme disease is available through local service providers and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl">Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (<abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>)</a> at UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) Porton where ISO15189 accredited confirmatory testing is also provided. <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> also provides a testing service for neurological Lyme disease.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> provides medical and laboratory specialist services to the NHS and other healthcare providers, covering advice and diagnosis of a wide range of unusual bacterial and viral infections, including Lyme disease.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> continuously updates its methods and will make further information on Lyme disease diagnostic testing available as it arises.</p>

<h2>Management of individuals without symptoms following a tick bite</h2>

<p>Diagnostic testing is not recommended for individuals who do not develop any symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease after a tick bite.</p>

<p>Some commercial companies offer services to test removed ticks for the presence of the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> does not provide such tick-testing services. The results of such tests should not be used to inform diagnosis or treatment.  A positive result does not mean that the infected tick will have passed on the bacteria – there are many factors that determine whether Lyme disease results from the bite of an infected tick. A negative result may not be technically valid and could give false assurance, as it does not exclude the possibility that another tick elsewhere on the body has been missed by the patient.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> runs a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tick-surveillance-scheme#tick-surveillance-scheme">tick surveillance scheme</a> and is happy to receive ticks for species identification and to monitor tick distribution.</p>

<h2>Investigation of suspected Lyme disease</h2>
<p>Erythema migrans is a clinical diagnosis and does not require confirmation by laboratory testing. Lyme disease is not a notifiable disease so there is no statutory requirement to notify clinically suspected cases to the local Health Protection Team.</p>

<p>See additional information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lyme-disease-differential-diagnosis">differential diagnoses for erythema migrans and other Lyme disease–like symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>The 2018 NICE Lyme disease guideline provides detailed advice about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng95/chapter/Recommendations#clinical-assessment" rel="external">when a diagnosis of Lyme disease should be suspected</a> and about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng95/chapter/Recommendations#laboratory-investigations-to-support-diagnosis" rel="external">which tests to use and when</a>.</p>

<p>The NICE Lyme disease guideline also contains a useful <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng95/resources/visual-summary-pdf-4792272301" rel="external">summary diagram</a> of the routine serological testing recommendations for Lyme disease.</p>

<h2>Investigation of suspected neurological Lyme disease</h2>

<p>The diagnosis of neurological Lyme disease can only be confirmed by examination of the <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> and a paired serum sample. A definite diagnosis is based on the presence of a pleocytosis (usually predominantly lymphocytes) in the <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>, demonstration of intrathecal synthesis of specific antibodies to Borrelia species in <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> by comparison to serum and the presence of neurological symptoms. It is not possible to confirm intrathecal synthesis and hence definite neurological Lyme disease without a paired serum (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-1331.2009.02862.x" rel="external">European Federation of Neurological Societies guidance</a>).</p>

<p>In 2018 <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> introduced a service for the detection of intrathecal synthesis of Borrelia-specific antibodies which is summarised in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://khub.net/documents/135939561/638134094/Neurological+Lyme+disease+laboratory+investigations+and+diagnosis.pdf/73c1c6c7-874a-30ff-8546-46f9b6bed970" rel="external">this flow diagram</a>. <a class="govuk-link" href="#flowcharttext">An accessible text version of this flowchart</a> is available below.</p>

<p>Clinicians may ask for guidance on laboratory testing of <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> from <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> if required.</p>

<h2>Sample types for Lyme disease testing</h2>
<p>For routine Lyme disease serological testing, you must send a serum sample (&gt;0.5 mL).</p>

<p>For testing for neurological Lyme disease, you must send paired <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> (&gt;0.5 mL) and serum (&gt;0.5 mL) samples taken on the same day. If possible, please provide <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> cell count and total albumin, <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> and <abbr title="immunoglobulin M">IgM</abbr> values. If albumin, <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> and <abbr title="immunoglobulin M">IgM</abbr> measurements are not available, <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> will make arrangements for these measurements at additional cost.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing is available. We recommend that specialists call <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> to discuss appropriate sample types for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>. These may include joint fluid, biopsy tissue, <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> and EDTA plasma. Please submit biopsies as fresh tissue in a sterile container, ideally with a drop of sterile saline to prevent the tissue drying out.</p>

<h2>Completion of Lyme disease test request form (P2)</h2>
<p>Diagnostic samples must be submitted with a completed <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lyme-disease-test-request-form">Lyme disease test request form (P2)</a>. Please use a single request form for each patient even when sending several samples.</p>

<p>Please provide details of the sample type(s), patient’s symptoms and onset date, tick bite or exposure history and, if relevant, travel and treatment history. Symptom onset date is particularly important for interpretation of laboratory results.</p>

<p>When sending <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>, please provide the cell count and total albumin, <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> and <abbr title="immunoglobulin M">IgM</abbr> levels for the <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> and serum pair, if available.</p>

<p>Ideally the clinician who sees the patient should print out and complete the appropriate request form (except for the sender’s information at the top). Send the request to the local laboratory with the clinical sample(s) along with a local laboratory request form, whether this is paper or electronic.</p>

<p>The local laboratory should complete the sender’s information on the request form and then forward the completed form and sample(s) to <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>. Before sending samples, clinicians are advised to liaise with their local laboratory because local arrangements may vary.</p>

<p>If only immunoblot confirmation is required because the local laboratory has already obtained a positive Lyme screening test result on the serum sample being submitted, tick the “Line blot confirmation only” box and write the positive screening test result below.</p>

<h2>Lyme disease laboratory tests available at <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The primary service provided by <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> is serological testing using well-characterised and validated screening and confirmatory tests in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng95" rel="external">NICE Lyme disease guideline</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> participates in regular external quality assurance exercises as an independent measure of its performance.</p>

<p>Details of prices and turnaround times for Lyme testing are provided in Appendix 1 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rare-and-imported-pathogens-laboratory-ripl-user-manual"><abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> user manual</a>.</p>

<h3>Serological testing of serum for the diagnosis of Lyme disease</h3>

<p>The most commonly used tests look for antibodies to the Borrelia species that cause Lyme disease in the UK and Europe, but they also detect infections from strains of Borrelia from the US.</p>

<p>The antibody response takes several weeks to reach a detectable level, so antibody tests in the first few weeks of infection may be negative. If the first sample was taken within 4 weeks from the onset of symptoms and is negative and there is a clinical suspicion of Lyme disease, then retesting in 4 to 6 weeks may be useful.</p>

<p>It is very rare for patients to have negative antibody tests in longstanding infections. Borrelia antibodies persist indefinitely in some patients and this does not indicate continuing disease or a need for re-treatment.</p>

<p>Serological testing for Lyme disease in the UK and much of the world follows a two-step approach:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first stage of testing uses a sensitive screening <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> test. Since 17 Dec 2020, <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> has used the Borrelia VlsE1/pepC10 <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr>/<abbr title="immunoglobulin M">IgM</abbr> <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> Test System (Zeus Scientific). This replaced the C6 Lyme <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> (Immunetics) which was withdrawn from the market for commercial reasons.</li>
  <li>Sensitive tests have the disadvantage of occasionally detecting other diseases and producing false positive results, so a second more specific confirmatory test is run on all samples giving a positive or indeterminate preliminary screening test result. <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> uses the Borrelia ViraChip®  <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr>, <abbr title="immunoglobulin M">IgM</abbr> test (Viramed Biotech AG) to confirm the presence of Borrelia-specific antibodies .</li>
</ol>

<h3>Serological testing of <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> for the diagnosis of neurological Lyme disease</h3>

<p>Serological testing for neurological Lyme disease is based on demonstrating intrathecal synthesis of Borrelia-specific antibodies in <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>. For laboratory testing for neurological Lyme disease, <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> ViraChip® serology assays are performed on <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> and paired serum and the results compared.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>CSF samples must be tested in parallel with a contemporaneous serum sample and albumin and total IgG levels compared between the 2 sample types to produce a meaningful result.</p>
</div>

<p>For necessary sample types and volumes see <a class="govuk-link" href="#samples">Sample types for Lyme disease testing</a>.</p>

<h3>Molecular testing for detection of Borrelia species bacterial <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is available for Borrelia species <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> detection but is of limited value in routine testing for Lyme disease because the organism is only present in blood during the early stages of the disease and is predominantly restricted to the affected tissues.</p>

<p>Diagnostic molecular testing for Borrelia species <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> is available on request for relevant specimen types. Please call <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> to discuss individual cases.</p>

<h2>Alternative diagnostic tests not available at <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>
</h2>
<p>Tests used by the NHS and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to identify Lyme disease are well characterised, standardised, and are highly reproducible between laboratories. They are the methods of choice recommended in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng95" rel="external">2018 NICE Lyme disease guidelines</a>, following an extensive review of the evidence and literature. International external quality assurance (EQA) schemes are in place to ensure consistency between different centres offering these tests.</p>

<p>Several private laboratories in Europe and the US offer an alternative type of test called an ELISpot to diagnose Lyme disease. This looks for different markers in blood samples compared to conventional validated Lyme disease serology tests. The laboratories using these tests in the diagnosis of Lyme disease do not publish their methods, and have not produced peer reviewed publications on their clinical value.</p>

<p>This makes it very difficult to verify their results, especially as there are no national or international EQA schemes for Lyme disease ELISpot tests and therefore no independent verification of performance between laboratories. Without independent evidence it is impossible to determine the validity of results produced using these alternative tests.</p>

<p>Other diagnostics tests such as CD57 test and direct microscopy are also advertised online. Like ELISpot tests, these assays are not recommended since robust clinical studies demonstrating their specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of Lyme disease do not exist. Similarly, independent external quality assurance schemes are not available for these tests.</p>

<p>RIPL cannot interpret the results of alternative diagnostic tests.</p>

<h2>Interpretation of Lyme disease results from <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Negative <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> on serum</h3>
<p>Early clinical Lyme disease in the form of erythema migrans with an associated history of a tick bite should be treated empirically. There is no need for testing unless there are further symptoms.</p>

<p>A negative <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> result in the early stages of Lyme disease (within 4 weeks of symptom onset) does not exclude infection. If acute Lyme disease is suspected but serology results are negative, we recommend that the test is repeated in 4 to 6 weeks with a fresh sample to look for seroconversion.</p>

<p>In patients with long term symptoms a negative <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> test usually excludes Lyme disease as a cause of these symptoms. Information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lyme-disease-differential-diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> for patients with persistent symptoms and negative Lyme disease serology results is available.</p>

<h3>Positive <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> on serum</h3>
<p><abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> will automatically proceed to do <abbr title="immunoglobulin M">IgM</abbr> and <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> immunoblot tests after a positive or indeterminate <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> test and will provide an overall interpretation of the <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> and immunoblot in the light of the clinical details provided on the request form.</p>

<p>Please provide clinical details to allow the interpretation of serological results. These are needed for interpretation because borrelia-specific antibodies may persist for several years in patients who have had Lyme disease in the past, long after the bacteria have been cleared from the body. Therefore, detection of borrelia specific antibodies in someone with no evidence of current clinical symptoms or recent tick exposure argues against active Lyme disease infection. After successful treatment of Lyme disease antibody concentrations may slowly fall over time.</p>

<p>Borrelia species are notifiable organisms. The numbers of positive results from laboratory confirmed cases in <abbr title="Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory">RIPL</abbr> are reported to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and analysed for inclusion in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/health-protection-report-latest-infection-reports#zoonoses"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Health Protection Reports</a> as part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lyme-borreliosis-epidemiology">Lyme disease epidemiology and surveillance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> serology results</h3>
<p>A positive <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> serology result to any Borrelia antigen that is not present in paired serum, or a higher blot intensity in <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> serology compared to paired normalised serum is evidence of intrathecal synthesis of Borrelia-specific antibodies and supports the diagnosis of neurological Lyme disease. The ViraChip analyser software automatically determines whether a particular serology result is positive or negative and no additional interpretation is permitted.</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a negative serum antibody result does not exclude a positive <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> result in early neurological Lyme disease, especially in children</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>neurological Lyme disease may not give rise to detectable antibodies in <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> so a negative <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> blot result does not exclude neurological Lyme disease as a cause of e.g. facial palsy in a child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reactivity to the borrelial OspC antigen in <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> has been associated with cross-reacting EBV antibodies in some individuals, especially in children - if this is the only evidence of neurological Lyme disease, the differential diagnosis should be considered</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As with serum serology, <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> test results are interpreted in the light of the clinical information provided.</p>

<p>If Borrelia-specific antibodies are not detected in paired serum and <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> samples collected 12 or more weeks after the onset of symptoms, then Lyme disease is highly unlikely.</p>

<h3>Borrelia species <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> results</h3>
<p>Borrelia species <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> may occasionally be detected in the blood by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, but a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is of no value in excluding localised Lyme disease.</p>

<p>The overall sensitivity of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> on a skin biopsy of an EM or ACA rash is around 50% and is limited by the chance of a single biopsy hitting a site with a significant number of organisms.</p>

<p>In neurological Lyme disease involving the CNS, up to 10% of cases may be <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positive on a <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> sample; a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result does not exclude the diagnosis.</p>

<p>Synovial fluid may be positive by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> in up to 50% of cases. A negative result does not exclude the diagnosis.</p>

<h2>Neurological Lyme disease: laboratory investigations and diagnosis</h2>

<h3>Accessible text version of the flowchart</h3>

<p>If neurological Lyme disease is suspected by a specialist doctor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>offer a test for intrathecal antibody production</li>
  <li>take a paired serum and <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> sample (each greater than or equal to 500 µL)</li>
</ul>

<p>Send the paired serum and <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> sample to the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Lyme disease service along with (if known):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> cell count</li>
  <li>the serum total albumin and <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> total albumin and <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If not known, the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Lyme disease service will measure these last 2 parameters.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Lyme service will carry out an <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> immunoblot test on the <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> and appropriately diluted paired serum.</p>

<p>If there is a positive <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> immunoblot result, this is indicative of intrathecal production of antibodies to Borrelia spp. If the symptoms are compatible with neurological Lyme disease and/or there is evidence of pleocytosis in the <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>, treat.</p>

<p>If there is no positive <abbr title="immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> immunoblot result, offer a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test on the <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr> if symptoms 
are less than or equal to 6 weeks in duration and there is enough <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result is positive it means Borrelia spp <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> has been detected in the <abbr title="cerebrospinal fluid">CSF</abbr>, which is diagnostic of neurological Lyme disease, and the patient must be treated.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result is negative, consider an alternative diagnosis. If Lyme remains a possibility, offer a screening <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> test on serum in 6 weeks.</p>
