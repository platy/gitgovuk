<h2>COVID-19 testing for hauliers after entering England</h2>

<p>From April 6, hauliers arriving in England from abroad will need to take a COVID-19 test if they are staying for more than 2 days. They need to take the first test within the first 2 days, then further tests every 3 days.</p>

<p>This will apply to drivers and crews of HGVs and drivers of vans and other light goods vehicles. It applies to both <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-based and non-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> hauliers.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" role="note" aria-label="Warning">
<p>If you do not have proof of a negative COVID-19 test, you could be fined £2,000.</p>
</div>

<h3>Who does not need to take a test.</h3>

<p>You do not need to take a test if you will be in England for 2 days or less.</p>

<p>You do not need to take a test if you arrive in England from Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man - known as the Common Travel Area (CTA). You must have only been in the CTA or the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> in the 10 days before arrival. If you have been outside the CTA in the 10 days before you arrive in England, you must take the tests.</p>

<h2>When to get tested</h2>

<p>You will need to take at least 3 tests, if you will be staying in England for 10 days or longer.</p>

<p>You must take the first test within 2 days of your arrival. The day of your arrival is counted as day 0.</p>

<p>You must take the second test 3 days after your first test and the third test 3 days after your second test.</p>

<p>So if your first test is on day one, your second test will be on day 4 and your third test on day 7.</p>

<p>If your first test is on day 2, your second test will be day 5 and your third test on day 8.</p>

<p>The date and time of your arrival will be collected and recorded in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">passenger locator form</a>, which you are required to complete.</p>

<h3>If you cannot get a test</h3>

<p>If you cannot get a test at a time when one is due, for example because of temporary closure of testing facilities or lack of provision in the area, you should take a test as soon as possible once you can access a testing site.</p>

<h2>Where to get a test</h2>

<p>Free testing for hauliers is available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/haulier-advice-site-locations" class="govuk-link">haulier advice sites</a> around the country.</p>

<p>You do not need to book a test in advance but you should check the list of sites to make sure they open and if they are likely to be busy.</p>

<p>If you take a test at a haulier advice site, you will be provided with a letter which states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the time and date of the test</li>
  <li>the day of testing - for example, day 2, day 5 or day 8</li>
  <li>some personal details, which can be used as evidence of undertaking the test</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>workplace testing, if your company has bought the tests from an authorised test provider</li>
  <li>community testing - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-covid-19-lateral-flow-test-site">check for community testing sites in your area</a>
</li>
  <li>home-based testing</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing" class="govuk-link">private testing</a> - you will need to pay for this</li>
</ul>

<p>Where <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>-based international hauliers use workplace or home testing, they will be expected to register the fact of the test on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.covid19.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">NHS app</a>. The fact of this registration can then be used as evidence.</p>

<h2>When you get to the test site</h2>

<p>Protect yourself and others by keeping a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#social-distancing" class="govuk-link">safe distance</a> and wearing a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">face covering</a>.</p>

<p>Do not leave your vehicle except to use the rest facilities or when asked to by a member of staff.</p>

<p>A member of staff will give you a test kit.</p>

<h2>Taking the test</h2>

<p>The test involves taking a swab at the back of your throat and the inside of your nose using a long cotton bud.</p>

<p>You do the test yourself. Staff will watch you, and the test kit has instructions for you to follow.</p>

<h2>After you’ve taken the test</h2>

<p>Return to your vehicle and wait for 30 minutes for the results when you’ve taken the test.</p>

<h3>If your test result is negative </h3>

<p>You will receive proof of your negative result if you test negative.</p>

<p>Staff will then direct you to your departure point and you’ll be able to continue your journey.</p>

<p>You’ll need to show your test result to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enforcement officers in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>border officials in the countries that require them</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep the result safe. If you lose it, you’ll need to take another test.</p>

<h3>If your test result is positive </h3>

<p>You cannot continue your journey if the test result is positive.</p>

<p>What you do next depends on where you can safely self-isolate.</p>

<p>A small number of test sites will immediately carry out a second test to confirm the result if you’ve tested positive for coronavirus.</p>

<h3>If you can safely self-isolate in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You can self-isolate in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> if you have a home in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, or if you can stay with family or friends in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Return your vehicle to your depot or place of work. Do not share the vehicle with anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">home and self-isolate</a>. Your household needs to self-isolate too.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">Book a free NHS coronavirus test</a> within 48 hours to confirm the test result. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the NHS test result is positive, you and your household will need to complete the full self-isolation period.   </p>

<p>If your NHS test result is negative, you and your household can end your self-isolation period.  </p>

<h3>If you cannot safely self-isolate in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you do not have anywhere to stay in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, it means you cannot safely self-isolate.</p>

<p>You’ll be given hotel accommodation so you can safely self-isolate and support staff will arrange a second coronavirus test for you to confirm the result.</p>

<p>You’ll be directed to a hotel to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#if-you-have-covid-19-symptoms-or-have-received-a-positive-covid-19-test-result">self-isolate</a>.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Park your vehicle in the hotel car park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrange with your company for any perishable or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-a-coronavirus-covid-19-test-if-youre-an-hgv-or-van-driver#dangerous" class="govuk-link">dangerous goods</a> to be picked up by another driver. Staff at the hotel will tell you how to do this safely.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Support staff will arrange for you to have a second coronavirus test to confirm your result. Most people get their result within a few days.</p>

<p>If your second test result is negative, staff will direct you to a test site for another coronavirus test. Once your negative test has been confirmed, you’ll receive proof and will be free to continue your journey.</p>

<p>If your second test result is positive, you’ll have to self-isolate at the hotel for 10 days. After 10 days, you’ll receive proof to show you have completed your isolation period and will be free to continue your journey.</p>

<p>You will not have to pay for the hotel accommodation and food.</p>

<p>You should not leave the hotel without permission while you’re self-isolating.</p>

<p>You do not need to take a test if you are returning to the Netherlands after spending less than 48 hours in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>You will need a time-stamped document or ticket to prove that you have been in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for less than 48 hours. Read more about <a href="#times" class="govuk-link">round trips of under 48 hours from the Netherlands</a>.</p>

<h2>Where to get a test</h2>

<p>You can either get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a private test from your company (if it has bought them from an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing">authorised test provider</a>)</li>
  <li>a free coronavirus test at most haulier advice sites</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" role="note" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You cannot use an NHS test result to leave the UK because it does not give you the proof you need to travel.</p>
</div>

<p>Most haulier advice sites are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>located at motorway services and truck stops</li>
  <li>open between 6am and 9:30pm, 7 days a week</li>
</ul>

<p>Visit a site as early as possible in your journey. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://highwaysengland.co.uk/travel-updates/">Check the latest traffic updates from Highways England</a> to help you plan.</p>

<p>If you’re leaving the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> via Kent, you should take a test before you reach Kent. This applies if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re travelling via the Channel ports or Eurotunnel</li>
  <li>you’re <a class="govuk-link" href="#dangerous">carrying dangerous goods</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the opening times for the site you want to use before you travel.</p>

<p>You do not need to book in advance. </p>

<p><a class="gem-c-button govuk-button govuk-button--start" role="button" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/haulier-advice-site-locations#find-your-nearest-haulier-advice-site"> Find a site <svg class="govuk-button__start-icon" height="19" focusable="false" width="17.5" viewBox="0 0 33 40" role="presentation" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill="currentColor" d="M0 0h13l20 20-20 20H0l20-20z"></path></svg></a></p>

<h3>If you’re using the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel</h3>

<p>A negative test result remains valid for entry to the Netherlands via France for 72 hours. This gives you enough time to get tested before you set off, or at the start of your journey.</p>

<p>Get a test before you enter Kent. You’ll then be fast-tracked past any queues.</p>

<p>You’ll also need a valid <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-hgv-border">Kent Access Permit</a>.</p>

<p>You do not need to take a test if you are returning to the Netherlands after spending less than 48 hours in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<h3>If you’re carrying dangerous goods</h3>

<p>You must take a coronavirus test before you enter Kent if you’re carrying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explosives</li>
  <li>polymerising substances</li>
  <li>infectious substances</li>
  <li>radioactive substances</li>
  <li>goods that are of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-requirements-for-moving-dangerous-goods-by-road-and-rail">high consequence for terrorism</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because these types of loads are not allowed at the sites in Kent. You’ll be refused access if you’re carrying them.</p>

<p>Check with your transport manager or consignor if you’re not sure if your goods fall into any of these categories.</p>

<h2>When you get to the test site</h2>

<p>Protect yourself and others by keeping a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19#keep-a-safe-distance-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">safe distance</a> and wearing a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19#wear-a-face-covering">face covering</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid leaving your vehicle except to use the rest facilities or when asked to by a member of staff.</p>

<p>If you already have a valid negative test, let a member of staff know. If you do not need to take a test, you’ll be directed to your departure point and will be able to continue your journey.</p>

<p>If you do need to take a test, a member of staff will give you a test kit.</p>

<h2>Take the test</h2>

<p>The test involves taking a swab at the back of your throat and the inside of your nose using a long cotton bud.</p>

<p>You do the test yourself. Staff will watch you, and the test kit has instructions for you to follow.</p>

<h2>After you’ve taken the test</h2>

<p>Return to your vehicle and wait for 30 minutes for the results when you’ve taken the test.</p>

<h3>If your test result is negative </h3>

<p>You will receive proof of your negative result if you test negative.</p>

<p>Staff will then direct you to your departure point and you’ll be able to continue your journey.</p>

<p>You’ll need to show your test result to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enforcement officers in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>border officials in the countries that require them</li>
</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Keep the result safe. If you lose it, you’ll need to take another test.</p>
</div>

<h3>If your test result is positive </h3>

<p>You cannot continue your journey if the test result is positive.</p>

<p>What you do next depends on where you can safely self-isolate.</p>

<p>A small number of test sites will immediately carry out a second test to confirm the result if you’ve tested positive for coronavirus.</p>

<h4>If you can safely self-isolate in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h4>

<p>You can safely self-isolate in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> if you have a home in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, or if you can stay with family or friends in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Return your vehicle to your depot or place of work. Do not share the vehicle with anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go home and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">self-isolate</a>. Your household needs to self-isolate too.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">Book a free NHS coronavirus test</a> within 48 hours to confirm the test result. </p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the NHS test result is positive, you and your household will need to complete the full self-isolation period.   </p>

<p>If your NHS test result is negative, you and your household can end your self-isolation period.  </p>

<h4>If you cannot safely self-isolate in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h4>

<p>If you do not have anywhere to stay in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, it means you cannot safely self-isolate.</p>

<p>You’ll be given hotel accommodation so you can safely self-isolate and support staff will arrange a second coronavirus test for you to confirm the result.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You’ll be directed to a hotel to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#if-you-have-covid-19-symptoms-or-have-received-a-positive-covid-19-test-result" class="govuk-link">self-isolate</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Park your vehicle in the hotel car park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrange with your company for any perishable or <a href="#dangerous" class="govuk-link">dangerous goods</a> to be picked up by another driver. Staff at the hotel will tell you how to do this safely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support staff will arrange for you to have a second coronavirus test to confirm your result. Most people get their result within a few days.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If your second test result is negative, staff will direct you to a test site for another coronavirus test. Once your negative test has been confirmed, you’ll receive proof and will be free to continue your journey.</p>

<p>If your second test result is positive, you’ll have to self-isolate at the hotel for 10 days. After 10 days, you’ll receive proof to show you have completed your isolation period and will be free to continue your journey.</p>

<p>You will not have to pay for the hotel accommodation and food.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>You should not leave the hotel without permission while you’re self-isolating.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other documents you need for international road haulage</h2>

<p>You need to have the right:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driver-documents-required-for-international-road-haulage">driver documents</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vehicle-documents-required-for-international-road-haulage" class="govuk-link">vehicle documents</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You must have a valid Kent Access Permit if your <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> is both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leaving Great Britain from the Port of Dover or the Eurotunnel</li>
  <li>over 7.5 tonnes</li>
</ul>

<p>The permit also makes sure you have the right documents for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> import controls.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-hgv-border" class="govuk-link">Apply for a Kent Access Permit</a>.</p>

<p>If you are going via France you must have a <a href="https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/fr/Actualites/L-actu-du-Ministere/Deplacement-des-transporteurs-routiers-internationaux" rel="external" class="govuk-link">completed self-declaration certificate</a> confirming you have no COVID-19 symptoms and have not had contact with a positive case in the 14 days before your journey.</p>

<h2>Expected journey times from the Netherlands to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You do not need to take a test if you are returning to the Netherlands after spending less than 48 hours in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The 48-hour window for round-trips will start from when you arrive in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from the Netherlands. However, you will not receive a time stamp when you arrive in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Cross-Channel and North Sea operators will give you evidence of the time you depart the Netherlands for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>You are not required to arrive and depart using the same route. For example, you can arrive in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> via Eurotunnel and depart from Dover to Calais, or Harwick to Hoek van Holland.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>If you’re unlikely to arrive at the UK departure port within the required timeframe, you should go directly to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/haulier-advice-site-locations" class="govuk-link">haulier advice location site</a> to take a COVID-19 test.</p>
</div>

<p>It is your responsibility to complete your return journey in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> within 48 hours. If your scheduled departure from the Netherlands is delayed, this will have an impact on the 48-hour window.</p>

<p>This window is based on time of departure from the Netherlands and upon arriving at the port for your return journey to the Netherlands. The information in the following table will help you to calculate how much time you can spend in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> if, for example, your ferry departure is delayed.</p>
