<p>You can apply for 3 grants to help your business complete customs declarations, in preparation for the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<ul>
  <li>be established in, or have a branch in the UK when the grant is paid to you</li>
  <li>not have previously failed to meet its tax obligations – we’ll check our records to decide if we can offer your business a grant</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for just one of the grants, or all of them.</p>

<h3 id="recruitment-grant">Recruitment grant</h3>

<p>To apply for the grant, your business must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>currently complete customs declarations on behalf of importers and exporters</li>
  <li>have been established in the UK for at least 12 months</li>

<h3 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h3>

<p>You must use the funding to cover the recruitment and salary costs of new employees from 1 October 2019, who will help your business complete customs declarations.</p>

<h3 id="training">Training</h3>

<p>You cannot use the funding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>towards the existing costs of current training</li>
  <li>for other unrelated training</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use the grant to reimburse what your business has spent on relevant training since 31 July 2019.</p>

<h3 id="it-improvements">IT improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>buy hardware that’s needed for the software to run</li>
  <li>install and configure the software and hardware</li>

<h2 id="amounts-of-funding-available">Amounts of funding available</h2>

<h3 id="recruitment-grant-1">Recruitment grant</h3>

<p>The grant will give you £3,000 for each employee.</p>

<p>You could also get up to £10,000 for any employee you recruit before before 31 January 2020, to cover up to 3 months’ salary.</p>

<p>You will receive the funding for recruitment costs and 50% of the eligible salary costs upfront.  The remaining 50% of salary costs will be paid when the employee has been in post for one month.</p>

<h3 id="training-grant-1">Training grant</h3>

<p>The grant will give you up to 100% of the cost of training for your employees, up to a limit of £2,250 for each course.</p>

<p>It will also cover the cost of training you run internally, up to a limit of £250 for each employee on the course.</p>

<h3 id="it-improvements-1">IT improvements</h3>

<p>The grant will give you up to 200,000 euros (the maximum amount of state aid available).</p>

<h2 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll need</h2>

<p>When you apply, you’ll be asked for your business’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered name and number</li>
  <li>contact details</li>
  <li>VAT number (if this applies)</li>
  <li>Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)</li>
  <li>most recent utility bill</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on which grant you’re applying for, you’ll also need to provide some information about what you’ll use the funding for.</p>

<h3 id="recruitment-1">Recruitment</h3>

<p>You’ll be asked to complete a short application setting out how the money will be used. You’ll need to give information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>why you expect your business to need more staff</li>
  <li>the stage your recruitment process is at</li>
  <li>your reasons for expecting to have any new staff employed before 31 January 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>To get the second 50% of eligible salary costs, you’ll need to provide for each new employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their contract of employment</li>
  <li>first month payslip</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="training-grant-2">Training grant</h3>

<p>You’ll be asked for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a quote for the cost of the training</li>
  <li>the CV of the trainer if the training will be delivered internally</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="it-improvements-grant-1">IT improvements grant</h3>

<p>You’ll be asked for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the software you intend to buy</li>
  <li>quotes for the cost of:
    <ul>
      <li>buying and installing the software</li>
      <li>buying and installing related hardware</li>
      <li>training employees to use the software</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h2>

<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers (<abbr title="PricewaterhouseCoopers">PwC</abbr>) is administering the grants for HMRC.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.customsintermediarygrant.co.uk/">Apply online through <abbr title="PricewaterhouseCoopers">PwC</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2 id="after-youve-applied">After you’ve applied</h2>

<p>If your application is successful you’ll get a grant offer letter.</p>

<p>You’ll need to submit proof of how much you’ve spent on IT improvements or training within 2 months of getting the grant offer letter.</p>

<p>You’ll then get the grant within 30 days. It’ll be paid by <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing System">Bacs</abbr> to a UK bank account in the name of the person who applied.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-treat-the-grants-for-tax">How to treat the grants for tax</h2>

<p>When calculating your business’s taxable profits, you need to match the treatment of the grant to the expense covered by the grant. For example, if the training expense is deductible, then you should include the amount of grant in your calculation of taxable profits so that the expense is offset.</p>

<p>If your business has spent more on capital expenditure (like IT equipment) than is covered by the grant, you can get capital allowance on the amount not covered by the grant.</p>

<p>Your business cannot get capital allowance on the amount of grant covering the cost of your business’s capital expenditure.</p>
