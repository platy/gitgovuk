<h2>Level 3 BTEC and Cambridge Technicals results</h2>

<p>Our immediate priority has been to make sure that Pearson and OCR got results to students promptly, so they can progress. We have been monitoring the situation closely and have asked Pearson and OCR to give us regular updates so that we can be confident that they are swiftly issuing results.</p>

<p>Pearson and OCR have confirmed that they have identified all students who are dependent on their result for a higher education place. The awarding organisations have told us that results have been issued to these students, where they have been able to, or that they have informed schools and colleges why these students are not eligible to receive a result where that is the case. In a small number of cases, schools and colleges are working with awarding organisations to confirm the eligibility of some students to receive a result.</p>

<p>It is important that, as regulator, we review what has happened to make sure that students in future years receive results when they expect them, so they can progress in their education, apprenticeship or employment. We will continue to work across the sector, in addition to using our regulatory relationship with awarding organisations, to this end.</p>

<p>Colleges and schools should contact awarding organisations, and students should contact their college or school.</p>

<p>For updates and help with BTEC qualification results, contact Pearson on 0345 618 0440 or via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/PearsonBTEC" rel="external">@PearsonBTEC</a> on social media, or visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pearson.com/uk/learners/fe-and-college-students/your-questions-answered.html" rel="external">Results Day 2022 FAQs</a>.</p>

<p>For updates and help with Cambridge Technicals qualification results, visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://teach.ocr.org.uk/cambridge-technicals-update" rel="external">the Cambridge Technicals update website</a> or contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:support@ocr.org.uk">support@ocr.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Vocational and technical qualifications (VTQs) come in different shapes and sizes. They are flexible by design, so students can sit individual modules when they are ready, and they can get their results at different times of the year when they have completed the required number of units. These flexibilities are valued by students, employers and schools and colleges. This does mean awards are more complex, and particularly so this year, due to the arrangements put in place to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This does not, of course, excuse delays where students were expecting to receive results.</p>

<h2>Level 1/2 and Level 2 vocational and technical qualification results</h2>

<p>Results for BTEC First, Technicals and Tech Award Qualifications, and Cambridge Nationals are issued throughout the year. More than 350,000 results have been awarded for Level 1/2 and Level 2 vocational qualifications since March 2022.</p>

<p>Many students have received results for Level 1/2 and Level 2 qualifications this week, to enable them to progress to further study, apprenticeships and work. These results are normally issued on, or before, 25 August.</p>

<p>Students should talk to their college or school if they have any queries about their results.</p>

<p>For updates on BTEC Firsts, Technical and Tech awards, visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pearson.com/uk/learners/fe-and-college-students/level-2-results-2022.html" rel="external">Pearsonâ€™s FAQs</a>. For updates on Cambridge Nationals, visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://teach.ocr.org.uk/gcse-cambridge-nationals-update" rel="external">OCRâ€™s website</a>.</p>

<h2>Unhappy with your exam results</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re not happy with your exam results in some subjects, you have the options to appeal your results or retake your exams in those subjects. Your school or college will be able to tell you about the process for both of these.</p>

</div>

<h2>Anxiety and mental health support</h2>

<p>We understand that this has been a difficult time for students and you have shown great resilience in the face of the challenges presented by the pandemic. Always make sure you speak to somebody if you are feeling anxious or struggling with your mental health. This might be a parent, carer or someone else you trust.</p>

<h2>Subject content and assessment arrangements: 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>Ofqual and the Department for Education have confirmed the arrangements for subject content in GCSEs, AS and A levels and non-exam assessment in qualifications taking place in the academic year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/subject-content-and-assessment-arrangements-2022-to-2023">statement from Ofqual and the Department for Education on content and assessment for qualifications next academic year</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>This means that the assessment arrangements for GCSE, AS and A level qualifications being awarded in 2023 will be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for GCSEs in English literature, history, ancient history and geography, students will study and be assessed on all the usual topics and content</li>
  <li>for dance, design and technology, drama (and theatre), food preparation and nutrition, film studies, media studies, music, music technology, physical education (PE), students will carry out the usual non-exam assessment activities</li>
  <li>for art and design, students will be assessed by an exam board set task and a portfolio as usual</li>
  <li>for geography, geology, and science subjects, students will carry out the usual fieldwork and practical science activities</li>
  <li>for GCSEs in English language, students will carry out spoken language assessments as usual and some of these will be recorded by their teachers</li>
  <li>for GCSEs in modern foreign languages, students will take formal speaking tests as usual</li>
</ul>

<h2>New guidance for exam boards on producing accessible assessments</h2>

<p>Ofqual has published new guidance for exam boards and awarding organisations on making assessments accessible for students.</p>

<p>The guidance supports awarding organisations to design and develop assessments to meet rules on accessibility.â€¯It explains that, in their exams and assessments, awarding organisations should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use accessible and appropriate languageâ€¯â€¯</li>
  <li>use clear and consistent layoutâ€¯</li>
  <li>use source material, context, images and colour in ways that do not disadvantage studentsâ€¯</li>
  <li>consider how Reasonable Adjustments could be made to the exam or assessment to make sure disabled students are not disadvantaged</li>
</ul>

<h2>Replacement certificates</h2>

<p><strong>Ofqual does not hold copies of your certificates</strong>&nbsp;â€“ we canâ€™t tell you your grade or provide replacements. Certificates are held by the exam board you sat your qualification with. If you donâ€™t know which exam board you took your qualification with, ask your school. If your school donâ€™t know you will need to ask each exam board to do a search for you â€“ they will charge you for this.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/replacement-exam-certificate/who-to-contact">Contact your exam board to get a replacement certificate</a>. If your exam board no longer exists, your certificates will have moved to an existing board.&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/replacement-exam-certificate/if-your-old-exam-board-no-longer-exists">Find out who now holds your certificates</a>.</p>
