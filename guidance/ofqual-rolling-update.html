<h2>Extra support for summer 2022 GCSEs, AS and A levels</h2>

<p>The government intends that exams will go ahead in summer 2022, with some changes to exams and&nbsp;non-exam assessments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exams will be graded more generously this year – providing a safety net for students</li>
  <li>advance information will help students to focus their revision</li>
  <li>exam boards have provided advance information for exams in most subjects</li>
  <li>students will have a choice of topics or content in some other GCSE subjects</li>
  <li>exam boards will provide a formulae sheet and an updated equation sheet that students will have in their GCSE maths, physics and combined science exams</li>
</ul>

<h2>Vocational and technical qualifications 2022</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/arrangements-for-the-assessment-and-awarding-of-vocational-technical-and-other-general-qualifications-2021-to-2022">Results for vocational and technical qualifications in 2022 will be based on the outcome of exams and assessments</a>. Awarding organisations will be allowed to make adaptations to assessments and qualifications, where they need to, due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>In early December we updated our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-centres-awarding-vtqs-in-2021-and-2022">guidance on the awarding of vocational and technical qualifications in the academic year 2021 to 2022</a>. The guidance is for schools, colleges and training providers, and includes information on T Levels, Functional Skills Qualifications and Apprenticeship end-point assessments.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For more information see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-guide-to-exams-and-formal-assessments-in-2021-to-2022">student guide to exams and assessments in 2022</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Contingency plans in case exams cannot go ahead as planned</h2>

<p>The government intends that exams will go ahead in 2022. If exams cannot go ahead as planned, students will receive grades determined by their teachers, using teacher-assessed grades (TAGs) similar to those used in summer 2021. TAGs are based on teachers’ assessment of their students’ work.</p>

<p>For GCSEs, AS and A levels, we have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-contingency-arrangements-for-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-summer-2022">guidance for schools and colleges on how to collect evidence from their students</a> in the remainder of the academic year, so that this evidence is available in case TAGs are needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our guidance encourages schools to use their existing assessment plans and not to over-assess students. In many cases, the necessary assessments will already be planned to support students’ learning and help them prepare for summer exams.</p>

<h3>Private candidates</h3>

<p>As we expect exams to take place in 2022, we are encouraging schools, colleges and other exam centres to allow private candidates to register with them in the usual way.</p>

<p>If exams cannot go ahead as planned, private candidates will need to work with a school, college or other exam centre to generate evidence for a teacher-assessed grade. A private candidate could take assessments through the year to produce this evidence. Alternatively, a private candidate could choose to be assessed only if it is decided that exams cannot take place. They would then need to find a school, college or other exam centre to work with, and would be assessed in a more compressed period of time.</p>

<p>The Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) has published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/private-candidates/" rel="external">list of schools, colleges and other exam centres</a> that make exam entries for private candidate for GCSEs, AS and A levels in summer 2022. Schools, colleges and other exam centres that are not in the JCQ list might still make entries for private candidates – they do not need to be included in the list in order to do so.</p>

<p>For vocational and technical qualifications, the Department for Education has published&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/awarding-qualifications-in-summer-2022">guidance on contingency measures</a>. The contingency arrangements would include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using TAGs for those qualifications most similar to GCSEs and A levels</li>
  <li>delaying the awarding of qualifications that require students to demonstrate occupational or professional competence</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special consideration for Applied Generals, Tech Awards, Tech Certs and Tech Levels taken in January</h3>

<p>We’ve compiled <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/special-consideration-policies-for-technical-qualifications">information on policies for special consideration</a> for awarding organisations that delivered January assessments for Applied Generals, Tech Awards, Tech Certs and Tech Levels. Special consideration is used where a student has temporarily experienced an illness or injury, or other event outside their control, which is likely to have adversely affected their ability to demonstrate their knowledge and skills during assessment.</p>

<h2>Replacement certificates</h2>

<p><strong>Ofqual does not hold copies of your certificates</strong>&nbsp;– we can’t tell you your grade or provide replacements. Certificates are held by the exam board you sat your qualification with. If you don’t know which exam board you took your qualification with, ask your school. If your school don’t know you will need to ask each exam board to do a search for you – they will charge you for this.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/replacement-exam-certificate/who-to-contact">Contact your exam board to get a replacement certificate</a>. If your exam board no longer exists, your certificates will have moved to an existing board.&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/replacement-exam-certificate/if-your-old-exam-board-no-longer-exists">Find out who now holds your certificates</a>.</p>

<h2>Anxiety and mental health support</h2>

<p>We understand that this has been a difficult time for students and you have shown great resilience in the face of the challenges presented by the pandemic. Always make sure you speak to somebody if you are feeling anxious or struggling with your mental health. This might be a parent, carer or someone else you trust.</p>
