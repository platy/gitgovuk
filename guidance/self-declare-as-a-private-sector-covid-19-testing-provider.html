<p>The government has published this guidance on the minimum standards that private providers of COVID-19 testing services are expected to meet when offering services to organisations or members of the public.</p>

<p>A list of self-declared private providers of COVID-19 testing will be published on GOV.UK. This is also the first stage of <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation (<abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> Applicant stage). To complete this stage and to be published on the GOV.UK list of private providers, you must declare that your service meets these minimum standards by <a href="#form" class="govuk-link">completing the form</a>.</p>

<p>To be published on the list you will also need to provide some additional information to support our due diligence checks and this will be reviewed by <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>To become an accredited test provider, please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/resources/latest-news/government-announces-minimum-standards-for-covid-19-testing/" rel="external">visit the UKAS website</a> and complete an application form before making a self-declaration.</p>
</div>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The current minimum standards are summarised as follows (more detail is provided in the form):</p>

<h3>1. Requirement of a clinical or medical director or equivalent and healthcare scientist</h3>
<p>The provider must have a designated resourced role that has oversight and approval of medical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting medical issues. The individual must be a registered medical practitioner.</p>

<p>The provider must also have a designated resourced role that has oversight of clinical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting clinical issues. This individual must be a registered medical practitioner or a healthcare scientist, registered with the Health and Care Professions Council.</p>

<p>The same individual can fulfil both roles (medical and clinical) providing they are duly registered.</p>

<h3>2. The test product must be permitted to be put into service in accordance with part 4 of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, other than solely by virtue of an authorisation made under regulation 39(2) of those regulations.</h3>

<p>This requirement is to ensure that the test product has a CE marking (or, once the UK leaves the European Union on December 31st, a UKCA marking).</p>

<p>A CE mark is a logo that is placed on an in vitro diagnostic (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic">IVD</abbr>) medical device to show that it conforms to the requirements of the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC, as implemented by the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (note: it’s currently an offence under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to place a device on the market or supply without a CE mark, unless a derogation has been obtained from <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> under the Medical Devices Regulations 2002).</p>

<p>A CE mark shows that the device is fit for its intended purpose stated and meets legislative requirements relating to safety.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, tests with a UKCA mark can be used. Tests with a CE mark can be used until July 2023.</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance on medical devices regulation from 1 January 2021</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking" class="govuk-link">guidance on CE marking</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.GOV.UK/government/publications/in-vitro-diagnostic-medical-devices-guidance-on-legislation">In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Alignment to DHSC <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> target product profile scope</h3>
<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) has published target product profiles (<abbr title="target product profiles:">TPPs</abbr>) for different types of test, setting out the ‘scope’ of what that test should be used for, including target use, target user and target use settings.</p>

<p>The provider must declare that they’re using the test in line with its published scope. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has set out guidance explaining how both virus and antibody tests work.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency" class="govuk-link">about <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a></li>

</ul>

<p>Note: this standard only applies to providers solely providing COVID-19 testing services for domestic purposes. Providers of ‘Testing to Release for International Travel’ (or their sub-contractors, if relevant) must adhere to the more stringent minimum standard ‘Use of tests which meet minimum performance characteristics’. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/testing-to-release-for-international-travel-minimum-standards-for-testing" class="govuk-link">minimum standards for these services</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Reporting of coronavirus test results</h3>
<p>The test provider must have a system in place for reporting positive, negative, inconclusive (indeterminate) and void test results to UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) in accordance with public health legislation.</p>

<p>Providers who use a laboratory to process test results are not under a legal requirement to report but should ensure they pass all relevant information to their laboratory to meet statutory requirements for reporting COVID-19 test results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. Every effort should be made to provide the testing laboratory with the required case information. If the laboratory does not receive sufficient case information to report to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> directly, the laboratory will need to agree a process with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to ensure that the provider of the test, or a third-party client, provides the required test and case information to meet the laboratory’s legal reporting obligations.</p>

<h4>Point-of-care testing (<abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr>)</h4>

<p><abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> providers using NHS Test and Trace or government-provided kits should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">report results online</a>.</p>

<p>For those using privately acquired <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> kits, please contact the <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> support team on <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:poct.contact@phe.gov.uk">poct.contact@phe.gov.uk</a>. This data must follow a specific format, and the template is available from the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> support team. Read the full guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-and-influenza-point-of-care-testing-results-how-to-report" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 and influenza point-of-care testing results: how to report</a>.</p>

<p>It is a requirement that <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> providers transfer the following information to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, insofar as it is known to the test provider.</p>

<p>In relation to the person being tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name</li>
  <li>surname</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>NHS number (if known)</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>current address (including postcode)</li>
  <li>telephone number (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 positive or indeterminate results)</li>
  <li>email address (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 positive or indeterminate results)</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to the test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of the test provider</li>
  <li>the type of establishment of the test provider (for example school)</li>
  <li>test result code (such as COVID-19 +ve/-ve or influenza A +ve/-ve)</li>
  <li>specimen identification number (if applicable)</li>
  <li>specimen type</li>
  <li>specimen date</li>
  <li>date the test was performed</li>
  <li>test method (for example <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>name of the testing equipment manufacturer</li>
</ul>

<p>Positive and indeterminate COVID-19 test results should be reported to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> as soon as they are available from the test device and, at the latest, within 24 hours, which is the statutory requirement.</p>

<p>Negative and void COVID-19 test results, and positive, indeterminate, negative and void influenza test results, can be sent to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> within 7 days of testing.</p>

<h4>Laboratories</h4>

<p>There is a legal requirement for laboratories to report positive, negative, inconclusive (indeterminate) and void test results cases to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> in accordance with public health legislation.</p>

<p>To support the reporting of the required infectious diseases, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has developed the Second Generation Surveillance System (<abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr>). This is the national surveillance system that holds all test results.</p>

<p>It is understood that laboratories may not have established systems to report results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. However, there is a legal requirement to report. It is recommended that laboratories in this situation contact the <abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr> helpdesk on <a href="mailto:sgss.helpdesk@phe.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">sgss.helpdesk@phe.gov.uk</a> or the <abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr> COVID Incident Team on <a href="mailto:sgss.covidincident@phe.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">sgss.covidincident@phe.gov.uk</a> and they will put the laboratory in touch with the local <abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr> support team. Read the full guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notifiable-diseases-and-causative-organisms-how-to-report#reporting-of-sars-cov-2-test-results-to-public-health-england">Notifiable diseases and causative organisms: how to report</a>.</p>

<p>Laboratories are legally required to report the following information to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, insofar as the laboratory has this information.</p>

<p>In relation to the person being tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name</li>
  <li>surname</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>home address (including postcode)</li>
  <li>contact telephone number (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 for positive or indeterminate  results)</li>
  <li>contact email address (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 for positive or indeterminate  results)</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>NHS number</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to the test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sample taken date</li>
  <li>sample type</li>
  <li>test method (for example <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>result (such as COVID-19 +ve/-ve)</li>
  <li>name of laboratory</li>
  <li>address of laboratory</li>
  <li>name, address and organisation of the person who solicited the test</li>
</ul>

<p>Laboratories should ensure they receive all relevant information from the provider to ensure accurate reporting.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If laboratories do not have this data, they should request the missing data from the provider who solicited the test, as it assists with daily contact tracing and helps to break down the transmission of COVID-19.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the legally required information outlined above, laboratories should also provide the following fields, insofar as the laboratory has this information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sample number/specimen ID – the format of the specimen must be as follows: ‘Reporting Laboratory Shortcode’ (the laboratory shortcode is the code provided by Public Health England) – ‘sample ID’ (this should be unique regardless of test method). The specimen ID should be a maximum of 25 characters and you should quote this ID in any communication of the sample (for example ABC-8263792).</li>
  <li>result date</li>
  <li>other – please detail if additional information is available (any other required information should be submitted through this field)</li>
</ul>

<p>COVID-19 positive and indeterminate test results must be reported within 24 hours of being detected so that timely contact tracing can be employed to prevent the onward spread of the virus and, if possible, to report multiple times per day. Diagnostic laboratories are required to notify <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> of other test results within a maximum of 7 days, but daily reporting is preferred to enable timely public health action.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notifiable-diseases-and-causative-organisms-how-to-report" class="govuk-link">Guidance for reporting notifiable diseases</a></p>

<h3>5. Relevant systems in place to report adverse test incidents</h3>

<p>The provider must be able to demonstrate that it has systems in place to identify any adverse incidents or quality control issues in respect of the test device and be able to report them in a timely manner to the relevant regulatory body. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has a dedicated COVID-19 Yellow Card portal to report adverse incidents with medicines, medical devices and diagnostics.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.GOV.UK/drug-safety-update/coronavirus-covid-19-new-dedicated-yellow-card-reporting-site-for-medicines-and-medical-devices"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> COVID-19 Yellow Card portal</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Samples shall be taken by a provider meeting or working towards ISO standard ISO15189 or ISO/IEC17025</h3>

<p><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has published target product profiles (<abbr title="target product profiles:">TPPs</abbr>) for different types of test, which outlines who should collect test samples under the ‘Target User’ description.</p>

<p>The provider must have relevant competency-based trained test operators undertaking or overseeing sample collection dependent on test sample collection requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.GOV.UK/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work/for-industry-and-manufactures-covid-19-tests-and-testing-kits" rel="external"><abbr title="target product profiles:">TPPs</abbr></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The ISO standard and technical specifications set out the key components that should be considered to provide safe and reliable sample collection service.</p>

<p>It is expected that <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation to ISO 15189 or ISO/IEC 17025 will become a mandatory minimum standard by summer 2021.</p>

<p>Sampling can be accredited as part of a wider lab-based activity, or sampling can be the scope of a standalone, separately accredited legal entity.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/" rel="external"><abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/56115.html">ISO 15189</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/66912.html" rel="external">ISO 17025</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Clinical governance</h3>
<p>The provider must have clear clinical governance procedures in place. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear governance and lines of accountability such as senior responsible officer, clinical lead, quality lead, training lead</li>
  <li>staff are appropriately trained and there is evidence of competency assessment and participation in relevant external quality assessment (<abbr title="external quality assessment">EQA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>liability and indemnity cover for staff</li>
  <li>a verification report for the laboratory element of the test (known as the assay), in line with national protocols for laboratory-based testing</li>
  <li>information management systems to monitor sample delivery and tracking</li>
  <li>systems to meet the provisions for handling, transportation and analysis of test samples</li>
  <li>working to containment level CL3 or CL2+ with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) approval for laboratory-based testing</li>
  <li>systems, processes and record management to support the delivery of safe and reliable service</li>
</ul>

<p>Private providers must tell employers of any positive results for COVID-19, and employers must inform relevant staff to self-isolate. For more information on what employers should do in the case of a positive test result, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers">employer guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>8. For <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> lab-based testing: providers shall be or use a <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>-accredited lab or applicant laboratory to either ISO 15189 (Medical Laboratories – requirements for quality and competence) or ISO/IEC 17025 (general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories)</h3>

<p>For polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) testing, all samples must be processed by a <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited laboratory, or <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> applicant laboratory (the laboratory has applied for <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation but has not yet achieved it), and have quality management systems operating according to ISO 15189 and/or ISO/IEC 17025. ISO 15189 is the standard used in all NHS laboratories.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of laboratories. This accreditation is an important element in establishing and maintaining confidence in a testing service. The government envisages that <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation will become a mandatory minimum standard for all private sector providers of COVID-19 testing by summer 2021.</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/66912.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">ISO 17025</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>9. For point-of-care testing: providers need to meet ISO standards ISO 15189 and ISO 22870 ‘point-of-care testing (<abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr>) – requirements for quality and competence’. Samples shall be processed by a <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited or applicant provider</h3>

<p>These ISO standards and technical specifications set out the key components that should be considered to provide safe and reliable <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> service.</p>

<p>It is expected that <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation to ISO 15189 and ISO 22870 will become a mandatory minimum standard by summer 2021.</p>

<p>Providers are encouraged to adhere to ISO 22583 “Guidance for supervisors and operators of point-of-care testing (<abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr>) devices”.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/71119.html" rel="external">ISO 22870</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/73506.html">Link to ISO 22583</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>10. Compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements for sample collection, processing and sharing of results including the requirements of data protection legislation</h3>

<p>The legal and regulatory requirements for private testing are set out in the guidance for employers and third-party healthcare providers below. This includes GDPR considerations.</p>

<p>The Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner's Office">ICO</abbr>) has set out FAQs on data collection and data protection relating to COVID-19 that provide further information.</p>
