<h2>The Northern Ireland Protocol</h2>

<p>The Northern Ireland Protocol is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, which came into effect on 1 January 2021. The Protocol contains provisions to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. These include the requirements which apply when placing goods on the market in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>As a result, EU legislation regulating medicines and pesticides continues to apply in Northern Ireland. UK domestic legislation applies in Great Britain. Marketing authorisations granted by the European Medicines Agency (<abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr>) continue to apply in Northern Ireland. In Great Britain, existing <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> authorisations have been replaced by UK authorisations effective in Great Britain only.</p>

<p>You can find links to guidance on medicines and pesticides regulation at the end of this page.</p>

<h2>What it means for <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificates">SPCs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Because the grant of an <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> depends upon marketing authorisations, the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> legislation reflects the effect of the Northern Ireland Protocol; this guidance explains what that means in practice.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> application can be filed based on any marketing authorisation which allows the patented product to be placed on the market in any part of the UK. Authorisations may be granted under UK or EU law and may cover the UK, Great Britain only, or Northern Ireland only. We refer to these as “UK authorisations”, “GB authorisations”, and “<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> authorisations” respectively.</p>

<p>If the application meets the statutory requirements, an <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> is granted. The protection provided by that <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> will cover the same territory as its marketing authorisation (for example, if the marketing authorisation is for Northern Ireland only, the protection will also cover Northern Ireland only).</p>

<p>If a further valid marketing authorisation for the same product covering another part of the UK is granted before the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> takes effect, then the protection provided by the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> can be expanded to cover the additional territory.</p>

<p>In each case, the authorisation must be the first authorisation for the product in its specific territory.</p>

<p>The six-month extension which can be given to an <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> for a product tested for use in children (“the paediatric extension”) remains available. The protection it provides depends on the protection provided by the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr>, and the territory of the marketing authorisation which qualifies for the extension.</p>

<h2>What you need to do</h2>

<h3>Existing rights and pending applications</h3>

<p><abbr title="Supplementary protection certificates">SPCs</abbr> that have already been granted continue to be valid. You do not need to take any action.</p>

<p>If you filed an application for an <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> before 1 January 2021, and the IPO had not yet granted or refused it by that date, the application continues unaffected. The IPO will examine your application based on a version of the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> legislation without the effects of the Protocol being applied. You can find details of this version of the legislation further below, under ‘More information’.</p>

<p>The Protocol may mean that the marketing authorisation your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> or application relies on has changed. For example, a UK marketing authorisation may have been replaced with a combination of GB and <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> authorisations. In that case, your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> or <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> application will continue as though the combination is a single authorisation. The legislation takes this into account. We may ask for the details of the replacement authorisations if they are needed for the processing of your application.</p>

<h3>Application process</h3>

<p>The Protocol does not affect the application process for an <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr>. You must submit an application to the IPO for examination, using the standard forms and paying the statutory fees. You must file your application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within six months of the marketing authorisation being granted, or</li>
  <li>within six months of the patent being granted, whichever is later</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies no matter what type of authorisation you are using, including authorisations granted by the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you have been granted more than one authorisation covering different parts of the UK when you come to file your application, you must file the application within six months of the earliest of those authorisations being granted. Otherwise, your application may be refused.</p>

<p>You must provide the number and date of all the UK, GB, or <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> authorisations granted before you file the application, as well as copies of each.</p>

<p>If you have any authorisations granted in the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) which predate the earliest of your UK, GB, or <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> authorisations, you must provide details of the earliest such authorisation. These details are needed to determine the duration of your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Applying using pre-2021 authorisations</h3>

<p>You can file <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> applications based on marketing authorisations granted before 1 January 2021. Your authorisation will be treated in the same way as a UK, GB, or <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> authorisation, and your application will be examined on the same basis.</p>

<p>But if the marketing authorisation has been changed as a result of the Protocol, you should apply based on the changed authorisation. For example, if your pre-2021 authorisation has become a combination of GB and <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> authorisations, you should apply with both authorisations and provide details of each.</p>

<h3>Examination process</h3>

<p>As part of the examination process, IPO examiners will check whether your application  meets the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the product is protected by the patent</li>
  <li>that the authorisation (UK, GB, or <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) is valid to place the product on the market</li>
  <li>that the product does not already have an <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>that the authorisation is the first authorisation for the product in its particular territory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notifying the IPO of further authorisations</h3>

<p>For the protection provided by the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> to cover additional territory, you must notify the IPO of the further authorisation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within six months of the additional authorisation being granted, and</li>
  <li>before the date your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> takes effect (that is, no later than the day your patent expires)</li>
</ul>

<p>To notify the IPO, you must submit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/marketing-authorisation-granted-after-application-for-an-spc" class="govuk-link">form SP6</a>. You must provide the IPO with the number and date of the further authorisation. You must also provide a copy of the authorisation itself.</p>

<p>If you do not provide notification, or if you provide the notification late, the protection provided by your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> will not cover that part of the UK.</p>

<p>The IPO will publish the information you provide on its register once we receive your notification. We will also publish information on the territory that the further authorisation covers.</p>

<h2>What happens when the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> takes effect</h2>

<p>Your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> will take effect at the point the basic patent expires. How long your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> lasts will be calculated based on the first authorisation to place the product on the market in the UK or anywhere in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> relies on an authorisation which only allows you to sell the product in part of the UK, then the protection provided by your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> will only extend to that territory. You will not be able to extend it further once the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> take effect. If that authorisation is later withdrawn, the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> will lapse.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> relies on more than one authorisation covering different parts of the UK, the protection provided by the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> will extend to all territories covered by those authorisations. If one of those authorisations is withdrawn, the protection provided by the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> will stop applying in that territory. If all of the authorisations are withdrawn, the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> will lapse.</p>

<h3>Paediatric extension</h3>

<p>You can request that the paediatric extension applies to your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> by filing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-to-extend-a-supplementary-protection-certificate" class="govuk-link">form SP4</a> and paying the associated fee. You must make the request no later than two years before your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> is due to expire.</p>

<p>You will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a copy of the statement in your authorisation approving the outcome of the paediatric investigation plan</li>
  <li>include information on the territory which that authorisation covers</li>
  <li>identify the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> or <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> application which the request relates to</li>
</ul>

<p>(Requests for an extension that were still pending on 1 January 2021 must also provide evidence of authorisations in the Member States of the EU.)</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> relies on more than one authorisation, you can make a single request based on all of them, or separate requests based on each one. You must file all of your requests before the two-year deadline.</p>

<p>If you make the request while the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> is in force, the paediatric extension will only apply in a territory where the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> already provides protection. The paediatric extension only extends the duration of your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr>. It does not allow the protection provided by the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> to cover additional territory on its own.</p>

<p>If you make the request before the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> takes effect, and your authorisation also allows the protection to cover additional territory, both the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> and the paediatric extension can apply in the additional territory.</p>

<p>If you only meet the requirements for the paediatric extension in part of the territory your <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> provides protection, the extension will only have effect in that part. If you meet the requirements in another part later, you will be able to make a separate request for the paediatric extension to apply in that territory by filing another form SP4. You must also make this request before the two-year deadline.</p>

<h3>Manufacturing waiver</h3>

<p>The manufacturing waiver was introduced in July 2019. It allows a third party to make an <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr>-protected product, or its ingredients, in the UK without needing the approval of the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> holder. This is only allowed where the purpose is to export the product outside of the UK or the EU, or (in the last six months of the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr>) for stockpiling to sell in the UK or the EU once the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> expires.</p>

<p>If you are a third party, you must notify the IPO and the <abbr title="Supplementary protection certificate">SPC</abbr> holder that you intend to rely upon the waiver no later than three months before starting to do so. In order to notify the IPO, you must complete and submit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notification-for-spc-manufacturing-waiver">form SP5</a>.</p>
