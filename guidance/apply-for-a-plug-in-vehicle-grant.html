<p>The plug-in vehicle grant portal allows dealers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>submit claims for vehicle grants</li>
  <li>update existing orders</li>
  <li>check the status of existing orders</li>
</ul>

<p>It is part of a secure website, developed and managed with a high level of security and data protection.</p>

<p>Customers buying a vehicle and wanting to claim for a vehicle grant do not require access the portal. Grants will be passed onto them by dealers at point of purchase.</p>

<p><a class="gem-c-button govuk-button govuk-button--start" draggable="false" href="https://www.apply-plug-in-vehicle-grant.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in" role="button"> Log into the portal <svg class="govuk-button__start-icon govuk-!-display-none-print" focusable="false" height="19" viewBox="0 0 33 40" width="17.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h13l20 20-20 20H0l20-20z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></a></p>

<h2>Before logging in</h2>

<p>You will need to read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal-guidance">user guidance for the plug-in grant portal</a>
</li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-motorcycle-grant-eligibility">plug-in motorcycle grant: eligibility and applications</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To raise a new order, you will need your dealership reference number.</p>

<p>To search for an existing order, you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your plug-in grant application number</li>
  <li>your in-house reference number</li>
  <li>the customer’s name or vehicle registration number</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the portal for the first time</h2>

<p>Manufacturers new to the scheme need to email the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>) at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:plugingrants@dft.gov.uk">plugingrants@dft.gov.uk</a> to request portal credentials and permissions.</p>

<p>New dealerships should speak to their manufacturer to have appropriate access created for them to log into the portal.</p>

<p>Once set up with an account, click forgotten password and follow the instructions when you log in for the first time. Your username is your email address.</p>

<p>All new user account requests must be received directly from manufacturers. There is no limit to the number of administrative users that can be linked to one dealer account.</p>

<p>Dealers should ensure that there are sufficient staff with access to and knowledge of how to use the portal to enable management of orders at all times.</p>

<p>Each portal administrator must have their own individual user account. Usernames and passwords should not be shared as this is a breach of security and data protection.</p>

<p>Ensure accounts are linked to the portal user’s own email address which is monitored regularly.</p>

<p>User accounts can only be linked to one dealer account at a time. There is no facility to create multi-dealer access. Users that require access to more than one dealer account are required to provide additional email addresses to create new user accounts.</p>

<p>To access the portal, javascript will need to be enabled on the browser.</p>

<h2>Before you enter a grant into the portal</h2>

<p>You must ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the end customer has not exceeded <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal-guidance/using-the-plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal#customer-grant-limits">grant limits per customer</a>
</li>
  <li>for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal-guidance/using-the-plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal#supplementary-evidence">multistage builds applying via route 2</a>, Form D must be provided to the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> before entering the order onto the portal</li>
  <li>for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal-guidance/using-the-plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal#supplementary-evidence">wheelchair accessible vehicle conversions</a>, information on the conversion must be provided to the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> before entering the order onto the portal</li>
</ul>

<p>Dealers can add up to 10 vehicles per application. Note that if one vehicle is cancelled, all vehicles in that application will be cancelled.</p>

<h2>Starting a new application</h2>

<p>Click on Start new grant application at the top of the vehicle dashboard.</p>

<p>You will need to provide information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the transaction is a lease purchase and, if so, provide the lease company details (this includes Motability orders)</li>
  <li>whether the vehicle is being purchased on finance and, if so, provide the finance company details</li>
  <li>the type of sale (private, business, fleet, sole trader or demonstrator)</li>
  <li>for taxi orders, the location the taxi will be operating from</li>
  <li>end customer details</li>
  <li>vehicle details</li>
  <li>expected delivery date</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal-guidance/using-the-plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal#definition-of-price">purchase price</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Orders should correlate with the invoice details. Therefore, it is important that a final price has already been agreed and the grant applied.</p>

<p>When the purchase price is entered, the grant rate will be automatically calculated. It is the dealer’s responsibility to review the grant value to ensure the correct amount has been returned.</p>

<p>End customer details must be the individual or business receiving the vehicle. They cannot be the lease company (or Motability) details. Ensure these are entered correctly as they cannot be amended once the order has been placed.</p>

<p>Orders cannot be transferred from different keepers. If end customer details change, the order must be cancelled and reapplied for.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to request supporting evidence to confirm end customer details provided are accurate, and that orders are for the sole use of the business in question.</p>

<p>A demonstrator is a vehicle sold (wholesale) to either an independent dealer or a dealer owned by the manufacturer. The purpose of these vehicles is to allow potential customers to experience test drives.</p>

<h2>Updating a grant application</h2>

<p>It is the dealer’s responsibility to keep orders updated and monitor them throughout the delivery process.</p>

<p>Dealers will need to obtain and provide information based on the status of the order as it progresses. This includes the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicle identification number (<abbr title="vehicle identification number">VIN</abbr>)</li>
  <li>vehicle registration mark (<abbr title="Vehicle registrations mark">VRM</abbr>)</li>
  <li>date of registration</li>
  <li>actual delivery date</li>
  <li>taxi licence number (for taxis only)</li>
</ul>

<p>The taxi licence number is the taxi plate number displayed on hackney carriage or private hire vehicles.</p>

<p>Orders for demonstrator vehicles should enter demo in this field.</p>

<h2>Order status</h2>

<p>As an order progresses, its status will change. Dealers should track the status on the dashboard overview.</p>

<p>Dealerships outside your business group will not be able to see your orders.</p>

<p>You can click on the order ID for an overview of the application. A description will be given on what information is required for the application to progress to the next stage.</p>

<h4>In pipeline</h4>
<p>The order has been created before the vehicle identification number (<abbr title="vehicle identification number">VIN</abbr>) has been attributed to the order.</p>

<h4>Awaiting registration</h4>
<p>The order has had the <abbr title="vehicle identification number">VIN</abbr> assigned. Vehicle registrations mark (<abbr title="Vehicle registrations mark">VRM</abbr>) and the date of first registration are awaiting attribution. Orders should remain in this status until registration with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) is complete.</p>

<h4>Awaiting validation</h4>
<p>Once vehicles are registered with <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>, the vehicle details given in the order are checked against the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> vehicles record database.</p>

<h4>Failed validation</h4>
<p>The order has failed validations checks against the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> vehicles record database. The dealer will be notified with reasons explaining why the order failed validation.</p>

<p>Orders containing up to 3 vehicles will undergo real-time validation.</p>

<p>Orders of more than 3 vehicles will undergo an overnight check against <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>’s vehicles enquiry service (<abbr title="vehicles enquiry service">VES</abbr>).</p>

<p>Orders will not progress to the next status until all vehicles in the order have been successfully validated.</p>

<h4>Passed validation</h4>
<p>A transient state where the order has passed validation and before it moves on to pending delivery.</p>

<h4>Pending delivery</h4>
<p>After the vehicle(s) order has been validated against the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> vehicles record database but before an actual delivery date has been assigned to the order.</p>

<h4>Awaiting casework</h4>
<p>Where an order has failed validation several times, requires review or the order has been submitted prior to the completion of vehicle registration with <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Orders cannot be checked against the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> vehicles record database over the weekend.</p>

<p>If the vehicle is registered and details provided on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, the vehicle may fall to awaiting casework status by the Monday.</p>

<p>The portal administrators regularly review orders in awaiting casework and will provide instructions to dealers on any required amendments.</p>

<h4>Awaiting payment</h4>
<p>All required information needed to facilitate grant payments has now been entered successfully onto the portal (<abbr title="vehicle identification number">VIN</abbr>, <abbr title="Vehicle registrations mark">VRM</abbr>, date of first registration and actual delivery date).</p>

<p>The order has now moved into a state waiting for the payment process to be actioned.</p>

<h4>Completed</h4>
<p>The payment file has been generated and is awaiting action by the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) to pay manufacturers.</p>

<h4>Awaiting audit</h4>
<p>The order has been selected for audit and is waiting for the dealership to email invoices to the scheme administrators. Invoices must be submitted within 28 days of reaching this status. The email address is <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInVehicleGrant@dvla.gov.uk">PlugInVehicleGrant@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>Audit in progress</h4>
<p>The scheme administrators have received the required invoice documentation and are in the process of auditing the order.</p>

<h4>Audit success</h4>
<p>The order has successfully passed audit and may proceed to entering remaining information to complete the order.</p>

<h4>Audit rejected</h4>
<p>The order has failed audit. Dealers will receive email notification explaining the reasons for failure and the required action.</p>

<h4>On hold</h4>
<p>The order has not had <abbr title="Vehicle registrations mark">VRM</abbr> or date of first registration details entered within 9 months of the order being created.</p>

<p>Orders will normally enter on hold status once they have been in the system for more than 9 months.</p>

<p>Such orders will not be reinstated except in exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> or if an extension to the usual 9-month deadline has been granted.</p>

<p>Dealers will need to email the scheme administrators at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInVehicleGrant@dvla.gov.uk">PlugInVehicleGrant@dvla.gov.uk</a> to request the order is taken off hold.</p>

<h4>Cancelled</h4>
<p>The dealer or <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> has cancelled the order.</p>

<h2>How to update an order</h2>

<p>To update an order with new information, search for the order in the overview dashboard and click on the Order ID to make any updates. The dashboard can be filtered by date or status.</p>

<p>Navigate to the bottom of the overview and press Open all. This will allow you to enter the next required piece of information.</p>

<h2>Payment of grants</h2>

<p>At the end of each month, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will check with manufacturers that order details are correct.</p>

<p>If there are any discrepancies, a manufacturer may push orders back to an earlier status and dealers should confer with their manufacturer to check and resolve issues.</p>

<p>Once any issues have been resolved, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will process respective payments so that dealers may be reimbursed for grant payments.</p>

<h2>If you need help</h2>

<p>To communicate with administrators of the system, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInVehicleGrant@dvla.gov.uk">PlugInVehicleGrant@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Administrators will respond within 5 working days for enquiries and 10 days for audits.</p>

<p>The claim system email address is monitored daily excluding weekends and bank holidays.</p>

<p>Contact your manufacturer if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your dealership is not registered on the system</li>
  <li>you are unsure what information to put into the fields relating to make or model of the vehicle</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you are locked out of the system</h2>

<p>If your login details are not recognised after several attempts, the system will automatically lock you out.</p>

<p>After 30 minutes you will be able to attempt login again. During this time, you will not be able to reset your password.</p>

<p>If you are still unable to login after 30 minutes, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInVehicleGrant@dvla.gov.uk">PlugInVehicleGrant@dvla.gov.uk</a> to have your account unlocked.</p>
