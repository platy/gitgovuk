<h2 id="if-theres-a-no-deal-brexit">If there’s a no deal Brexit</h2>

<p>You’ll need to follow different processes to import and export animals and animal products to and from the EU.</p>

<h3 id="imports-into-the-uk">Imports into the UK</h3>

<p>You must continue to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eu-import-of-animals-and-products-notify-authorities">notify the Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>)</a> if you plan to import into England, Scotland or Wales.</p>

<h3 id="exports-out-of-the-uk">Exports out of the UK</h3>

<p>You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates">apply for an export health certificate</a> (<abbr title="Export health certificate">EHC</abbr>) if you’re exporting animals (including fish) or animal products to the EU from the UK.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-animals-animal-products-fish-and-fishery-products-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal">what exporters need to do to prepare for a no deal Brexit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="current-rules-on-international-trade">Current rules on international trade</h2>

<p>If you trade internationally in animals and certain animal products, you need to follow particular animal health regulations. While these products are traded freely within the EU, responsibility lies with each member state to ensure that products meet the common animal and public health standards.</p>

<p>The Trade Control and Expert System (<abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>) is a web-based system run by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection. It aims to make the paperwork for trading in animals and animal products easier by generating the necessary documents and sending copies to the appropriate authorities inland and abroad, saving traders time and effort.</p>

<p>The system allows traders to obtain export health certificates and movement notifications of their dispatches. It helps the authorities to meet health regulations and traders’ needs.</p>

<p>Read the guide on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-products-import-and-export">Animals and animal products: international trade regulations
</a> for more information on animals and animal products.</p>

<h2 id="what-traces-does">What <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> does</h2>

<p>If you trade internationally in animals or certain animal products, the documentation you need to submit is processed through <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="eu-documentation-processed-through-traces">EU documentation processed through <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you buy certain animal products, live animals or germplasm from within the EU or trade in them with another EU country, you need a health certificate signed by a government-approved official veterinarian or, for some animal products, commercial documentation. The health certificates, known as Intra Trade Animal Health Certificates (<abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificates">ITAHCs</abbr>), are issued through <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#customer-service-centres-csc"><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> in Carlisle.</p>

<p>Find <a rel="external" href="http://apha.defra.gov.uk/External_OV_Instructions/Export_Instructions/Certification_Procedures/Intra_Trade_Animal_Health_Certificates.htm">guidance on how to complete an <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr> on the <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Importers may also need a Common Veterinary Entry Document (<abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>), which gives a veterinary assessment of live animals or products.</p>

<p>For trade with another EU member state, you or your agent must provide details of the consignment to your local <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> office. The <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> - which is an agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) - provides details of the veterinary assessment on the consignment and creates the certificate. Imports are notified through <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> and details of the <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr> are also entered on the system.</p>

<p>Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">contact details for your local <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> office on the <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>  website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="non-eu-documentation-processed-through-traces">Non-EU documentation processed through <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>
</h3>

<p>If you trade in animals or certain animal products from outside the EU, you will need to notify the Border Inspection Post (<abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>) by completing documentation on the <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> system. Certain non-EU countries including Switzerland, Chile and New Zealand access health certificates for import into the EU and submit them electronically through <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="animals-and-animal-products-cleared-through-traces">Animals and animal products cleared through <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The system covers several types of animal and animal product, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>germplasm, for example semen, ova and embryos of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and horses</li>
  <li>types of poultry, such as hatching eggs, day-old chicks, poultry for restocking game supplies and birds for breeding, production and slaughter</li>
  <li>live animals, for example horses, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, parrots, hares and certain species of non-domestic ungulates</li>
  <li>primates</li>
  <li>carnivores, for example dogs and cats (excluding accompanied PETS-compliant animals)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you import products of animal origin from outside the EU, you must notify the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> that goods are arriving. Do this  by completing part I of a <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> on <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>.</p>

<p>When you complete and submit this document online, you will be issued a unique <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr> reference number. You will need to provide this number to customs authorities to demonstrate that you have notified the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> and to allow subsequent release.</p>

<p>Exports to non-EU member states (and some exports to Switzerland and Norway) are processed through a different system called <abbr title="Certification of Exports, Notification of Trade and Assessment of Underlying Risk">CENTAUR</abbr> (Certification of Exports, Notification of Trade and Assessment of Underlying Risk), but all enquiries and applications to export should be directed to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> is not yet able to handle health certificates issued by countries outside the EU. You will need to submit these documents in hard-copy form to the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>If for any reason you cannot notify the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> of the arrival of the goods using <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>, you must send a copy of a completed <abbr title="Common Veterinary Entry Document">CVED</abbr>, part I, to the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>. If you do not pre-notify the <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> of the arrival of the goods, then the goods might be rejected for import. If the goods are rejected, you will have to have them destroyed or returned to the country of origin at your own expense.</p>

<h2 id="registering-for-traces">Registering for <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You need to register to use <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>. Your single registration on <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> will be either for trading within the EU or for importing from non-EU countries. You cannot register for both with the same email address.</p>

<p>There’s no charge for using the system. If your business is a large company with several sites, you may have to register with the relevant <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> office in each of your branch areas.</p>

<p>Find <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">contact details for your local <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> office</a>.</p>

<h3 id="eu-imports">EU imports</h3>

<p>You can register for <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> online.</p>

<p>If you want to trade within the EU, you should fill out the fields for Competent Authority, which in the UK is the local <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> office.</p>

<p>Once your registration to trade with other EU countries has been confirmed, you can then apply for an <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr> via the <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> website.</p>

<h3 id="non-eu-imports">Non-EU imports</h3>

<p>If you want to import from outside the EU you should fill out the fields for <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Once your registration as an importer of non-EU goods has been confirmed you can then apply for a Common Veterinary Entry Document via the <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> website.</p>

<p>A single registration with a <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr> allows you to import via any <abbr title="Border Inspection Post">BIP</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="using-traces">Using <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>

<p>You can also apply for an <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr> by manually completing a printed form and sending this through to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#customer-service-centres-csc"><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a>, who will put this into <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="action-for-ovs-on-completion-of-itahcs">Action for OVs on completion of <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificates">ITAHCs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You must fax or deliver a copy of the completed <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr> and <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>-CONF document to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> in Carlisle the same day the <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr> is signed. The fax number for <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> is 0208 0260 498.</p>

<p>To avoid delays, or the goods being seized or rejected, it’s important to get the right <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr> for a consignment. Detailed guidance on how to certify the health certificates is given in the Notes for Guidance supplied with the <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr>, as well as the checklist (where necessary) and the footnotes above the signature box.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-authorities-use-traces">How the authorities use <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Veterinary authorities from the UK and abroad use <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> to track the movement of consignments across Europe.</p>

<p>The system sends the <abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr> via <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> as a notification to the destination authorities for each consignment.</p>

<p>For third-country (countries outside the EU) imports, the importer can use <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr> to notify the Border Inspection Post.</p>

<p>You will need to notify HMRC that veterinary checks have been completed for third-country imports or your customs entry will not be processed.</p>
