<p>There is a visitors car park, including spaces for Blue Badge holders.</p>

<h3>Entering Prescoed</h3>
<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>Visitors should dress appropriately. You may be turned away if you are wearing items like revealing clothing or clothing with offensive slogans. Ask at the visitors centre if you have questions about appropriate dress.</p>

<p>Each adult visitor is allowed to take in a maximum of £20 which can be used to buy food and drink from the coffee shop in the visiting hall.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Prescoed. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Prescoed</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a resident during their time at Prescoed.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>
<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Residents do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family from 6am to 11:55pm, daily. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Prescoed using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the resident, depending on the rules at Prescoed.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Prescoed</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast online service to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can also send postal orders and cheques. These should be made payable to ‘NOMS Agency’ and include the resident’s name and prisoner number on the back.</p>
