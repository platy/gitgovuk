<h3>Entering Stoke Heath</h3>
<p>When you first arrive at Stoke Heath, you should check in at the visitors centre.</p>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  Read the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">acceptable forms of <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> when visiting a prison</a>.</p>

<p>Visitors should dress appropriately. You may be turned away if you are wearing items like revealing clothing or clothing with offensive slogans.</p>

<p>Stoke Heath has a family-friendly dress code which means visitors should dress appropriately.

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their cells so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
