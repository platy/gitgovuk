<h3>Gamebirds</h3>

<p>The code of practice for the welfare of gamebirds was approved by Parliament and came into force in January 2011. The code provides game farmers with information on how to meet the welfare needs of their animals, as required under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. It can also be used in courts as evidence in cases brought before them relating to poor welfare of gamebirds.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Fish</h3>

<p>In addition to the general requirements of the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 we are working towards further improvements in fish welfare by other means.</p>

<p>The Council of Europeâ€™s Standing Committee on the welfare of animals kept for farming purposes adopted a recommendation on fish in December 2005. Defraâ€™s research and development programme includes projects on certain aspects of fish welfare. We will use the findings to support our objective to ensure high standards of fish welfare.</p>

<h3>Ducks and geese</h3>

<p>The welfare of ducks and geese is protected by the general requirements of the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007. There is also a Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Ducks, which continues to apply under the new Animal Welfare Act.</p>

<h3>Rabbits</h3>

<p>The welfare of rabbits is protected by the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007. Schedule 9 of these regulations contains specific conditions that apply to the keeping of rabbits. There is also a Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Rabbits, which continues to apply under the new Animal Welfare Act.</p>

<p>As there is no longer an industry body for commercial rabbit keepers, we would welcome commercial farmers contacting us via: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:animal.welfare@defra.gov.uk">animal.welfare@defra.gov.uk</a> to give their details for future consultation.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Turkeys</h3>

<p>The welfare of turkeys are protected by the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007. There is also a Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Turkeys which continues to apply under the new Animal Welfare Act.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Ratites (emu, ostrich, rhea)</h3>

<p>The farming of emu, ostrich and rhea (ratites) caters for a niche market in the UK. The welfare of ratites are protected by the general requirements in the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007. There are also Council of Europe recommendations on the welfare of farmed ratites which offer guidance on the standards that should apply.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.coe.int/t/e/legal_affairs/legal_co-operation/biological_safety_and_use_of_animals/farming/Rec%20ratites%20E.asp#TopOfPage" rel="external">Council of Europe recommendations on the welfare of farmed ratites</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The existing Codes of Recommendations for the welfare of livestock continue to apply, however, with the introduction of the Act and the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007, the references to the legislation throughout the code are now out of date. Whilst the vast majority of the 2000 regulations are replicated by the 2007 regulations, you should check the legislation as it currently stands.</p>

<h2>Legislation</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/45/contents" rel="external">Animal Welfare Act 2006</a> (the 2006 Act) is the principal law relating to animal welfare.</p>

<p>Owners and keepers have a duty of care to their animals and must make sure they meet their needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for a suitable environment and place to live</li>
  <li>for a suitable diet</li>
  <li>to exhibit normal behaviour patterns</li>
  <li>to be housed with, or apart from, other animals (if applicable)</li>
  <li>to be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone who does not provide for an animalâ€™s welfare needs may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be banned from owning animals</li>
  <li>face an unlimited fine</li>
  <li>be sent to prison for up to 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2006 Act also sets out offences relating to cruelty and animal fighting. The maximum sentence for these offences is 5 years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.</p>

<p>Animal cruelty includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>causing unnecessary suffering to an animal</li>
  <li>mutilation</li>
  <li>docking the tail of a dog except where permitted</li>
  <li>poisoning an animal</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2006 Act applies to all vertebrate animals.</p>

<p>The welfare of farmed animals is additionally protected by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2078/contents/made" rel="external">The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007</a> (as amended), which are made under the Animal Welfare Act.</p>

<p>The welfare of all farmed animals is protected by the Animal Welfare Act 2006 which makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to any animal. The Act also contains a duty of care to animals - anyone responsible for an animal must take reasonable steps to make sure the animalâ€™s welfare needs are met.</p>

<p>The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 set minimum standards for all farm animals. These regulations replaced the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 on 1 October 2007. The new regulations are made under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and are very similar to the previous regulations.</p>

</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1990/2628/contents/made" rel="external">The Welfare of Animals at Markets Order 1990</a> (WAMO) contains rules covering the treatment of animals in markets to ensure they are not caused injury or unnecessary suffering. They also set out detailed arrangements in respect of penning, food and water and the care of young animals. Responsibility for enforcing WAMO rests with local councils.</p>

<p>The welfare of farmed animals is additionally protected by the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 as amended (S.I. 2007 No.2078), which are made under the Animal Welfare Act.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>These regulations continue to implement EU directives on the welfare of calves, pigs, laying hens, conventionally reared meat chickens and a general welfare framework directive, which sets down minimum standards for the protection of all farmed livestock.</p>

<p>The regulations cover all farmed animals. Schedule 1 (which does not apply to fish, reptiles or amphibians) contains specific requirements such as inspections, record keeping, freedom of movement, buildings and equipment and the feeding and watering of animals. Some species, however, are subject to additional provisions, which are set out in Schedules 2-9.</p>

<p>Guidance has been prepared to accompany the regulations and includes information on the application of the legislation to common land. Interim guidance whilst the relevant code of recommendations is under review, is available on the rules on conventionally reared meat chicken.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Amsterdam in June 1997 contains a legally binding protocol recognising that animals are sentient beings and requires full regard to be paid to their welfare when policies relating to agriculture, transport, research and the internal market are formulated or implemented.</p>

<h2>European conventions on animal welfare</h2>

<p>The Council of Europe (CoE) has 5 conventions covering animal welfare including one on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/087" rel="external">European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The underlying principle of the convention, and its recommendations on the welfare of individual species of livestock, is to set out the conditions necessary to avoid any unnecessary suffering or injury and to take account of physiological and behavioural needs. Current Council of Europe recommendations are listed below.</p>

<h2>Animal welfare during transport</h2>

<p>The welfare of animals during transport is protected by retained EU legislation.</p>

<p>You must transport animals in a way that is not likely to cause injury or undue suffering to them.</p>

<p>Read guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/keeping-farm-animals-and-horses-in-extreme-weather">transporting and caring for animals in extreme weather</a>.</p>

<p>When you transport animals you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plan the journey properly and keep it as short as possible</li>
  <li>check the animals during the journey to make sure you meet their needs for water, feed and rest</li>
  <li>make sure the animals are fit to travel</li>
  <li>design, construct and maintain the vehicle and loading and unloading facilities to avoid injury and suffering</li>
  <li>make sure anyone handling the animals are trained or competent in the task and do not use violence or any methods likely to cause unnecessary fear, injury or suffering</li>
  <li>give the animals sufficient floor space and height</li>
</ul>

<p>Legislation on the protection of animals during transport applies to the transport of live vertebrate animals in connection with an economic activity (a business or trade). This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>livestock and equine hauliers</li>
  <li>farmers</li>
  <li>commercial pet breeders and rescue organisations</li>
  <li>pet couriers</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirements apply to those working at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>markets</li>
  <li>assembly centres</li>
  <li>slaughterhouses</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirements do not&nbsp;apply to the transport of animals where this is not in connection with economy activity. For example, journeys which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not in the course of business or trade</li>
  <li>not for hire or reward</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>Welfare during transport is enforced by local councils. Trading standards officials carry out welfare checks on animals and means of transport. They will take appropriate enforcement action up to and including prosecution.</p>

<p>The Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) carries out checks at markets, ports, roadside and at supervised loadings of export consignments. They enforce compliance with journey times through checks of journey documentation.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about the treatment of an animal during transport <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">contact the local council</a> (normally the trading standards department) or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#animal-health-and-welfare-services"><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Animals transported by air</h3>

<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) sets out the requirements for transporting animals by air. Information on air transport and container requirements can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/cargo/live-animals/" rel="external">IATA website</a> on live animal regulations.</p>

<h2>Transporting animals in Great Britain</h2>

<p>When you transport animals commercially by air, sea, rail or road in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) you must have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#transporter-authorisations">transporter authorisation.</a> This can be issued in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man .</p>

<p>To transport animals by road, you'll also need the following documents issued in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="#vehicle-approval">certificate of vehicle approval</a> for journeys over 8 hours</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="#certificate-of-competence">certificate of competence</a> or to <a class="govuk-link" href="#training">complete training</a> for livestock, equines and poultry</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="#journey-logs">journey log</a> for imports, exports or transits of livestock and unregistered equines on journeys over 8 hours</li>
  <li>an <a class="govuk-link" href="#animal-transport-certificates">animal transport certificate</a> for all journeys not covered by a journey log</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transporter authorisations</h2>

<p>You must have a transporter authorisation if you transport animals as part of an economic activity (a business or trade), for a distance over 65km.</p>

<p>You will need a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type 1 transporter authorisation for journeys over 65km and up to 8 hours</li>
  <li>type 2 transporter authorisation for journeys over 8 hours</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get a transporter authorisation</h3>

<p>You need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#animal-transport">contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>â€™s Welfare in Transport team</a> for a transporter authorisation application pack. This will include the forms you need to submit, and guidance on what to include in your application.</p>

<p>In your application you will need to declare any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Home Office simple cautions or convictions under legislation on the protection of animals</li>
  <li>current court orders restricting ownership, keeping or being in control of animals</li>
</ul>

<p>This declaration includes you and anyone transporting animals under the authority of your Authorisation. Anyone who has been convicted or given a Home Office simple caution under such legislation, in the 3 years before their application, will normally be refused an authorisation.</p>

<h3>Irish certificates of competence</h3>

<p>Under the common travel area, Irish and British citizens can move freely and reside in either jurisdiction and enjoy associated rights and entitlements.</p>

<p>Defra will recognise training carried out in Ireland for the purpose of granting driver and attendant certificates of competence.</p>

<p>If you have an Irish certificate of competence, you can apply to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> by completing an application form. Youâ€™ll need to provide a copy of your training and assessment, and your valid certificate of competence.</p>

<p>If you have a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> certificate of competence and want to apply to the <abbr title="Republic of Ireland">RoI</abbr>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-agriculture-food-and-the-marine/" rel="external">contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (<abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine">DAFM</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h2>Journey logs</h2>

<p>If you import, export or transit cattle, sheep, pigs, goats or unregistered horses you must have both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK issued journey log - issued by either DAERA or <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an EU issued journey log</li>
</ul>

<p>If you depart from Great Britain you must get a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/journey-log">journey log</a> approved by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle"><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> Centre for International Trade - Carlisle</a> before the journey starts.</p>

<p>If you depart from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>, you must get a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/journey-logs" rel="external">journey log approved by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA)</a> before the journey starts.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re exporting to the EU you must get an EU journey log from the competent authority of the first point of entry into the EU.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re importing from the EU to the UK or transiting Great Britain you must get an EU journey log from the competent authority in the country of origin in the EU.</p>

<h2>Animal transport certificates</h2>

<p>For all other journeys where a journey log is not required, you need an animal transport certificate. This includes for journeys of any distance or duration, and for all species of animals.</p>

<p>An animal transport certificate records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>origin and ownership of animals</li>
  <li>place of departure and destination</li>
  <li>date and time of departure</li>
  <li>expected duration of journey</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#animal-transport">Contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>â€™s Welfare in Transport team</a> for an animal transport certificate template.</p>

<h2>Contingency plans</h2>

<p>If you have a type 2 transporter authorisation, you must have contingency plans to deal with emergencies that can arise during a journey. For example, animals falling ill or getting injured, unforeseen delays, breakdowns or accidents.</p>

<p>You need to submit a contingency plan with your type 2 transporter authorisation application. <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will provide a template as part of your application pack.</p>

<p>You must document your contingency plans and make them available to the competent authority on request.</p>

<p>Journey organisers need to submit a contingency plan with each new application for a journey log. <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will give you a form to complete along with your journey log application.</p>

<p>In the case of multiple pick-ups and drop-offs you only need one contingency plan to cover the whole journey. In instances where loads are split, for example at a control post before onward travel to the destination on separate vehicles, only one contingency plan is required but separate instructions may be needed following the consignment being split.</p>

<p>For further guidance on contingency plans <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#animal-transport">contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>â€™s Welfare in Transport team</a>.</p>

<h2>Transporting animals into the EU</h2>

<p>UK issued transporter authorisations, certificates of competence and certificates of vehicle approval are not valid for use in the EU.</p>

<p>To transport live animals into the EU, in addition to holding UK documents, UK transporters must apply to an EU member state for a transporter authorisation.</p>

<p>You will need to be represented in the relevant member state. The term representation is not defined in the legislation. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the relevant competent authority for the member state you wish to apply to</li>
  <li>seek independent legal advice, specific to your business</li>
  <li>discuss directly with your relevant trade organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only hold an authorisation in one member state.</p>

<p>When you apply for an EU issued transporter authorisation you need to submit any required certificate of vehicle approval and certificate of competence. All certificates need to be issued by an EU member state. Great Britain issued certificates are not valid.</p>

<p>You can get contact details for member states to which you wish to apply through the relevant Border Control Posts (<abbr title="Border Control Posts">BCPs</abbr>).</p>

<p>Live animals may be required to enter the EU through an approved <abbr title="Border Control Post">BCP</abbr>.  Find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://food.ec.europa.eu/animals/veterinary-border-control/designated-border-control-posts-bcps_en" rel="external">list of approved <abbr title="Border Control Posts">BCPs</abbr></a>.</p>
