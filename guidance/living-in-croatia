<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/croatia/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Croatia</a>.</p>

<p>You must register as a Croatian resident if you plan to stay in Croatia for more than 3 months. Find out <a rel="external" href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/stay-of-aliens/granting-stay-in-croatia-/">how to register</a> your temporary residence with the local police station and what documentation is required. The Croatian government has more guidance on temporary residents.</p>

<h3 id="residency-and-visas-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency and visas after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You must register as a resident if you intend to stay in Croatia for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://mup.gov.hr/vijesti/information-concerning-the-future-relations-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union/283273">Croatian Government guidance on the UKâ€™s departure from the EU for UK nationals in Croatia</a>.</p>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available. You should sign up for our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-croatia">email alerts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Croatia</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or â€˜emergency passportâ€™</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a>  before you book your trip. 
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be new travel rules.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission has said you <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6402_en.htm">may not need visas for short stays</a> elsewhere in the Schengen area or the EU. You may be able to stay for up to 90 days in any EU country, within a 180 day period without a visa.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>The Croatian government has more information on <a rel="external" href="https://mup.gov.hr/vijesti/information-concerning-the-future-relations-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union/283273">passports and travel after the UKâ€™s departure from the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You need to make sure you are correctly registered for healthcare as a resident in Croatia. The NHS has more information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-croatia/">healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Croatia</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Croatia and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Croatia.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">read our travel advice pages</a> and  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">the NHSâ€™s guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-facilities-in-croatia">find English-speaking doctors in Croatia</a>. You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check that your prescriptions are legal in Croatia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Croatia will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in Croatia.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/other/brexit/information-for-citizens/">Croatian Government</a> is preparing a Draft Law Proposal on health insurance to provide healthcare arrangements after the UK leaves the EU to those who are residents in Croatia. We will update this guidance with further information as soon as it becomes available.</p>

<p>The UK has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Croatia for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020.  If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and there is no arrangement with Croatia to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>You should take action now <a rel="external" href="https://mup.gov.hr/aliens-281621/281621">to confirm your residency status</a> and decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. UK nationals will be able to return to UK for treatment.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal, however this is reliant on Croatia continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>You should read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-croatia/">the NHS guidance on healthcare for UK nationals in Croatia and how it may change after UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-croatia">Working in Croatia</h2>

<p>You can read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.
You may need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">apply for a UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-croatia-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Croatia after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves with a deal, your right to work will not change until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/croatia-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Croatia to make sure that people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">telling HMRC if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a></li>

</ul>

<p>The Ministry of Finance has information about custom services and declarations of goods in Croatia.</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in Croatia. You can find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/croatia-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer in Croatia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance</a> while abroad in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK leaving the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Croatia. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation relief to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.porezna-uprava.hr/en/Pages/default.aspx">relevant tax authority</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the EU.

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Croatia, you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">UK State Pension</a> or  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension">new UK State Pension</a>. Please <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">contact the International Pensions Centre</a> to claim</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="life-certificates">Life certificates</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">â€˜life certificateâ€™ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you must respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you donâ€™t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Pensions after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay the UK State Pension to those eligible after the UK leaves the EU. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions</a>.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Croatia, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Croatian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, The Croatian Government, Ministry of Labour and Pensions has stated that if you have regulated your residence in Croatia before the UK leaves the EU, you will continue to have Croatian pension rights after the UK leaves the EU. We will update this guidance when there is a formal agreement on this.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Croatia. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">read our guidance on which benefits you can claim if you live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">use our tool to check which benefits you can claim while youâ€™re abroad</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re abroad for more than 4 weeks, many income-related benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit cannot be paid to you.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time youâ€™ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="croatian-benefits">Croatian benefits</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to Croatian benefits. To find out if you are entitled to Croatian benefits and how to claim, check <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1104&langId=en">Croatian social security benefits</a>.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Benefits after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay child benefits, and disability benefits to those eligible in the EU after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Croatia, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Croatian contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the Croatian Government has proposed that those with permanent residence in Croatia will be able to continue to receive social benefits. We will update this guidance when there is a formal agreement on this.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you can read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-croatia">Driving in Croatia</h2>

<p>You should exchange your UK licence for a Croatian driving licence before the UK leaves the EU, as your UK licence may no longer be valid after the UK leaves the EU. You can still use your Croatian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>You should exchange your driving licence at the nearest police station. You can do this if you have either an approved temporary or permanent residence in Croatia.</p>

<p>To exchange your licence, you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your original UK driving licence and translation</li>
  <li>payment slip</li>
  <li>administrative fee</li>
  <li>a photograph that is 35 x 45 mm</li>
</ul>
