<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-brexit">Passports and travel after Brexit</h3>

<p>After Brexit the rules on travel will change. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-for-travel-to-europe">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. Youâ€™ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. During this time you can continue to travel freely in the EU with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new travel rules will apply. You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, <a rel="external" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/04/09/visa-free-travel-after-brexit-council-adopts-regulation/">UK nationals will not need visas for short stays elsewhere in the EU.</a> You will be able to stay up to 90 days in another EU, EEA or EFTA country, within a 180-day period. You must retain evidence of travel (such as train and plane tickets), in case these are requested by national authorities. If you hold a residence permit from an EU, EEA or EFTA country, you will be able to transit through other EU, EEA or EFTA countries to reach your country of residence.</p>

<p>The Croatian government has more information on <a rel="external" href="https://mup.gov.hr/vijesti/information-concerning-the-future-relations-between-the-united-kingdom-and-the-european-union/283273">passports and travel after Brexit.</a></p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>Make sure you are correctly registered for healthcare as a resident in Croatia. The NHS has more information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-croatia/">healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Croatia</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Croatia and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You must apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia, you should not use a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Croatia.</p>

<p>When you travel from Croatia for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">read our travel advice pages</a> and  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a student, read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">the NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad.</a></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-facilities-in-croatia">find English-speaking doctors in Croatia. </a></p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check that your prescriptions are legal in Croatia.</a></p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-brexit">Healthcare after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in Croatia will remain the same until the end of the implementation period, as long as you remain a resident in Croatia.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, your access to healthcare may change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/other/brexit/information-for-citizens/">Croatian Government</a> is preparing a Draft Law Proposal on health insurance to provide healthcare arrangements after the UK leaves the EU to those who are residents in Croatia. We will update this guidance with further information as soon as it becomes available.</p>

<p>The UK has proposed maintaining current healthcare cooperation with Croatia for S1 form holders until the end of December 2020. If thereâ€™s no deal, and there is no arrangement with Croatia to continue reciprocal healthcare, those receiving coverage through the S1 form will not be covered.</p>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://mup.gov.hr/aliens-281621/281621">confirm your residency status</a> and decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the UK leaves without a deal. UK nationals will be able to return to UK for treatment.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid if thereâ€™s no deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme if thereâ€™s no deal. However, this is reliant on Croatia continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>You should read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-croatia/">the NHS guidance on healthcare for UK nationals in Croatia and how it may change after Brexit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-croatia">Working in Croatia</h2>

<p>You can read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.
You may need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">apply for a UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-croatia-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Croatia after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If there is a deal, your right to work will not change until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/croatia-providing-services-after-eu-exit">guidance on providing services after Brexit</a> if youâ€™re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with Croatia to make sure that people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">telling HMRC if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/croatia/index_en.htm">paying income tax in Croatia</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Ministry of Finance has information about custom services and declarations of goods in Croatia.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Croatia. You can find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/croatia-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyer in Croatia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance</a> while abroad in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-brexit">Money and tax after Brexit</h3>

<p>Brexit will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Croatia. Send your questions about double taxation to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.porezna-uprava.hr/en/Pages/default.aspx">relevant tax authority</a>.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in the EU.

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Croatia, you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad">UK State Pension</a> or  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension">new UK State Pension</a>. Contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre">International Pensions Centre</a> to claim</li>
  <li>your Croatian pension through your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.mirovinsko.hr/default.aspx?ID=168">social security office</a> (in Croatian)</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/retire-abroad/state-pensions-abroad/index_en.htm">pensions from working in other EU countries</a>, if you have worked in other EU countries.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances">â€˜life certificateâ€™ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you must respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you donâ€™t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-brexit">Pensions after Brexit</h3>

<p>The UK government will continue to pay a State Pension to those eligible in the EU after Brexit. Your UK State Pension will be uprated in April 2020, 2021 and 2022 if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland.</p>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Croatia, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Croatian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, the Croatian Ministry of Labour and Pensions has stated that if you have regulated your residence in Croatia before Brexit, you will continue to have Croatian pension rights after Brexit. We will update this guidance when there is a formal agreement on this.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on pensions if thereâ€™s no deal.</a></p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>You may still be able to claim some UK benefits like child and disability benefits if you live in Croatia. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">guidance on which benefits you can claim if you live abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>use our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-benefits-abroad">tool to check which benefits you can claim while youâ€™re abroad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit cannot be paid to you if youâ€™re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">request proof of the time youâ€™ve worked in the UK</a> from HMRC if you are asked for this.</p>

<h3 id="croatian-benefits">Croatian benefits</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to Croatian benefits. To find out if you are entitled to Croatian benefits and how to claim, check <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1104&langId=en">Croatian social security benefits</a>.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-after-brexit">Benefits after Brexit</h3>

<p>If there is a deal and you work and pay social security contributions in Croatia, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Croatian contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If thereâ€™s no deal, the Croatian government has proposed that those with permanent residence in Croatia will be able to continue to receive social benefits. We will update this guidance when there is a formal agreement on this.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-nationals-in-the-eu-benefits-and-pensions-in-a-no-deal-scenario">guidance on benefits and pensions in a no deal scenario</a>.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-croatia">Driving in Croatia</h2>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia, you should exchange your UK licence for a Croatian one before Brexit. You can still use your Croatian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>You should exchange your driving licence at the nearest police station. You can do this if you have either an approved temporary or permanent residence in Croatia. To exchange your licence, you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your original UK driving licence and translation</li>
  <li>payment slip</li>
  <li>administrative fee</li>
  <li>a 35 x 45 mm photograph</li>
</ul>

<p>Other documentation may be required.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Croatia, you should read the guidance on:</p>
