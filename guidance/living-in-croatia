</ul>

<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU and provides for a deal on citizensâ€™ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the EU broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Croatia</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information.</p>

<p>In the meantime, make sure you are registered as a resident in Croatia. We will update this guidance as soon as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/croatia/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Croatia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>You must register as a resident if you plan to stay in Croatia for more than 3 months. Find out from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/other/brexit/" class="govuk-link">Croatian government</a> how to register your temporary residence with the local police station and what documentation you need.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency registration processes, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport from Croatia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Croatia, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to other Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the UK and the Ireland will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-croatia">Driving in Croatia</h2>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia, you should exchange your UK licence for a Croatian one. You can still use your Croatian licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>You should exchange your driving licence at the nearest police station. You can do this if you have either an approved temporary or permanent residence in Croatia. To exchange your licence, you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your original UK driving licence and translation</li>
  <li>payment slip</li>
  <li>administrative fee</li>
  <li>a 35 x 45 mm photograph</li>
</ul>

<p>Other documentation may be required.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Croatia, you should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>

<h3 id="bringing-a-uk-registered-vehicle-to-croatia">Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Croatia</h3>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-vehicles-out-of-uk" class="govuk-link">taking a vehicle out of the UK</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the European Unionâ€™s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/index_en.htm" class="govuk-link">car registration and taxes</a> in Croatia. You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are living in Croatia or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, youâ€™ll have life-long healthcare rights in Croatia as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-croatia/" class="govuk-link">who can access healthcare in Croatia and how to register</a>.</p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Croatia and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You must apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-croatia#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia, you must not use your EHIC from the UK to access healthcare in Croatia.</p>

<p>When you travel from Croatia for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">read our travel advice pages</a> and  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>If you are a student, read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/" class="govuk-link">the NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad.</a></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-facilities-in-croatia" class="govuk-link">find English-speaking doctors in Croatia. </a></p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs" class="govuk-link">check that your prescriptions are legal in Croatia.</a></p>

<h2 id="working-in-croatia">Working in Croatia</h2>

<p>If you are registered as resident in Croatia, you have the right to work in Croatia. You can read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in an EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link">apply for a UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Croatia on or before 31 December 2020, you will maintain your right to work, as long as you remain resident in Croatia.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Croatia to make sure that you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Croatia have not changed following the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk" class="govuk-link">telling HMRC if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

</ul>

<p>The Ministry of Finance has information about custom services and declarations of goods in Croatia.</p>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Croatia. You can find an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/croatia-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">English-speaking lawyer in Croatia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">pay National Insurance</a> while abroad in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<p>If you are employed or self-employed in the EU or EEA and you have a UK-issued A1/E101 form, you will remain subject to UK legislation until the end date on the form.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>Tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad" class="govuk-link">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Croatia, you can claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad" class="govuk-link">UK State Pension</a> or  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">new UK State Pension</a>.

<h3 id="life-certificates-for-uk-state-pensions">Life certificates for UK State Pensions</h3>

<p>If you get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-if-you-retire-abroad/report-a-change-in-your-circumstances" class="govuk-link">â€˜life certificateâ€™ from the UK Pension Service</a>, you must respond as soon as possible. Your payments may be suspended if you donâ€™t.</p>

<h3 id="pensions-after-31-december-2020">Pensions after 31 December 2020</h3>

<p>There will be no changes before 31 December 2020 to the rules on claiming the UK State Pension in the EU, EEA or Switzerland as a result of the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020 you will get your UK State Pension uprated every year for as long as you continue to live there. This will happen even if you start claiming your pension on or after 1 January 2021, as long as you meet the qualifying conditions explained in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension" class="govuk-link">new State Pension guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you are living in Croatia by 31 December 2020, you will be able to count future social security contributions towards meeting the qualifying conditions for your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Croatia, you will still be able to add your UK social security contributions towards your Croatian pension. This will happen even if you claim your pension after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are considering moving to Croatia on or after 1 January 2021 and you are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, the rules depend on negotiations with the EU and may change. Check our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/benefits-and-pensions-for-uk-nationals-in-the-eea-or-switzerland" class="govuk-link">guidance on benefits and pensions in the EU</a>.</p>

<p>You can continue to receive your UK State Pension if you live in the EU, EEA or Switzerland and you can still claim your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>If you are living in the EU, EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020, you will continue to receive any UK benefits you already receive. This will continue for as long as you live there and meet all other eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>If you work and pay social security contributions in Croatia, your UK social security contributions will be taken into account when applying for Croatian contributions-based benefits. This will happen even if you claim contributions-based benefits after 31 December 2020.</p>
