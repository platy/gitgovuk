<h2>Book and plan your visit to Berwyn</h2>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<h3>Family days</h3>
<p>There are currently no family days being run.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Berwyn</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Berwyn.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms and are able to make calls at any time.</p>

<p>Phones do not accept incoming calls so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Berwyn using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You are able to attach photos for an additional charge and receive replies.</p>

<p>Emails are monitored.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Berwyn</a>.</p>

<p>All post, apart from legal letters, will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Berwyn are given a list of items that they can buy from approved suppliers through a catalogue system.</p>

<p>They can also apply to receive a clothing parcel once or twice a year depending on their length of time in prison and their behaviour level. These parcels cannot be posted in and must be handed in to staff during a visit. All items will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
