<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Everyone entering England from abroad must take one or more tests for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Depending on their vaccination status, people who’ve entered England from abroad need to take a test on either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on or before day 2 only</li>
  <li>on or before day 2 and on and after day 8</li>
</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>In this guidance, when we talk about ‘eligible’ arrivals, we mean those who are eligible to follow the rules for people who have been fully vaccinated under an approved vaccination programme.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Read an overview of the rules for travelling to England from abroad and find out who needs to take which tests</a></p>

<p>There are different rules for people who’ve been in a country on the red list during the 10 days before they arrive.</p>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" aria-label="Warning" role="note">
<p>The day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 PCR tests described in this guidance are not for arrivals from red list countries. Providers must not sell these tests to people who have been in a red list country in the 10 days before arriving in England.</p>
</div>

<p>By law, all tests privately provided for international arrivals must meet and maintain the minimum standards from 12 November 2021. 
The standards for day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing are outlined below. 
There is separate guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/day-2-lateral-flow-tests-for-international-arrivals-minimum-standards-for-providers">day 2 lateral flow tests for international arrivals: minimum standards for providers</a>.</p>

<p>People arriving from countries not on the red list who have a legal duty to self-isolate for 10 days may be able to opt in to Test to Release for international travel to see if they can shorten their quarantine period. Providers for Test to Release must meet separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/testing-to-release-for-international-travel-minimum-standards-for-testing" class="govuk-link">minimum standards</a>.</p>

<h2>Self-declaration</h2>

<p>Providers must also complete a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://support-covid-19-testing.dhsc.gov.uk/InternationalTesting">declaration</a> that their tests meet all of these standards.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>This self-declaration must only be completed by laboratories that will be conducting diagnostic test evaluation for day 2 and day 8 PCR coronavirus (COVID-19) testing for international arrivals.</p>
</div>

<p>The laboratories completing the self-declaration will self-declare on behalf of themselves and all of the organisations they’re working with to provide these tests. They will need to list all organisations that they will be working with (whether by sub-contract or otherwise) in order to carry out this service. They will also need to list any organisations they will be working with (whether by sub-contract or otherwise) to carry out genomic sequencing.</p>

<p>If there is a change to any information submitted in their self-declaration, the provider will need to notify the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) of the nature of the arrangement and the name of this organisation.</p>

<h2>Penalties and offences</h2>

<p>If a private provider does not meet the standards required, they may be committing an offence and subject to enforcement action and the resultant penalty.</p>

<h2>Problems with test kits and results</h2>

<p>Where a test kit is broken, is not delivered or gives an inconclusive or invalid test result, the provider should offer a replacement kit as soon as possible to the consumer.</p>

<h2>Minimum standards that apply to day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h2>

<h3>1. Requirement for a medical director and clinical scientist</h3>

<p>The provider of the test must have a designated resourced role that has oversight and approval of medical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting medical issues. The individual must be a registered medical practitioner ‒ registered with the General Medical Council.</p>

<p>The provider must also have a designated resourced role that has oversight of clinical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting clinical issues. The individual must be a registered clinical scientist,  registered with the Health and Care Professions Council. The same individual may fulfil both roles (medical and clinical), providing they are duly registered.</p>

<h3>2. Requirement for effective system of clinical governance</h3>

<p>The provider of the test must have an effective system of clinical governance in place, which includes appropriate standard operating procedures in relation to the carrying out of the tests being provided for mandatory day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing for international arrivals.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear governance and lines of accountability such as senior responsible officer, clinical lead, quality lead, training lead</li>
  <li>staff are appropriately trained and there is evidence of competency assessment and participation in relevant external quality assessment (<abbr title="external quality assessment">EQA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>liability and indemnity cover for staff</li>
  <li>for laboratory testing, a verification report for the laboratory element of the test (known as the assay), in line with national protocols (for laboratory-based testing)</li>
  <li>information management systems to monitor sample delivery and tracking</li>
  <li>systems to meet the provisions for handling, transportation and analysis of test samples</li>
  <li>for laboratory testing, working to containment level CL3 or CL2+ with Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) approval</li>
  <li>systems, processes and record management to support the delivery of safe and reliable service</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. The test device must be permitted to be put into service in accordance with part 4 of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, other than solely by virtue of regulation 39(2) of those regulations.</h3>

<p>This requirement is to ensure that the testing device has a CE marking (or, following the UK’s exit from the European Union, a UK marking) and do not benefit from a derogation from those standards.</p>

<p>A CE mark is a logo that is placed on in vitro diagnostic (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic">IVD</abbr>) medical device to show that it conforms to the requirements of the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC. A CE mark shows that the testing device is fit for its intended purpose stated and meets legislative requirements relating to safety.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, a test with a UKCA mark can be used. Tests with a CE mark can be used until 30 June  2023.</p>

<p>Further information is available on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking" class="govuk-link">CE marking</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>4. Reporting of coronavirus test results, as a notifiable disease</h3>

<p>The provider must have a system in place for reporting positive, negative and inconclusive test results cases in accordance with their obligations under public health legislation. All results of tests for this purpose must be reported within 48 hours of the test being received by the lab for processing.</p>

<p>More information is available in the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926838/PHE_Laboratory_reporting_guidelines_October-2020-v3.pdf">guidance on the reporting of notifiable diseases</a>.</p>

<p>At booking, the provider (or sub-contractor, if relevant) must have a system in place to collect the following data fields from international arrivals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>NHS number (if known and applicable)</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>home address, including postcode, and the address at which they intend to reside in England (if different)</li>
  <li>email address (only needed for positive and inconclusive results)</li>
  <li>telephone number (only needed for positive and inconclusive results)</li>
  <li>COVID-19 vaccination status</li>
</ul>

<p>Together with data required to be reported under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/659/contents" rel="external" class="govuk-link">The Health Protection Regulations 2010</a>, the provider (or their subcontractor, if relevant) will need to have a system in place to collect from the international arrival and report the following additional data fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date of their arrival in the UK</li>
  <li>their coach number, flight number or vessel name (as appropriate)</li>
  <li>the date on which they last departed from or transited through a country or territory outside the common travel area</li>
  <li>the country or territory they were travelling from when they arrived in the UK, and any country or territory they transited through as part of that journey</li>
  <li>the date they took the test</li>
  <li>the sample specimen ID number prefixed by the laboratory ID</li>
  <li>COVID-19 vaccination status</li>
  <li>the purpose of the test – this must include the vaccination status of the person taking the test (whether they’re eligible for fully vaccinated rules or not), and whether they’ve been in a red list country in the 10 days before arriving in England</li>
  <li>test booking reference</li>
  <li>passport number or travel document reference number</li>
</ul>

<p>The following additional data must also be reported by the laboratory conducting genome sequencing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name and address of the diagnostic laboratory</li>
  <li>the date and time the sample was received by the diagnostic laboratory</li>
  <li>where a causative agent is identified, the details of that agent</li>
  <li>where the test is for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus, the result of the test</li>
  <li>date of the sample</li>
  <li>nature of the sample</li>
  <li>the results of any antimicrobial susceptibility test and any resistance mechanism identified in respect of the sample</li>
</ul>

<p>The following information about the sample:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any laboratory comments</li>
  <li>the organism code</li>
  <li>the specimen number (including the laboratory’s five-letter unique identifier code)</li>
  <li>the specimen type</li>
  <li>the specimen date</li>
  <li>the test method applied</li>
  <li>cycle threshold values</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the diagnostic laboratory is not the sequencing laboratory:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name and address of the sequencing laboratory</li>
  <li>the date and time that the specimen was received by the sequencing laboratory</li>
  <li>a report of the results of the sequencing</li>
  <li>the date of that report</li>
  <li>a sorted BAM file containing all reads aligning to the SARS-Cov-2 reference genome with unaligned human reads removed</li>
  <li>any metadata required to reproduce the analysis which produced the results of the sequencing</li>
</ul>

<p>The following information about the specimen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any laboratory comments</li>
  <li>the organism code</li>
  <li>the specimen number</li>
  <li>the specimen type</li>
  <li>the specimen date</li>
  <li>the test method applied</li>
  <li>cycle threshold values</li>
  <li>whether the specimen is a variant of concern or a variant under investigation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitions of VOCs and VUIs can be found in the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://github.com/phe-genomics/variant_definitions">variant guidance</a>.</p>

<p>All data reporting to the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) for day 2 and 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing for international arrivals must be conducted by the diagnostic laboratory, or sequencing laboratory where appropriate.</p>

<h3>5. Reporting test sales</h3>

<p>The provider must complete a daily report that details your total sales to travellers arriving into England on the day of report completion. Providers must report whether tests sold are for eligible or non-eligible arrivals from countries not on the red list. Test providers must also provide the test booking references for all sales completed on that day.</p>

<p>This will need to be filled in by each customer facing provider that is selling tests directly to international arrivals. If a laboratory is selling tests directly to the public, they need to meet the same sales reporting requirements as outlined above.</p>

<p>These reports will be required daily through a live form provided to testing providers who meet minimum standards.</p>

<p>This information will not be used for any commercial purposes.</p>

<h3>6. Relevant systems in place to report adverse test incidents</h3>

<p>The provider must be able to demonstrate that it has systems in place to identify any adverse incidents or quality control issues in respect of the test device and be able to report them in a timely manner to the relevant regulatory body. Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) has a dedicated coronavirus (COVID-19) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/coronavirus-covid-19-new-dedicated-yellow-card-reporting-site-for-medicines-and-medical-devices">yellow card portal</a> to report adverse incidents with medicines, medical devices and diagnostics.</p>

<h3>7. Use of age-appropriate test devices</h3>

<p>The test device should be age-appropriate, so it should be suitable to administer or provide a test to a person of the same age as the international arrival.</p>

<h3>8. Sales of tests</h3>

<p>Genome sequencing must be included within the cost of any product that contains day 2 or day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing.</p>

<h3>9. Reference number format</h3>

<p>At the time the test package is booked, the test provider must provide a single test reference number to the person booking the test. If the provider sells multiple test packages to one person, each test package will require its own booking reference.</p>

<p>The booking reference must be in the required format which the provider must give to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> when they onboard.</p>

<p>At the time of reporting test results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, the laboratory must prefix their specimen number with the laboratory ID. Where laboratories go on to sequence the sample, they must use the same laboratory ID and specimen number as previously used to report the diagnostic test result, even if these 2 processes are performed by 2 separate laboratories.</p>

<h3>10. Issuance of booking reference</h3>

<p>Providers must only issue a booking reference to a customer once payment has been taken.</p>

<h3>11. Sub-contractors or organisations you are working with</h3>

<p>If the test provider arranges with another provider or person (for example a sub-contractor) to carry out any element of the single end-to-end testing service on their behalf, the test provider must ensure that such person complies with the necessary requirements as relevant to the carrying out of that element of the service. This must result in the full end-to-end process meeting all of the relevant minimum standards.</p>

<h3>12. Notification of test result: providers must issue the result of tests in a set notification which instructs the international arrival on whether they are required to quarantine</h3>

<h4>Form A: negative test result</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your coronavirus (COVID-19) test result is negative. You did not have the virus when the test was done.</p>

<p>You are not required to quarantine or take a day 8 test if you are travelling from a country not on the red list and meet the requirements of being an ‘eligible’ traveller.</p>

<p>If you are travelling from a country not on the red list and are not an ‘eligible’ traveller, if you took the test on or before day 2 of your quarantine period, you must continue to quarantine until you have completed the 10-day quarantine period and received a negative result for a test taken on day 8. If you took the test on day 8, you may stop quarantining when you have completed your 10-day quarantine period.</p>

<p>You should self-isolate again if you get symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">Get an NHS coronavirus (COVID-19) test</a> and self-isolate until you get the results.</p>

<p>See advice about <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/">self-isolation and treating symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> on the NHS website.</p>
</div>

<h4>Form B: positive test result</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your coronavirus test result is positive. You had the virus when the test was done.</p>

<p>If you received a positive test result for the test taken you do not need to take any further tests.</p>

<p>You may be contacted for contact tracing and to check that you, and those who you live or are travelling with, are self-isolating.</p>

<p>You must not travel, including to leave the UK, during self-isolation.</p>

<p>Contact 111 if you need medical help. In an emergency dial 999.</p>
</div>

<h4>Form C: unclear test result</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your coronavirus test result is unclear. It is not possible to say if you had the virus when the test was done.</p>

<p>You must take another test or self-isolate for 10 days from the day after your test date.</p>

<p>You may be contacted to check that you are self-isolating.</p>
</div>

<h3>13. Compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements, for sample collection, processing and sharing of results including the requirements of data protection legislation</h3>

<p>The Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>) has set out FAQs on data collection and data protection relating to coronavirus (COVID-19) that provide further information, including <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> considerations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers-and-third-party-healthcare-providers" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing: guidance for employers and third-party healthcare providers</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/global/data-protection-and-coronavirus-information-hub/coronavirus-recovery-data-protection-advice-for-organisations/testing/" rel="external"><abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr> FAQs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is for the provider to satisfy themselves, taking legal advice as necessary, that they have met all the relevant legal and regulatory requirements relating to data protection. However, they will want to take full account of the fact that the processing of an individual’s health data is subject to additional levels of protection by Article 9 of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and can only be disclosed where it is necessary and proportionate for one of the specific purposes set out in that Article.</p>

<p>The provider is also reminded that they run a risk of breaching Article 5 of the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and the Data Protection Act 2018 and being subject to significant regulatory penalties if, having obtained health data from an individual under these standards, they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>retain that data for longer than is necessary in order to fulfil their role as a test provider operating in accordance with these standards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>process that data for a purpose that would be incompatible with the purpose for which the data was initially collected. Further processing the data for their own commercial or research objectives are examples of an incompatible purpose in these circumstances</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>14. Test kit delivery and administration</h3>

<p>Day 2 test kits must be delivered (or administered, where the provider is supplying a swabbing service) on or before day 2 of the traveller’s quarantine period. If a day 8 self-swab test kit is also required, it may be sent out together with the day 2 test. However, the tests must be administered on or after day 8, including where swabbed by a test provider.</p>

<h3>15. Turnaround time</h3>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> laboratories should report all <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and the individual within 48 hours of the test being received by the diagnostic laboratory.</p>

<h3>16. Provider accreditation requirements</h3>

<p>These are only required for organisations providing sample collection and/or laboratory-based <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing services. This requirement does not prevent issue of tests which are self-swabbed or self-administered since those samples would be taken under instruction from the person responsible for taking the samples.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Providers must be or use a United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>) accredited or applicant laboratory to ISO 15189 or ISO/IEC 17025 (Medical Laboratories – requirements for quality and competence) for the performance of molecular methods.</li>
  <li>Providers must be or use a <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited or applicant laboratory to ISO 15189 or ISO/IEC 17025 for genome sequencing.</li>
  <li>Additionally, samples must be taken by a provider (or sub-contractor, if relevant) who is <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited or an applicant to ISO standard ISO15189 or ISO/IEC 17025. This requirement does not prevent issue of tests which are self-swabbed or self-administered since those samples would be taken under instruction from the person responsible for taking the samples.</li>
</ol>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of laboratories. This accreditation is an important element in establishing and maintaining confidence in a testing service.</p>

<p>For polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) or other lab-based testing, all samples must be processed by a <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited or applicant laboratory (the laboratory is accredited or has applied for <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation but has not yet achieved it) and have quality management systems operating according to ISO 15189 or ISO/IEC 17025. Samples must also be taken by or under the written instruction of, a provider (and their sub-contractors, if relevant) that is applicant to ISO 15189 or ISO/IEC 17025. This requirement does not prevent issue of tests which are self-swabbed or self-administered since those samples would be taken under written instruction from the person responsible for taking the samples.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> appraisal status (‘stage 2’) became mandatory for commercial providers coronavirus  (COVID-19) testing 4 weeks after they become a <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> applicant and have self-declared on the GOV.UK website confirming they meet minimum requirements. <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> appraisal status is an assessment of compliance with the minimum requirements published by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> for fulfilment of stage 2.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation (‘stage 3’), which is full accreditation to the relevant ISO standard, requires the provider to receive a positive recommendation from <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> within 4 months of completing stage 2 (the date the organisation submitted evidence to <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> showing compliance with the <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> appraisal requirements) and achieve full accreditation within 6 months after completing stage 2 <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> appraisal.</p>

<h3>17. Use of tests that meet minimum performance characteristics for day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h3>

<p>The provider must use established molecular detection methods that have been independently validated by a laboratory with a <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited SARS-COV-2 RT-<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> method, or an ISO15189 or ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory with the following performance characteristics as a minimum:</p>

<p>For day 2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clinical sensitivity greater than or equal to 99% (or a 95% 2-sided confidence interval entirely above 97%)</li>
  <li>clinical specificity greater than or equal to 99% (or a 95% 2-sided confidence interval entirely above 97%)</li>
  <li>limit of detection less than or equal to 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 copies per millilitre (≤1,000 Copies/ml)</li>
</ul>

<p>For day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sensitivity greater than or equal to 95% (or a 95% 2-sided confidence interval entirely above 90%)</li>
  <li>specificity greater than or equal to 97% (or a 95% 2-sided confidence interval entirely above 95%)</li>
  <li>limit of detection less or equal to 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 copies per millilitre (≤1,000 copies/ml  )</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, the assay must have been independently validated as having the required sensitivity and specificity using at least 150 positive clinical samples and 250 negative clinical samples against a laboratory-based RT-<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test that is itself within the performance specification of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> TPP for laboratory based SARS-COV-2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. The viral load of the 150 positive samples should span the dynamic range of the assay in equal proportions (high, medium and low CT values).</p>

<p>Independent validation must have been conducted, no more than 18 months before the test is provided, by one of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an independent laboratory which is accredited by <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> to ISO 15189 or ISO/IEC 17025 for detection of SARS-Cov-2 virus RNA (an ‘independent laboratory’ is one that is independent of both the test manufacturer and the laboratory for which the validation is being conducted - meaning the laboratory that will be sending this validation to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> through the self-declaration process)</li>
  <li>a scientific committee which is overseen by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, including the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-and-procurement-of-coronavirus-covid-19-tests/coronavirus-covid-19-serology-and-viral-detection-testing-uk-procurement-overview" class="govuk-link">Technologies Validation Group</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work/target-product-profile-antibody-tests-to-help-determine-if-people-have-recent-infection-to-sars-cov-2-version-2">Further guidance explaining how both virus and antibody tests work has been published by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>18. Use of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests that are suitable for identification of SARS-COV-2 variants</h3>

<h4>The assay must be semi quantitative and include a minimum of 2 distinguishable SARS-COV-2 gene targets not including S gene or performance reference controls.</h4>

<p>The assay should amplify more than 1 gene target in distinct regions and each gene target must be identifiable as a separate CT value or equivalent.</p>

<h4>Must include routine in silico assurance against variants of concern.</h4>

<p>The supplier should perform a minimum biweekly check of the amplification region and primer probes against new variants of concern reported by GISAID or <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and report (within 48 hours) new variants that impact on the amplification target region, including primers, probs and amplicon.</p>

<h4>The test solution must provide extracted nucleic acid that is suitable for whole genome sequencing using a specified method.</h4>

<h3>19. Targeted sequencing methods</h3>

<p>Sequencing shall be performed using a targeted sequencing method specific to SARS-CoV-2 or equivalent amplicon or sequence bait capture methods.</p>

<p>An amplicon is defined as an amplified product of a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> reaction.</p>

<p>Sequence bait capture is a method for enriching a sample for a target of interest before sequencing using long single stranded nucleotide sequence ‘baits’ that bind to complementary sequence in the target.</p>

<h3>20. Data provision to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> confirming variant sequencing capability</h3>

<p>The provider should ensure test manufacturers are providing data to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> demonstrating the suitability of the device for identifying SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern.</p>

<h3>21. Sequencing of samples with a &lt;30 CT value</h3>

<p>All samples with cycle threshold (CT) values of &lt;30 (defined as equivalent to ~10,000-1,000 viral genome copies/ml) must be sequenced.</p>

<h3>22. Coverage of genome sequencing</h3>

<p>The percentage of target bases which should have been sequenced for a given number of times is set out below, as the coverage breadth:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All SARS-CoV-2 genomes must have minimal sequencing coverage of 50% at &gt;= 30x coverage.</li>
  <li>For samples with a CT &lt;20, defined as viral genome copy number equivalent of &lt;1,000,000 viral genome copies per ml, 95% of samples should have a reference genome coverage breadth of &gt;97% at &gt;=30x coverage.</li>
  <li>For CT above 20, defined as viral genome copy number equivalent of &gt;1,000 per ml, 95% of samples should have a reference genome coverage breadth of &gt;75% at &gt;=30x coverage.</li>
</ol>

<h3>23. Upload of data files</h3>

<p>Sequencing laboratories must send all files containing reads aligning to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (with unaligned and human reads removed).</p>

<h3>24. Preservation and transport of test material</h3>

<p>Provider must preserve and transport test material to support sequencing.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Preferred</h4>

<p>Transfer of the original extract used for the PCR should be frozen at -20°C.</p>

<p>The provider should maintain and evidence the storage conditions, including temperature logging.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Acceptable</h4>

<p>Transport of sample from collection point to test site at 4°C using standard cold box systems in virus transport medium (VTM) within 6 hours.</p>

<p>Use a standard flock or sponge swab designed for PCR.</p>

<p>Purpose designed and validated swab and VTM kits should be used by test providers.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-guidance-for-clinical-diagnostic-laboratories">More information is available</a>.</p>

<p>The courier should maintain and evidence the storage conditions, including temperature logging.</p>
</div>

<h3>25. Removal of human reads</h3>

<p>Provider must have a process in place to remove human reads from any data submitted to a public repository.</p>

<h3>26. Availability of samples for dual sequencing</h3>

<p>The provider must make samples available for dual sequencing on the request of NHS Test and Trace or the COVID-19 UK Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) and partake in assurance processes on request.</p>

<h3>27. Turnaround time</h3>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> laboratories should report all <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and the individual within 48 hours of the test being received by the diagnostic laboratory.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> laboratories who do not have their own genomic sequencing capability, they are required to transfer the positive sample to their sequencing laboratory within 24 hours of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result being called.</p>

<p>All sequencing laboratories should report all genomic sequencing results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> within 120 hours of the original positive result being called. They should report all files containing all reads aligning to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome with unaligned and human reads removed, to be sent to UKSHA within 120 hours of the original positive result being called, along with sufficient metadata to permit reproduction of the analysis that produced the results.</p>

<h3>28. Requirement for a bioinformatician</h3>

<p>The provider should have a bioinformatician supervising genome sequencing. The same individual that fulfils the medical director and/or clinical oversight roles may also fulfil this role.</p>
