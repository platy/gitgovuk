<h2 id="hmcts-response-to-coronavirus-outbreak">HMCTS response to coronavirus outbreak</h2>

<p>During this unprecedented public health emergency, we’re working hard to keep our justice system working. This has meant introducing new practices and procedures to make sure our buildings are safe and to minimise risks to the judiciary, staff and all those who attend our courts and tribunals for hearings.</p>

<h2 id="working-towards-recovery">Working towards recovery</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/court-and-tribunal-recovery-update-in-response-to-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">our recovery update</a> we have published details setting out the work being undertaken by HMCTS in the short and medium terms in response to coronavirus (COVID-19). Our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmcts-vulnerability-action-plan" class="govuk-link">vulnerability action plan</a> outlines the way courts and tribunals have changed the way they work to run safely during COVID-19 and enable vulnerable people to access the justice system</p>

<p>Each week we publish an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hmcts-weekly-operational-summary-on-courts-and-tribunals-during-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">operational summary on courts and tribunals during the coronavirus outbreak</a> to provide latest information about what is happening across HMCTS.</p>

<h2 id="coming-to-court-or-tribunal-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Coming to court or tribunal during the coronavirus outbreak</h2>

<p>Courts and tribunals are open for face to face hearings, making sure that judges, legal professionals, staff and all those attending hearings can maintain effective social distancing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-levels-what-you-need-to-know" class="govuk-link">Local COVID Alert Levels</a> and local restrictions allow people to travel for work when necessary. This includes all those required to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/going-to-a-court-or-tribunal-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">attend a court or tribunal</a>, including jurors, witnesses, defendants, complainants and victims. All our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/keeping-court-and-tribunal-buildings-safe-secure-and-clean" class="govuk-link">buildings are COVID-secure</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You should not come to any of our court and tribunal buildings if you have coronavirus symptoms, if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or if you have been instructed by the NHS to self-isolate. Please <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-court-tribunal" class="govuk-link">contact the court or tribunal</a> before you are due to attend so that suitable arrangements can be made for your hearing. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/going-to-a-court-or-tribunal-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">Read our guidance about coming to court during the pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>While <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1045/regulation/2/made" class="govuk-link">public health legislation</a> allows those involved in legal proceedings to come out of self-isolation when necessary, you must consult with the court or tribunal first who will consider and decide on appropriate arrangements.</p>
</div>

<p>Read the latest <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/" class="govuk-link">NHS information about Coronavirus (COVID19)</a>.</p>

<p>We have increased use of telephone, video and other technology to hold many hearings remotely. We make best possible use of the equipment available and are updating and adding to that. Some hearings, the most obvious being jury trials, cannot be conducted remotely, but take place in COVID secure buildings.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hmcts-telephone-and-video-hearings-during-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">guidance on how HMCTS will use telephone and video technology during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak</a>.</p>

<p>Your hearing notice will inform you whether it is taking place in person, via video (CVP) or telephone. If you are self-isolating and unable to attend in person, please contact the court or tribunal immediately so alternative arrangements can be considered.</p>

<p>If you are asked to attend court or tribunal to participate in legal proceedings – such as providing evidence as a witness or a defendant – then this counts as an essential reason for travel.  Have your hearing letter with you if you need to provide that proof your journey is essential.  Remember to bring any other papers you need for your hearing with you too.</p>

<p>Media and members of the public will be also able to attend court hearings in person if safe to do so, unless <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-advice/" class="govuk-link">self-isolating based on government and NHS advice</a>, or have heard from us.</p>

<h2 id="getting-advice">Getting advice</h2>

<p>We have a range of guidance available to help our users when coming to a court or tribunal:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="assessing-and-managing-coronavirus-risk">Assessing and managing coronavirus risk</h2>

<p>We have comprehensively assessed risk to staff and users and are ensuring the safety of anyone who comes in to our buildings by applying published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/keeping-court-and-tribunal-buildings-safe-secure-and-clean" class="govuk-link">court and tribunal coronavirus safety controls</a>. These have been endorsed by Public Health England and Public Health Wales.</p>

<p>A process for checking compliance at each site is in place, with controls reviewed and monitored at each court and tribunal building. We encourage all court users to raise any issues you experience within our buildings with local managers.</p>

<p>We will continue to carefully consider whether additional or different guidance or controls are required to manage the change in any risks.</p>

<p>Risks within general office locations, where social distancing and other safety measures are in place, will continue to be assessed and in line with government guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/offices-and-contact-centres" class="govuk-link">‘working safely in offices and contact centres’</a>. An assessment tool provides court and tribunal colleagues with approved standards to assess individual building safety for all users.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Our organisational risk assessment enables us to review our buildings safety regularly - allowing us to identify, mitigate and take action wherever necessary.</p>

<p>These indicators will guide local assessments of all our buildings. It will help us to identify and act quickly on any areas of concern. And if we cannot resolve any major issues swiftly, we will temporarily close the building until we are satisfied that it is safe to re-open.</p>
</div>

<p>Staff in courts and tribunal buildings are working hard to ensure the safety of those who use them. Decisions about the use of specific properties for particular types of hearings, such as criminal jury trials and Nightingale courts, will be made according to agreed procedures.</p>

At that stage, if following <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/what-to-do-if-you-or-someone-you-live-with-has-coronavirus-symptoms/" class="govuk-link">government advice you need to self-isolate</a>, you will not be expected to start your jury service. You will need to <a rel="external" href="https://courttribunalfinder.service.gov.uk/search/" class="govuk-link">contact the court</a> to let us know if  there’s another reason why you cannot attend. If you are not needed for jury service, the court will let you know.</p>
