<h2>Book and plan your visit to Bure</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>HMP Bure is offering visits for family and friends. Visiting times and availability may change at short notice. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact the prison direct for any queries</a>.</p>

<p>Now that regular COVID testing of people in the wider community has ended, you are no longer required to take a COVID test before coming to see someone for a visit, although we would still encourage you to do so.</p>

<p>We will continue to run social visits whilst it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>Visiting rules may change if there is an outbreak within the prison, this may include bringing back testing before visits for a short time to protect you, the person you are visiting and staff.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">keep in touch</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>

<h3>Entering Bure</h3>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID when visiting a prison</a>.</p>
<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children.</p>

<p>Bure has a strict dress code policy, which means visitors should dress appropriately (no vests, no low-cut tops, no shorts, no short dresses and no headwear, other than that worn for religious reasons).</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into Bure. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. This includes pushchairs and car seats.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<p>There is a friendly and welcoming visitors centre, run by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spurgeons.org/find-your-local-service/her-majestys-prison-and-probation-service/" rel="external">Spurgeons</a>.

<h3>Children’s visits</h3>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Bure</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Bure.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always need to call you rather than you call them.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named and approved on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>Prisoners can call you as many times a day as they like (depending on their phone credit), but each call is limited to 15 minutes. They also have to wait 15 minutes to call again. They can call throughout the day until 6:45pm in the week and 5pm on weekends.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Bure using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos, depending on the rules at Bure.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>Include the person’s name and prisoner number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prisoner number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Bure</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>
<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>
<p>People in Bure can only have books and clothing sent in. Clothing can only be sent during the last 6 months of a prisoner’s sentence. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Bure</a> for more information on what’s allowed.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the person’s name and prisoner number on the parcel.</p>

<p>All parcels will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<p>Prisoners can buy a variety of items for themselves through a catalogue system.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
