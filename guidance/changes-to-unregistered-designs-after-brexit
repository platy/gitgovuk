<p>Get ready for Brexit on 31 October. This page tells you how to prepare and it will be updated if anything changes, including if a deal is agreed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup?topic=%2Fbrexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>
</div>

<p>After Brexit, unregistered Community designs (<abbr title="Unregistered Community Designs">UCDs</abbr>), will no longer be valid in the UK.</p>

<p>On exit day, these rights will be immediately and automatically replaced by UK rights.</p>

<p>If you own an existing right, you do not need to do anything at this stage.</p>

<h2 id="continuing-unregistered-design">Continuing unregistered design</h2>

<p>Designs that are protected in the UK as an unregistered Community design before exit day will be protected as a UK continuing unregistered design and will be automatically established on exit day.</p>

<p>It will continue to be protected in the UK for the remainder of the 3 year term attached to it.</p>

<p>The fact that a corresponding unregistered Community design was established before exit day through first disclosure in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> but outside of the UK will not affect the validity of the continuing unregistered design.</p>

<h2 id="supplementary-unregistered-design">Supplementary unregistered design</h2>

<p>You should carefully consider how, when and where you first disclose your designs in order to establish unregistered protection in the UK and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Under the new law, we are creating a UK unregistered design right called Supplementary unregistered design (<abbr title="Supplementary Unregistered Design">SUD</abbr>).</p>

<p>This right will ensure that the full range of design protection provided in the UK before exit day will remain available after we leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The terms of supplementary unregistered design protection will be similar to that already conferred by unregistered community design. However, the protection it provides will not extend to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Supplementary unregistered design will mirror the <abbr title="Unregistered Community Design">UCD</abbr> by providing post-exit UK protection for both 3-and 2-dimensional designs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Supplementary Unregistered Design">SUD</abbr> will be established by first disclosure in the UK or another qualifying country. It will be subject to interpretation by the UK Courts.</p>

<p>First disclosure in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will not establish <abbr title="Supplementary Unregistered Design">SUD</abbr>. However, it may destroy the novelty in that design, should you later seek to claim UK unregistered rights.</p>

<h2 id="exhaustion-of-intellectual-property-rights">Exhaustion of intellectual property rights</h2>

<p>Intellectual property rights give a right holder certain exclusive rights. These include the right to control distribution of the product.</p>

<p>The exhaustion of intellectual property rights refers to the loss of the right to control distribution and resale of a product after it has been legitimately put on the market in a specific territory, currently the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Exhaustion of intellectual property rights is covered by a separate statutory instrument that has been approved by Parliament. See <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2018/9780111175255/contents">The Intellectual Property (Exhaustion of Rights) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p>Provisions relating to the exhaustion of supplementary and continuing unregistered design are included in this statutory instrument.</p>

<p>These provisions are consistent with those contained in the Exhaustion statutory instrument. They maintain the existing approach by setting out that the question of whether a product has been lawfully placed into free circulation will be assessed in relation to the same geographical area, that is the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and the UK.</p>

<h2 id="uk-design-right">UK design right</h2>

<p>UK design right will continue after exit day and will function alongside continuing and supplementary unregistered design.</p>

<p>It will continue to provide protection for the shape and configuration of 3-dimensional articles for up to 15 years from the end of the year in which the design was first recorded or a corresponding article was first made.</p>

<p>Current law states that a UK design right can be established in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by an individual who is resident in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>by a business formed under the laws of an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state</li>
  <li>where first disclosure of the design occurs in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that activity inside of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> but outside the UK can be sufficient for establishing UK design right.</p>

<p>The qualifying criteria for UK design right will change on exit day. This will create consistency with the new supplementary unregistered design, and avoid an imbalance between UK and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> designers.</p>

<p>Qualification for the right will be limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people resident in the UK or a qualifying country</li>
  <li>businesses formed under the laws of the UK or a qualifying country</li>
</ul>

<p>Where qualification is a result of first marketing, you will need to have disclosed your design in the UK or a qualifying country.</p>
