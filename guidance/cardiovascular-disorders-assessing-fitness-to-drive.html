<h4>New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart failure</h4>

<p>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is used to grade the severity of functional limitations in a patient with heart failure (1):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>class I no limitation of physical activity –</strong> ordinary physical activity does not cause fatigue, breathlessness or palpitation (includes asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction)
<br><br>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>class II slight limitation of physical activity –</strong> patients are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, breathlessness or angina pectoris (symptomatically ‘mild’ heart failure)
<br><br>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>class III marked limitation of physical activity –</strong> although patients are comfortable at rest, less than ordinary activity will lead to symptoms (symptomatically ‘moderate’ heart failure)
<br><br>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>class IV inability to carry out any physical activity without discomfort –</strong> symptoms of congestive cardiac failure are present even at rest. Increased discomfort with any physical activity (symptomatically ‘severe’ heart failure)</li>
</ul>

              <p class="app-c-published-dates__change-note">As a consequence of both panel review and upcoming changes to European legislation, several changes have been made to this chapter. There are entirely new sections on: Long QT syndrome; Brugada syndrome; and a completely rewritten section on cardiac failure.
Several standards relating to a range of cardiac and related conditions have been clarified and/or supplemented to take account of changes in medical and related therapies. These include: implantable cardioverter defibrillators; aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection; high blood pressure (hypertension); cardiomyopathies; aortic stenosis; and congenital heart disease.</p>
