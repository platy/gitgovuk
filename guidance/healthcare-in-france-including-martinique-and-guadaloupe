<p>This information is about living in France. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting France.</a></p>
</div>

<p>You must have health insurance cover to live in France.</p>

<p>State healthcare in France is not free. Healthcare costs are covered by both the state and through patient contributions. These are known as co-payments.</p>

<p>You may have to pay upfront for some treatment. The French national insurance fund, Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie (CPAM), will then repay you for part of the costs later.</p>

<p>At the moment, UK nationals usually access the French healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making French social security contributions through their employer or as a self-employed person</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued S1 certificate with the local CPAM office</li>
</ul>

<p>The S1 certificate entitles UK nationals access to state healthcare on the same basis as a French citizen. You’re entitled to an S1 if you receive a UK State Pension or certain other benefits. <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">Find out more about the S1.</a></p>

<h2 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period">Healthcare during the transition period</h2>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals visiting or living in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC during this time, as you did before.</p>

<p>If you’re living in France or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in France as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency. This guidance explains what you need to do in France depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-if-you-live-and-work-in-france">Healthcare if you live and work in France</h2>
<p>You can apply to be covered by the French healthcare system (‘PUMa’) if you have been a resident in France for at least 3 months. If you’re employed in France, you can apply as soon as you start work. You’ll have access to state healthcare on the same basis as a French citizen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-france" class="govuk-link">Find out more about becoming resident in France</a>.</p>

<p>You will pay for PUMa through social security contributions if you are employed or self-employed in France.</p>

<p>If you are not employed you may have to pay into PUMa yourself. There is more information on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure/droits-demarches/etudes-emploi-retraite/sans-emploi/sans-emploi" class="govuk-link">CPAM website</a> (in French).</p>

<h3 id="how-to-register">How to register</h3>
<p>You can apply for PUMa through your local CPAM office. <a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/english-pages" class="govuk-link">There is information about how to register online</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll get a French social security number and once registered, you’ll get a social security card, called a ‘Carte Vitale’. Take it with you whenever you visit a doctor, pharmacy or specialist provider.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-youll-pay">How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>State healthcare in France is not free. You may have to pay some of the cost of any treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you understand what you’ll be charged and how much of that you will get back through insurance. <a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/remboursements" class="govuk-link">There is information (in French) about reimbursements online</a>.</p>

<p>You can also get top-up insurance called a ‘mutuelle’. This will cover all or part of your medical costs.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-you-live-and-work-in-france">Healthcare during the transition period if you live and work in France</h3>
<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>If you’re living in France or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in France as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>This means you’ll also have the right to apply for a <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="posted-worker">If your UK employer has sent you to France temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad/posted-workers" class="govuk-link">posted worker</a> is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to another European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>Currently, posted workers can use an EHIC or an S1 certificate to access French healthcare.
HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<p>You should register your S1 with CPAM.</p>

<p>You may also need a UK-issued A1 certificate to show that you pay national insurance in the UK. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-insurance-application-for-form-e101-if-self-employed-in-european-economic-area-ca3837" class="govuk-link">get this from HMRC</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re using an EHIC, you’ll need to show the card when you go to your appointment.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-youre-a-posted-worker">Healthcare during the transition period if you’re a posted worker</h3>
<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC or S1 during this time, as you did before.</p>

<h2 id="s1">UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 in France</h2>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in France and receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 if you’re a <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">posted worker</a> or frontier worker. You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>Once you have an S1 certificate, you must register it at your local CPAM office.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a French citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll still have to pay part of your medical costs, just like other French residents.</p>

<p>You can also get top-up insurance called a ‘mutuelle’. This will cover all or part of your medical costs that are not covered by state repayments.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-an-s1">How to get an S1</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-an-s1-in-france">How to use an S1 in France</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 with your local CPAM office. <a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/english-pages" class="govuk-link">There is information about how to register online</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll get a French social security number and once registered, you’ll get a social security card, called a ‘Carte Vitale’. Take it with you whenever you visit a doctor, pharmacy or specialist provider.</p>

<p>This will mean you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as French citizen.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-you-use-an-s1">Healthcare during the transition period if you use an S1</h3>

<p>There is different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK S1 holders in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020 if you’re either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone with an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>someone with another ‘exportable benefit’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re living in France or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in France as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>This means that you’ll get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continued access to healthcare in France using your UK-issued S1</li>
  <li>a UK-issued EHIC for travelling to other countries in the EU</li>
  <li>planned treatments in other EU countries via the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">S2 route</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="moving-back-to-the-uk">Moving back to the UK</h2>
<p>If you return to the UK permanently you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-nhs-when-you-return-to-live-in-the-uk" class="govuk-link">using the NHS when you return to live in the UK</a>.</p>

<h2 id="studying-in-france">Studying in France</h2>
<p>You can apply for a <a rel="external" href="https://www.ameli.fr/assure/english-pages" class="govuk-link">student EHIC</a>. This is different from a normal EHIC, and entitles you to cover for longer.</p>

<p>Your student EHIC should be valid until at least the end of the academic year.</p>

<p>Your EHIC gives you access to emergency or necessary state healthcare for the same cost as a French resident.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for health insurance. You should also have insurance to cover the duration of your course.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-youre-studying-in-france">Healthcare during the transition period if you’re studying in France</h3>
<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC during this time, as you did before.</p>

<p>If you started studying in France before the end of 2020, your student EHIC will be valid for the rest of the time you study there.</p>
