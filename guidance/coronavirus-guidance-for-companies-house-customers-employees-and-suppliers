<p>We have reduced numbers in our offices to maintain social distancing, and many of our employees are affected by local restrictions.</p>

<p>It’s taking much longer than usual to process paper documents, forms and letters sent to us by post. You should use our online services to make sure your information is processed on time.</p>

<p id="file-online">You can:</p>

<p>It also includes features such as acknowledgments and online payment using GOV.UK Pay. We’re continually working to improve this service and include more document types.</p>

<h2 id="more-time-to-file-accounts-and-other-information">More time to file accounts and other information</h2>
<p>On 25 June 2020, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/corporate-insolvency-and-governance-bill-receives-royal-assent" class="govuk-link">the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 received royal assent</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the measures in the Act came into effect immediately on Friday 26 June 2020. Other measures came into effect on Saturday 27 June 2020 when the secondary legislation came into force.</p>

<p>The measures introduced by the Act will relieve the burden on businesses during the coronavirus outbreak and allow them to focus all their efforts on continuing to operate.</p>

<p>Companies and other types of business registered at Companies House will get more time to file accounts and other information. We are in the process of updating all deadlines on <a rel="external" href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Companies House service</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll update your filing deadline automatically. You do not need to apply for an extension.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-companies-etc-filing-requirements-temporary-modifications-regulations-2020" class="govuk-link">guidance on the temporary changes to Companies House filing requirements</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="changes-to-strike-off-policy-and-late-filing-penalties">Changes to strike-off policy and late filing penalties</h2>

<p>We understand that this is a difficult time and we’re committed to supporting businesses who may be struggling with their filing requirements during the coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to write to companies who are late filing their annual accounts or confirmation statement and help them bring their record up to date. </p>

<p>For a temporary period, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat late filing penalty appeals sympathetically - if the late delivery of accounts was caused by the coronavirus outbreak</li>
  <li>provide a break for companies to pay late filing penalties</li>
  <li>provide additional support with payment plans for late filing penalties</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="applications-for-voluntary-strike-off-ds01"> Applications for voluntary strike off (DS01)</h3>
<p>This temporary measure was lifted on 10 September 2020. We have resumed the process for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/companies-house-to-restart-the-voluntary-strike-off-process" class="govuk-link">companies who have applied for voluntary strike off</a>.</p>

<h3 id="strike-off-by-the-registrar">Strike off by the registrar</h3>
<p>This temporary measure was lifted on 10 October 2020. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/companies-house-to-resume-compulsory-strike-off-process" class="govuk-link">We have resumed the compulsory strike off process</a> for companies we believe are no longer carrying on business or in operation.</p>

<h3 id="late-filing-penalties">Late filing penalties</h3>
<p>If you do not apply for an extension before your filing deadline, and your accounts have been filed late, an automatic penalty will be imposed. The registrar has very limited discretion to not collect a penalty.</p>

<h3 id="paying-your-penalty">Paying your penalty</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/late-filing-penalties#paying-your-penalty" class="govuk-link">pay your penalty by BACS</a>.</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notify-a-purchase-of-own-shares" class="govuk-link">SH03 form</a> is normally sent to HMRC for stamping if the purchase is above the duty payable threshold.

<p>Companies House will accept and register an unstamped SH03 form if it’s accompanied by the letter from HMRC confirming that the correct duty has been paid.</p>

<p>We will also accept and register court orders sanctioning <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/stamp-duty-and-stamp-duty-reserve-tax-transfer-schemes-of-arrangement" class="govuk-link">schemes of arrangement</a> which are accompanied by either:</p>
