</ul>

<h2 id="the-withdrawal-agreement">The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-withdrawal-agreement-and-political-declaration" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a> sets out the terms of the UKâ€™s withdrawal from the EU and provides for a deal on citizensâ€™ rights. It sets out a transition period which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to live, work and study in the EU broadly as you did before 31 January 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Slovenia at the end of the transition period, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and your rights will be protected for as long as you remain resident in Slovenia.</p>

<p>Any rights that are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Read this guidance page for more information</p>

<p>In the meantime, make sure you are registered as a resident in Slovenia. We will update this guidance as soon as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="visas-and-residency">Visas and residency</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/slovenia/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">Check the entry requirements for Slovenia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="residency">Residency</h3>
<p>If you are resident in Slovenia before the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, you will be able to stay.</p>

<p>If you plan to stay in Slovenia for more than 90 days you need to register as a resident at your local <a rel="external" href="http://www.upravneenote.gov.si/" class="govuk-link">town hall (Upravna enota)</a> (in Slovene).</p>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your UK passport</li>
  <li>a passport photo</li>
  <li>your EHIC card</li>
  <li>a bank statement</li>
  <li>your work contract, if you are employed</li>
  <li>a pension statement, if you get a pension</li>
  <li>proof of school enrolment, if you are a student</li>
</ul>

<p>You must check with your town hall what further documentation you may need to apply for residency.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve held temporary residency in Slovenia for 5 years, you can apply to your town hall for a permanent resident certificate (Potrdilo o Stalnem Bivanju). Read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.si/en/policies/state-and-society/immigration-to-slovenia/" class="govuk-link">Slovenian governmentâ€™s guidance on entering Slovenia</a>.</p>

<p>If there are changes to residency registration processes, we will update this guidance as soon as information is available.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-slovenian-citizenship">Applying for Slovenian citizenship</h3>

<p>Once youâ€™ve been officially resident in Slovenia for 10 years (or 1 year if you are married to a Slovene national), you can <a rel="external" href="https://infotujci.si/en/third-country-nationals/slovenian-citizenship" class="govuk-link">apply for Slovenian citizenship</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to <a rel="external" href="http://www.upravneenote.gov.si/" class="govuk-link">apply for Slovenian citizenship at your local town hall</a>. You will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>submit a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx" class="govuk-link">UK criminal records check, known as a DBS check</a> when applying for citizenship, which must be certified and translated into Slovenian</li>
  <li>pass an exam in Slovene</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate" class="govuk-link">obtain a birth, marriage or death certificate from the UK</a>.</p>

<p>You may also be required to have all your UK documents <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/slovenia-list-of-translators-and-interpreters" class="govuk-link">officially translated</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised" class="govuk-link">legalised (apostilled)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>

<p>If you are living in Slovenia or move there permanently before 31 December 2020, youâ€™ll have life-long healthcare rights in Slovenia as you do now, provided you remain resident.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Slovenia, you must obtain basic state health insurance through the <a rel="external" href="http://www.zzzs.si/zzzs/internet/zzzseng.nsf" class="govuk-link">Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia (Zavod za zdravstveno zavarovanje Slovenije)</a>. You can also pay for supplementary health insurance through private insurance providers.</p>

<p>Read the Slovene governmentâ€™s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.si/en/policies/health/" class="govuk-link">healthcare arrangements</a>.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on who can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-slovenia" class="govuk-link">access healthcare in Slovenia and how to register.</a></p>

<h3 id="state-healthcare-s1">State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you live in Slovenia and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-slovenia#s1" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get an S1 form</a>.</p>

<h3 id="european-health-insurance-card-ehic">European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Slovenia, you must not use your EHIC from the UK for healthcare in Slovenia.</p>

<p>When you travel from Slovenia for a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland, you can use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare in that country. During that short stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no changes to your healthcare access before 31 December 2020. You can also continue to use your EHIC, as you did before, during this time.</p>

<p>You should also read guidance on:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>The rules on travel will stay the same until the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. During this time you can continue to travel to countries in the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> or elsewhere in the EU with your UK passport.</p>

<p>Check your passport is valid for travel before you book your trip. Your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>You can apply for or renew your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">British passport from Slovenia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-from-1-january-2021">Passports from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, you must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Slovenia, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p>You will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">renew your passport</a> before travelling if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may need to show a return or onward ticket and that you have enough money for your stay. You may also have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. Your passport may be stamped for visits to these countries.</p>

<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>
<p>From 1 January 2021, you will be able to travel to other Schengen area countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism. This is a rolling 180-day period.</p>

<p>To stay for longer, to work or study, or for business travel, you will need to meet the entry requirements set out by the country to which you are travelling. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit. You may also need to get a visa if your visit would take you over the 90 days in 180 days limit.</p>

<p>Periods of stay authorised under a visa or permit will not count against the 90-day limit. Travel to the UK and the Ireland will not change.</p>

<p>Different rules will apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen Area. Check each countryâ€™s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h2 id="driving-in-slovenia">Driving in Slovenia</h2>

<p>Driving licence rules will stay the same until 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Slovenia, you should exchange your UK licence for a Slovene driving licence. You can still use your Slovene licence in the UK for short visits or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test if you return to live in the UK.</p>

<p>For information on driving in Slovenia, read guidance on:</p>

</ul>

<p>Some applicants have been asked to prove residency in the UK at the time their UK licence was issued. The British Embassy has produced a letter which clarifies that UK driving licences are only issued to UK residents. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-consulate-ljubljana" class="govuk-link">Contact us</a> if you require a copy.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>
