<h2>What consular assistance is</h2>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) and UK embassies, high Commissions and consulates can help British nationals abroad in a range of circumstances. This includes, for example, supporting those who have lost their passport, been a victim of crime or who have been hospitalised or arrested.</p>

<p>In any given year, we support around 20,000 to 25,000 British nationals and their families, including approximately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>6,800 detained or arrested abroad</li>
  <li>4,500 who die abroad</li>
  <li>4,000 who are hospitalised</li>
  <li>1,600 who are victims of crime</li>
  <li>5,000 who need welfare support</li>
</ul>

<p>In complex cases, this support can last many years.</p>

<p>We also provide approximately 30,000 emergency travel documents to British nationals each year.</p>

<p>We expect British nationals to take responsibility for themselves and their safety while abroad. The help we can provide depends on the situation and the person’s circumstances. Specific advice for different situations is in our Support for British Nationals Abroad.</p>

<p>We do not charge for providing consular assistance, but some specific services, such as emergency travel documents, incur fees.</p>

<p>The provision of consular assistance is at our discretion and can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing information about the legal or judicial systems in the country you are in, and details for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters">interpreters</a> and other services. We cannot provide legal advice but can give you details of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers" rel="external">local lawyers</a>
</li>
  <li>providing contact information for local police and medical services if you have been the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/victim-of-crime-abroad">victim of crime</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/victim-of-rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad">sexual or violent assault</a>. Sometimes we may be able to accompany you to the police station to report a crime</li>
  <li>visiting or contacting you if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/arrested-or-detained-abroad">arrested or detained</a>, or serving a sentence in prison</li>
  <li>with your consent, providing information to family in the UK about your situation or raising concerns with the local authorities about any mistreatment</li>
  <li>if we are informed about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-do-after-a-british-national-dies-abroad">death of a British national abroad</a> and no family are present, asking the police to inform the family in the UK</li>
  <li>providing details on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/funeral-directors-worldwide-list">international funeral directors</a> and advice on how to register a death overseas</li>
  <li>enabling you to get an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">Emergency Travel Document</a> if you lose your British passport abroad. There is a fee for this service</li>
  <li>in some countries providing notarial services, for example a certificate of no impediment for someone getting married overseas. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notarial-services">fee for notarial services</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We may be able to provide specialist support in specific situations, for example relating to forced marriage, kidnappings, death though murder or manslaughter or where there are child safeguarding concerns.</p>

<h2>Contact us 24/7</h2>

<p>You can contact the FCDO 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by telephone, writing to us or sending us a message on social media.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you need to contact us urgently or in an emergency you should call the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a> or the FCDO in UK on +44 (0)20 7008 5000, selecting the option: ‘Consular services for British nationals’.</p>
</div>

<h2>How we can help</h2>

<p>Your first contact will be with our 24/7 team in our global Consular Contact Centre. They work with consular teams in the UK and at British embassies, high commissions and consulates to provide the most appropriate support. If you are asking about a service or assistance that we do not provide, we may be able to direct you to others who may be able to help. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fcdo-privacy-notice-consular-services-in-the-uk-and-at-british-embassies-high-commissions-and-consulates-overseas">consular services privacy notice</a> outlines how we process personal data.</p>

<p>Our trained teams will assess your request and situation. We will then aim to offer assistance which helps meets your needs. The nature of assistance that we can provide will depend on matters such as your specific circumstances, vulnerability, the laws and practices of the country you are in, as well as the availability of local services, such as police or medical facilities.</p>

<p>We seek to prioritise helping those British nationals who we assess as vulnerable and need our help most. We generally consider someone vulnerable when they cannot protect themselves from significant physical or emotional harm, or be protected by others. We also consider certain people as vulnerable, regardless of their circumstances, for example victims of rape and sexual assault, forced marriage cases, and situations involving children and young people.</p>

<p>We can provide consular assistance to British nationals who need our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas">help in a crisis</a>, for example following a natural disaster, civil unrest, terrorism or a major transport accident. We work with the appropriate authorities and other organisations to help those affected. We sometimes send additional FCDO staff to support in-country, when it is safe to do so.</p>

<h2>Prepare before you travel</h2>

<p>Before you travel, you should read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Travel Advice</a> for the countries you plan to visit. It includes information on entry requirements, the security situation, local laws and customs and other information to help you look after yourself whilst abroad.</p>

<p>You should ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport">passport is up to date</a>, is valid for the entire length of your time abroad and that you have completed the emergency contact details page</li>
  <li>you have any necessary visa or other entry requirements</li>
  <li>you have appropriate comprehensive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
  <li>you have checked on recommended vaccinations and other health requirements, for example to see if any medication you are carrying is permitted in the country you are visiting</li>
  <li>you have sufficient funds for your trip and that you can access these whilst you are travelling</li>
  <li>you are fit and well to travel, taking advice from health professionals if necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>You should consider telling someone you trust when and where you are going, and leaving them with copies of important documents, such as your passport and insurance details.</p>

<h2>When our help is limited</h2>

<p>The help we can provide will be limited if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are in a location where we have advised against all travel</li>
  <li>you need help in a country where we have no diplomatic or consular presence</li>
  <li>helping you could put others, including our staff, at risk</li>
  <li>you are abusive towards our staff</li>
  <li>you are a dual national in the country of your other nationality
</li>
</ul>

<p>Our consular staff are trained to deal with many situations, but sometimes we may refer you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>professionals in specialist areas, such as bereavement counsellors</li>
  <li>a partner organisation where we have an established relationship and we know that they can best provide the help you need</li>
  <li>a different UK government department or a non-governmental organisation or charity</li>
</ul>

<p>We provide lists of providers on GOV.UK and our teams can advise you where appropriate.</p>

<h2>What we cannot do</h2>

<p>Whilst we consider all requests for consular help from British nationals abroad, some requests are outside our remit. You do not have a legal right to consular assistance, and you should not assume assistance will be provided. Local authorities abroad will not treat you differently because you are British.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom has signed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=III-6&amp;chapter=3" rel="external">Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a>, the international treaty that provides the framework for consular services between countries. The treaty states that our staff must not interfere in the internal affairs of the host country when providing consular assistance.</p>

<p>We cannot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure your safety and security in another country. The relevant authorities in the country or territory you are in are responsible for your safety and security. You should take personal responsibility for researching your plans and prepare appropriately, and follow instructions from the authorities once you are there. Read and follow our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Travel Advice</a>
</li>
  <li>help you enter a country, or stop you being deported, for example, if you do not have a visa or your passport is not valid. Each country has the authority to decide who they allow into their country and who must leave</li>
  <li>investigate crimes or carry out physical searches for missing people. This is the responsibility of the local authorities</li>
  <li>get you out of prison, prevent the local authorities from deporting you after your prison sentence, or interfere in criminal or civil court proceedings. We must follow other countries’ systems</li>
  <li>get you better treatment in prison than is given to local people, although we may raise concerns with local authorities if treatment does not comply with internationally-recognised standards</li>
  <li>pay your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/your-finances-when-travelling-abroad">bills or give you money</a>
</li>
  <li>accept passport applications or issue new passports. Passports are issued by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Her Majesty’s Passport Office</a> in the UK. Only emergency travel documents are provided as part of our consular services</li>
  <li>provide you with legal advice or pay for these services for you. You should instruct a professional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers" rel="external">lawyer</a> if you need legal advice</li>
  <li>translate formal documents, provide formal interpreting services or pay for these services. You should contact a local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters">translators or interpreters</a>
</li>
  <li>get involved in private disputes or arrangements over property, employment, travel, commercial or other matters</li>
  <li>provide information about how foreign nationals can enter the UK, or their UK immigration status. Read more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration">about UK visas</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not provide consular assistance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-territories-governments-on-the-web/overseas-territories-governments-on-social-media">British Overseas Territories</a>. If you are visiting or resident in the British Overseas Territories, you should contact the local authorities if you need help.</p>
