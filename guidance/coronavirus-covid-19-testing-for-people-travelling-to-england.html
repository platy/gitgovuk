<p>If you do not qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England, you must take a COVID-19 test before you travel to England from abroad.</p>

<p>If you do qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England, you do not need to take a test before travel.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated">Read the Travel to England guidance to check if you qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England</a>.</p>

<p>Some people, including children aged 17 and under, are <a href="#exemptions--people-who-do-not-need-to-take-a-test" class="govuk-link">exempt from taking the test</a>.</p>

<h2>When to take your test</h2>

<p>You must take the test in the 2 days before your service to England departs.</p>

<p>For example, if you travel directly to England on Friday, you could take a test any time on the Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. The test result must be available for boarding.</p>

<p>If your journey to England is a multi-leg journey, you can take the test in the 2 days before the start of the first leg.</p>

<h2>Type of test</h2>

<p>The test must meet performance standards of ≥97% specificity, ≥80% sensitivity at viral loads above 100,000 copies/ml.</p>

<p>This could include tests such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a nucleic acid test, including a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>a LAMP test</li>
  <li>an antigen test, such as an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> (lateral flow device) test</li>
</ul>

<p>You must check with your test provider that the test meets the standards. You may not be able to travel if it does not.</p>

<p>The test could be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a face-to-face or in-person test</li>
  <li>a self-administered test</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you have recently had COVID</h3>

<p>If you have recently recovered from COVID but are no longer infectious, you should use a lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test. <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests have a lower sensitivity than <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or LAMP tests, so they are less likely to return a positive result from a historic infection. The <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test must meet the minimum performance standards as set out above.</p>

<h2>Where to take your test</h2>

<p>You will need to find a private test provider to take a test.</p>

<p>You can choose to take a test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the place where you start your journey</li>
  <li>in another country on your way to England, if you are travelling through another country</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">government travel advice pages</a> provide information about finding a testing provider.</p>

<h3>Taking a test on your journey to England</h3>

<p>If your journey to England is long, and will involve stopping in another country on the way, you should try to take a test in the country you’re travelling through. This is so you take the test in the 2 days before you board the final service to England.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re driving from Germany and you stop for a few days in Belgium, you should take a test in Belgium.</p>

<p>If your journey to England is a multi-leg journey, you can take the test in the 2 days before the start of the first leg. However, where possible, you should get a test within 2 days of your final departure point to England.</p>

<h3>Check that you will be able to get a test</h3>

<p>If you plan to take a test in a country on your way to England, you must make sure that this is possible before you set out. Some <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">countries have entry restrictions in place</a>, which mean you may not be able to get tested there.</p>

<p>If you do not have proof of a test because you planned to get tested on your journey, but you were not able to do so because you were not able to enter the country in which you planned to get tested, you will be allowed to board. But you may be fined £500 on arrival in England because you do not have a valid test result.</p>

<h3>Taking your test in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> before travel</h3>

<p>If you are returning to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> within 2 days, you can use the result of a COVID-19 test that you take in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> before you travel. You must use a private test provider for the test and not an NHS test.</p>

<p>The service on which you will arrive back in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> must set off for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> within 2 days of when you took the test, or within 2 days of the start of the first leg of your journey for multi-leg journeys.</p>

<h2>Positive test results</h2>

<p>If your test result is positive, you must not travel. You must follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">local rules and guidance</a> for positive coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>If the result is inconclusive, you must take another test.</p>

<p>British nationals who need consular assistance should contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">consulate, embassy or high commission</a>.</p>

<h2>How to provide proof of a negative test result</h2>

<h3>Proof for EU residents or citizens</h3>

<p>If you are an EU resident or citizen, you can use the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en" rel="external" class="govuk-link">EU Digital Covid Certificate (EU-DCC)</a> to provide proof of your test result. This can be in either digital or paper format.</p>

<p>If you are not an EU resident or citizen, you cannot use the EU-DCC to provide proof of your test result.</p>

<h3>Proof for non-EU residents and citizens</h3>

<p>You must provide the original test result notification. Your test result must be in either English, French or Spanish. Translations will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Your test result can be provided as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a printed document</li>
  <li>an email or text message you can show on your phone - make sure your device is charged</li>
</ul>

<p>It must include the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name, which should match the name on your travel documents</li>
  <li>your date of birth or age</li>
  <li>the result of the test</li>
  <li>the date the test sample was collected or received by the test provider</li>
  <li>the name of the test provider and their contact details</li>
  <li>confirmation of the device used for the test, or that the test was a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you do not have proof of a negative test result</h3>

<p>If you do not present proof you tested negative, you may not be able to board your transport to England.</p>

<p>If you arrive in England without proof you tested negative, you could be fined £500.</p>

<h2>NHS tests</h2>

<p>NHS tests cannot be used for the purpose of pre-departure testing before travel to England.</p>

<p>You cannot take an NHS test abroad with you to use on yourself before you return.</p>

<h2>Exemptions – people who do not need to take a test</h2>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Children aged 17 and under do not have to take a COVID-19 test before travel to England.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#travelling-with-children">Read more about children and COVID-19 travel tests in the Travel to England guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Children who have been in a red list country or territory</h4>

<p>Children aged 11 and under do not have to take a COVID-19 test before travel to England.</p>

<p>Children aged 12 to 17 who have been in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">red list country or territory</a> in the 10 days before they arrive in England must take a COVID-19 test in the 2 days before travel to England.</p>

<h3>Job and medical exemptions</h3>

<p>You do not need to take a test if you are travelling to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for urgent medical treatment or are accompanying someone who is travelling for urgent medical treatment, and it is not reasonably practical for you to obtain a negative COVID-19 test in the 2 days before departure</li>
  <li>if you have a medical condition which means you cannot take a test – you must present a note from a medical practitioner at check in and to Border Force staff on arrival in England</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people are exempt from some or all of the requirements <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules/coronavirus-covid-19-travellers-exempt-from-uk-border-rules" class="govuk-link">because of the job they do</a></p>

<h3>Travel from some countries</h3>

<p>You do not need to take a test if you began your journey to England from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Jersey or Guernsey</li>
  <li>Falkland Islands</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Helena or Ascension</li>
</ul>

<p>This applies even if you do not qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England.</p>

<h3>People who qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England</h3>

<p>You do not need to take a COVID-19 test before travel to England if you qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated" class="govuk-link">Check the Travel to England guidance to see if you qualify as fully vaccinated</a>.</p>
