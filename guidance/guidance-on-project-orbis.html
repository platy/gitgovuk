<p>The programme provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. It aims to deliver faster patient access to innovative cancer treatments with potential benefits over existing therapies.</p>

<p>Project Orbis is coordinated by the US Food and Drug Administration (<abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>). Alongside <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, it involves the regulatory authorities of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Australia (Therapeutic Goods Administration (<abbr title="Therapeutic Goods Administration">TGA</abbr>))</li>
  <li>Canada (Health Canada)</li>
  <li>Singapore (Health Sciences Authority (<abbr title="Singapore Health Sciences Authority">HSA</abbr>))</li>
  <li>Switzerland (Swissmedic)</li>
  <li>Brazil (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (<abbr title="Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária">ANVISA</abbr>))</li>
</ul>

<p>Project Orbis Partners (POPs) may propose products for inclusion in the scheme. Each country remains fully independent on their final regulatory decision.</p>

<h2>Products eligible for Project Orbis</h2>

<p>Applications submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> within a Project Orbis procedure must be new marketing authorisation applications (MAAs) or new indication applications (variations) for oncology products.</p>

<p>Authorisations will be applicable in Great Britain only as oncology medicinal products fall within the mandatory scope of the European Medicine Agency (EMA) centralised procedure that applies in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>You can find out more on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/about-us/what-we-do/authorisation-medicines#scope-of-the-centralised-procedure-section" rel="external">the EMA website</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> coordinate the selection of products that will be included. Initial enquires that <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> receive will be referred to the <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Submissions will only be forwarded to the <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> if they meet the qualifying criteria for the Innovation Passport within the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (<abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> and the Scottish Medicines Consortium (<abbr title="Scottish Medicines Consortium">SMC</abbr>) will collaborate within <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr> and a positive Innovation Passport designation is a requirement for inclusion in the Project Orbis programme.</p>

<p>You can find out more in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/innovative-licensing-and-access-pathway-ilap-for-medicines">guidance about <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr></a></p>

<p>Submissions will also need to meet the <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>’s clinical criteria for priority review.</p>

<p>If you want <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> to propose a product or new indication for the Project Orbis programme, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Orbis-MHRA@mhra.gov.uk">Orbis-<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>@mhra.gov.uk</a>  with a summary of the product explaining how you meet the eligibility criteria. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will arrange a meeting with you to discuss eligibility.</p>

<h2>Types of submissions</h2>

<p>There are three different types of submission depending on the timelines between the <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> and <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Type A</h3>

<p>Applications should be submitted concurrently or near-concurrently (within 30 days) to <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> and <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. These are termed Type A Orbis (Regular Orbis) and allow for maximal collaboration during the review phase and the possibility of concurrent action with <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Type B</h3>

<p>Applications submitted with a greater than 30-day delay or a regulatory action greater than 3 months of the <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> action are termed Type B Orbis (Modified Orbis) and allow the possibility of concurrent review with <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> but no concurrent action.</p>

<h3>Type C</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> has already taken regulatory action, a Type C Orbis (Written Report Only Orbis) will allows the <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> to share their completed review documents with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> but there is no concurrent review or action with <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Inclusion of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> in a Project Orbis Procedure</h2>

<p>Once a product or new indication has been identified for inclusion in Project Orbis, <abbr title="US Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> will contact the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> to request their interest in involvement. If the request is provisionally accepted by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, the parent US Company will be advised and should provide details of the local UK affiliate to <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> participation is contingent on agreement with the UK affiliate and inclusion of the product or new indication in <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the product or new indication is not already accepted for <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr>, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will arrange an Innovation Passport meeting as soon as possible after the request for inclusion in Project Orbis to confirm eligibility based on a review of the top-level clinical data. The meeting will also address practical arrangements for the submission, including the requirements for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>orphan products</li>
  <li>paediatric investigation plans (PIPs)</li>
  <li>pharmacovigilance including risk management plans (RMPs).</li>
</ul>

<p>Requests for meetings should be emailed to Orbis-<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>@mhra.gov.uk. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will then arrange a mutually acceptable date for the meeting.</p>

<p>For products and new indications already accepted in <abbr title="Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway">ILAP</abbr>, a meeting will be arranged to discuss practical arrangements for submission.</p>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>You will need to pay the relevant national authorisation fee for any applications made to Project Orbis.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees">our fees</a></p>

<h2>Assessment process and expert advice</h2>

<p>The multidisciplinary assessment teams will carry out the assessment of the application.</p>

<p>The assessment process will include consultation with the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Expert Advisory Groups  and the Commission on Human Medicines, as required.</p>

<h2>Publication</h2>

<p>The granting of a Great Britain marketing authorisation or new indication through Project Orbis will lead to publication of a Great Britain Public Assessment Report.</p>
