<h2>If you were living in Lithuania before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>Some parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Lithuania since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.</p>

<p>You should also read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe page</a> for detailed guidance about citizensâ€™ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus</h2>

<p>Follow the advice of the Lithuanian government and your local authority. You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lithuania">Lithuania travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>For information on getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a UK national in Lithuania, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lithuania/coronavirus">coronavirus travel advice</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>You must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lithuania/entry-requirements">entry requirements for Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to stay in Lithuania for longer than 3 months, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migracija.lt/stay-more-than-3-months" rel="external">apply for a residence permit from the Migration Department</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency if you were living in Lithuania before 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>If you have lived in Lithuania since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have rights under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights">Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you request the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migracija.lt/brexit" rel="external">â€˜leidimas gyventiâ€™</a>. This document shows that you have the rights defined in the Withdrawal Agreement. It also shows your right to enter Lithuania and exempts you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migracija.lt/brexit" rel="external">Migration Departmentâ€™s guidance on how to get the new permit</a>. It is free to exchange your current permit for the leidimas gyventi. If the leidimas gyventi is your first residence permit, you must pay 120 Euros.</p>

<p>You can ask staff from the Migration Department to visit you at home if you are unable to go to the Migration Department, due to disability, age or illness.</p>

<p>If you are a dual UK-Lithuanian national, you are considered a citizen of Lithuania. You will not be issued with the leidimas gyventi.</p>

<p>Your close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Lithuania at any time in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe">Living in Europe guidance</a>.</p>

<p>They must complete an application as a family member through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migracija.lt/app/auth/login" rel="external">MIGRIS e-system</a> and visit the Migration Department in Lithuania. Nationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Lithuanian authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-lithuania#coronavirus">Coronavirus travel restrictions</a> may affect travel to and from Lithuania.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/country/entry-requirements#passport-validity">Lithuania travel advice</a> for passport validity requirements.</p>

<p>Always carry your passport when travelling within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en" rel="external">Schengen area</a>. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Lithuania using your EU or EFTA passport.</p>

<p>If you stay in Lithuania with a Lithuanian residence permit or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.</p>

<p>If you visit other Schengen area countries outside Lithuania, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#visas-for-short-trips-you-do-not-need-one-if-youre-a-tourist">EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area</a>. Check each countryâ€™s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Lithuania before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>When you travel carry your residence document (leidimas gyventi) or frontier worker permit issued under the Withdrawal Agreement, in addition to your valid passport.</p>

<p>You must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at the border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of registration.</p>

<p>If you cannot prove that you are a resident in Lithuania, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence.</p>

<p>If you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Lithuania with a valid passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register for healthcare as a resident in Lithuania, and if necessary, for health insurance.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-lithuania">healthcare in Lithuania</a> and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.</p>

<p>Travel insurance is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#insurance-if-you-live-abroad-or-go-for-work-or-study">not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas</a>.</p>

<h2>Working in Lithuania</h2>
