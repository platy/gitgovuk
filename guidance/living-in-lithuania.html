<h2>The Withdrawal Agreement</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Lithuania before 1 January 2021, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-withdrawal-agreement-what-uk-nationals-need-to-know-about-citizens-rights" class="govuk-link">your rights will be protected by the Withdrawal Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>You should check that you are correctly registered and should get a new residence document to evidence your rights.</p>

<p>You should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-europe" class="govuk-link">read our guidance on living in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas and residency</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Lithuania before 1 January 2021, you need to exchange your residence permit. There is no deadline for exchange, you can use your current residence permit until it expires.</p>

<p>Family members who are third country nationals need to exchange their residence permit by 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.migracija.lt/brexit" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Migration Department’s guidance on how to get the new permit</a>.</p>

<h3>Moving to Lithuania</h3>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lithuania/entry-requirements" class="govuk-link">entry requirements for Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to stay in Lithuania for longer than 3 months, you must <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.migracija.lt/stay-more-than-3-months">apply for a residence permit from the Migration Department</a>.</p>

<h2>Driving in Lithuania</h2>

<p>If you are a resident in Lithuania you should exchange your UK licence for a Lithuanian licence. Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.regitra.lt/en/services/driving-licences">guidance on how to exchange your licence</a>.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad">what you need to drive abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lithuania/safety-and-security" class="govuk-link">road travel in Lithuania</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bringing a UK-registered vehicle to Lithuania</h3>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/registration/registration-abroad/lithuania/index_en.htm">EU’s guidance on car registration rules and taxes in Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>You may be exempt from some of these taxes. If so, you will need certificates of exemption.</p>

<h3>Driving in the UK with a Lithuanian licence</h3>

<p>You can use your Lithuanian licence in the UK for short visits, or exchange it for a UK licence without taking a test. We will update these pages if there are any changes to the rules, as soon as information is available.</p>

<h2>Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You should carry your residence document, as well as your valid passport when you travel. If you have applied but not yet received your document, carry your certificate of application.</p>

<p>If you have not yet applied for a residence document, you should carry evidence that you are resident in Lithuania. This could include a tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020.</p>

<p>If you cannot show that you are resident in Lithuania, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the Schengen area, and your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in Lithuania.</p>

<h3>Passports</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021">Check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports" class="govuk-link">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Lithuania.</p>

<p>You must have at least 6 months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe (not including Ireland). This requirement does not apply if you are entering or transiting to Lithuania, and you are in scope of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired, extra months may have been added to its expiry date. Any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the 6 months needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">Renew your passport</a> before booking your travel if you do not have enough time left on your passport.</p>

<p>As a non-EEA national, different border checks will apply when travelling to other EU or Schengen area countries. You may have to use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing. You may also need to show a return or onward ticket.</p>

<h3>Entry requirements</h3>

<p>You can travel to other <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/docs/schengen_brochure/schengen_brochure_dr3111126_en.pdf" class="govuk-link">Schengen area</a> countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa for purposes such as tourism.</p>

<p>To stay longer than 90 days in any 180-day period, to work or study, or for business travel, you must meet the entry requirements set out by the country you are travelling to. This could mean applying for a visa or work permit.</p>

<p>Periods of time authorised by a visa or permit will not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.</p>

<p>Different rules apply to EU countries that are not part of the Schengen area. Check each country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travel advice page</a> for information on entry requirements.</p>

<p>Travel to the UK and Ireland has not changed.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>

<p>You must register for healthcare as a resident in Lithuania, and if necessary, for health insurance.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-lithuania" class="govuk-link">guidance on accessing healthcare in Lithuania</a> and make sure you are correctly registered.</p>

<p>If your UK employer has sent you to Lithuania temporarily, your access to healthcare is different. Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-lithuania#posted-worker">access healthcare as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<h3>State healthcare: S1</h3>

<p>If you have a registered S1 form and were living in Lithuania before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare will stay the same if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>receiving some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker who lives in Lithuania and commutes to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-lithuania#s1">guidance on using an S1 form in Lithuania</a> to ensure you are correctly registered for healthcare.</p>

<h3>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h3>

<p>If you are resident in Lithuania, you must not use your UK-issued EHIC for healthcare in Lithuania.</p>

<p>If you were living in Lithuania before 1 January 2021, you may be eligible for a new UK-issued EHIC if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK student in Lithuania</li>
  <li>a UK State Pensioner with a registered S1</li>
  <li>a frontier worker with a registered S1</li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start" class="govuk-link">Apply now for a new UK EHIC</a>.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</p>

<p>For more information read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">guidance on healthcare when travelling in Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#travel-eu" class="govuk-link">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Working and studying in Lithuania</h2>

<p>If you were legally resident in Lithuania before 1 January 2021, you have the right to work, as long as you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad" class="govuk-link">working in an EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need to <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx">apply for a UK police certificate</a>.</p>

<h3>Frontier workers</h3>

<p>If you live in Lithuania and were regularly commuting to work in another EU or EFTA country, before 1 January 2021 you may need a permit to show you are a frontier worker.</p>

<h3>Studying in Lithuania</h3>

<p>You will be eligible for broadly the same support as Lithuanian nationals, as long as you were legally resident in Lithuania before 1 January 2021. Check that you are correctly registered for residency.</p>

<p>Read our guidance on:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-in-lithuania#studying-in-lithuania" class="govuk-link">healthcare for students in Lithuania</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to Lithuania to study</h3>

<p>If you are planning to study in Lithuania, make sure you meet all visa requirements before you arrive. Contact the relevant Higher Education provider in Lithuania to check what fees you may have to pay.</p>

<p>For more information read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-european-union-after-brexit">studying in the European Union</a>.</p>

<h2>Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double taxation agreement with Lithuania to ensure you do not pay tax on the same income in both countries. Ask the relevant tax authority your questions about double taxation relief.</p>

<p>Existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Lithuania have not changed.</p>

<p>Read guidance on:</p>

<ul>

<p>You should get professional advice on paying tax in Lithuania. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lithuania-list-of-lawyers" class="govuk-link">Find an English-speaking lawyer in Lithuania</a>.</p>

<h3>National Insurance</h3>

<p>Find out if you need to pay <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad" class="govuk-link">National Insurance in the UK or social security contributions</a> in Lithuania.</p>

<h3>Banking</h3>

<p>Whether UK banks can provide services to customers living in the EEA is a matter of local law and regulation. Your bank or finance provider should contact you if they need to make any changes to your product or the way they provide it. If you have any concerns about whether you might be affected, contact your provider or seek independent financial advice.</p>

<h2>Pensions</h2>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/benefits-and-pensions-for-uk-nationals-in-the-eea-or-switzerland" class="govuk-link">guidance on entitlement to UK benefits and pensions</a> while you are living in Lithuania.</p>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Lithuania, you can claim:</p>

<p>Many income-related benefits such as Pension Credit and Housing Benefit can’t be paid if you’re abroad for more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to claim some <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1119&amp;langId=en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Lithuanian social security benefits</a>.</p>

<h2>Voting</h2>

<p>You cannot vote in European Parliament elections.</p>

<p>You may be able to vote in some UK elections.</p>

<p>If you have a pet passport issued by Lithuania or another EU member state, you can use it to travel with your pet to Great Britain and elsewhere in the EU.</p>

<p>A GB-issued EU pet passport is not valid for travel to the EU or Northern Ireland. You should speak to your vet before you travel to get the necessary pet travel documents and ensure you’re compliant with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/pet-movement_en" rel="external" class="govuk-link">EU Pet Travel Regulations</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>Check the rules of the country you’re travelling to for any additional restrictions or requirements before you travel.</p>

<h2>Emergencies</h2>

<p>You should dial the European emergency number on 112 in Lithuania. See the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/112-lithuania" class="govuk-link" rel="external">full list of emergency numbers in Lithuania</a>.</p>

<h2>Returning to the UK</h2>

<p>Tell the UK and the Lithuanian authorities if you are returning to the UK permanently.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/returning-to-the-uk">returning to the UK permanently</a> which includes information on, amongst other things, tax, access to services and bringing family members.</p>
