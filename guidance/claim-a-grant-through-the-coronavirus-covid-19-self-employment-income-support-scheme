<p>If you receive the grant you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to work</li>
  <li>start a new trade or take on other employment including voluntary work and duties as a military reservist</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC will work out if you’re eligible and how much grant you may get. But you can follow these steps to help you understand how we will do this and what you can do now.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="check">Who can claim</h2>

<p>You can claim a grant if you’re a self-employed individual or a member of a partnership and your business has been <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/decide-if-your-business-has-been-adversely-affected-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">adversely affected due to coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>To make a claim for the second grant your business must have been affected on or after 14 July 2020.</p>

<p>All of the following must also apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted your Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year</li>
  <li>you traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020</li>
  <li>you intend to continue to trade in the tax year 2020 to 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot claim the grant if you trade through a limited company or a trust.</p>

<p>If you claim Maternity Allowance this will not affect your eligibility for the grant.</p>

<p>To work out your eligibility we will first look at your 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return. Your trading profits must be no more than £50,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income.</p>

<p>If you’re not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, we will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-hmrc-works-out-total-income-and-trading-profits-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">how we will work out your eligibility</a>.</p>

<p>Grants under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme are not counted as ‘access to public funds’, and you can claim the grant on all categories of work visa.</p>

<h3 id="how-different-circumstances-affect-the-scheme">How different circumstances affect the scheme</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">Check if your circumstances affect your eligibility</a> for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if your return is late, amended or under enquiry</li>
  <li>if you’re a member of a partnership</li>
  <li>if you had a new child</li>
  <li>if you have loans covered by the loan charge</li>
  <li>if you claim averaging relief</li>
  <li>if you’re a military reservist</li>
  <li>if you’re non-resident or chose the remittance basis</li>
  <li>state aid</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-youre-eligible">If you’re eligible</h2>

<p>If you want to claim the second grant you must make your claim on or before 19 October 2020.</p>

<p>You’ll have to confirm to HMRC, when you make your claim, that your business has been adversely affected by coronavirus on or after 14 July 2020.</p>

<h2 id="if-youre-not-eligible">If you’re not eligible</h2>

<p>We will work out your eligibility for the second grant in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-hmrc-works-out-total-income-and-trading-profits-for-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#how-we-work-out-the-amount-of-the-first-grant" class="govuk-link">same way as the first grant</a>. If you’ve previously requested a review please do not contact us again as your eligibility will not change.</p>

<p>We use the information you or your tax agent or adviser sent us on your Self Assessment tax returns to work out your eligibility.</p>

<p>If you think the information is incorrect <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/get-help-with-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC</a>.</p>

<p>Find <a href="#other" class="govuk-link">other help and support you can get</a>.</p>

<h2 id="howmuch">How much you’ll get</h2>

<p>You’ll get a taxable grant based on your average trading profit over the 3 tax years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2016 to 2017</li>
  <li>2017 to 2018</li>
  <li>2018 to 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>We will work out your average trading profit by adding together your total trading profits or losses for the 3 tax years, then we will divide by 3.</p>

<p>The second grant is worth 70% of your average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped at £6,570 in total. The online service will tell you how we’ve worked your grant out.</p>

<p>The first grant, for which applications closed on 13 July 2020, was based on 80% of your trading profits and capped at £7,500 in total.</p>

<p>The grant amount we work out for you will be paid directly into your bank account, in one instalment.</p>

<p>If you make a claim for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/self-employment-and-universal-credit" class="govuk-link">Universal Credit</a> the grant may affect the amount you get, but will not affect Universal Credit claims for earlier periods.</p>
