<p>Claims for the third SEISS grant have now closed.</p>

<p>The last date for making a claim for the third grant was 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to claims made during the third grant period.</p>

<p>Details about the fourth grant will be announced on 3 march 2021.</p>
</div>

<p>For the third grant, HMRC will check if you meet the eligibility conditions that are based on your trading profits and non-trading income on your Self Assessment tax returns.</p>

<p>You will then need to decide if you meet the other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme#whocanclaim">eligibility criteria</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re eligible for the third grant, you must have made a claim on or before 29 January 2021.</p>

<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">how different circumstances can affect eligibility</a> to the scheme, or amount of grant.</p>

<h2>Trading profits</h2>

<p>This is shown on your tax calculation as either profits from:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#self" class="govuk-link">self-employment</a></li>
  <li><a href="#part" class="govuk-link">partnerships</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We will work out your total trading profit after deducting any allowable expenses such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed">deductions</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/capital-allowances" class="govuk-link">capital allowances</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses" class="govuk-link">flat rate expenses</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If your annual gross trading income, from one or more trades or businesses is more than £1,000 you may have used the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-free-allowances-on-property-and-trading-income" class="govuk-link">tax-free allowances</a>, instead of deducting any expenses or other allowances.</p>

<p>We will work out your trading profit after deducting any tax-free allowances.</p>

<p>We will work out your share of the partnership’s trading profits by taking all partnership income, and then deduct anything that is non-trading income, such as investment income.</p>

<p>We will not deduct from your trading profits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any losses brought forward from previous years</li>
  <li>your personal allowance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Profits from self-employment</h3>

<p>We will work out your trading profit after allowable business expenses by adding any losses brought forward from previous years to the amount shown on your tax return as ‘total taxable profits from this business’.</p>

<h3>Profits from partnerships</h3>

<p>We will work out your share of the partnership’s profit after adjustments by adding any losses brought forward from previous years to the amount shown as ‘your share of the total taxable profits from the partnership’s business’.</p>

<h3>Paper short return</h3>

<p>Your trading profit after allowable business expenses is shown on your tax return as ‘profit’.</p>

<h3>Trading profit if you have claimed the trading allowance</h3>

<h3>If you have traded for all 3 tax years</h3>

<p>To work out your average trading profit we add together all profits and losses for all 3 tax years that you’ve had continuous trade, then divide by 3.</p>

<h3>If you did not trade in the tax year 2016 to 2017</h3>

<p>To work out your average trading profit we add together all profits and losses for the tax years 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019, then divide by 2.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>

</div>

<h3>If you did not trade in the tax year 2017 to 2018</h3>

<p>We will work out your average trading profit based on the tax year 2018 to 2019 only, even if you traded in the tax year 2016 to 2017.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>

<table>
  <thead>

<h2>Non-trading income</h2>

<p>This is the amount recorded as ‘total income received’ on your online or paper tax calculation, less your trading income.</p>

<p>This figure does not include losses.</p>

<p>HMRC will work out your non-trading income by adding together all your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>income from earnings</li>
  <li>property income</li>
  <li>dividends</li>
  <li>savings income</li>
  <li>pension income</li>
  <li>overseas income</li>
  <li>miscellaneous income (including taxable social security income)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>If you have traded for all 3 years we will first look at your 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return. Your trading profits must be no more than £50,000 and at least equal to your non-trading income.</p>

<p>If you’re not eligible based on the 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return, we will then look at the tax years 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, and 2018 to 2019.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <th scope="col">2016 to 2017</th>
      <th scope="col">2017 to 2018</th>

    <tr>
      <td>Trading profit</td>
      <td>£50,000</td>
      <td>£50,000</td>
      <td>-£10,000 - not eligible</td>
      <td>£30,000</td>
      <td>£90,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Non-trading income</td>
      <td>£15,000</td>
      <td>£15,000</td>
      <td>£15,000</td>
      <td>N/A</td>

      <td>No</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>No</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Eligibility using the 3 tax years</td>
      <td>N/A</td>

      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

</div>

<p>So even if you made a loss in the tax year 2018 to 2019, you would still be eligible because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your average trading profit for the 3 tax years is £30,000 - which is less than £50,000</li>
  <li>the sum of your trading profits for the 3 tax years is (£90,000) - which is at least equal to the sum of your non-trading income of £45,000 for those years</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme" class="govuk-link">If you have different circumstances</a> it can affect your eligibility.</p>

<h3>How we work out partnership eligibility</h3>

<p>If a partnership made £100,000 in trading profits in tax year 2018 to 2019, and distributed its profits as follows:</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th scope="col">Trading profits received</th>
      <th scope="col">Non-trading income</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Partner A</td>
      <td>£25,000</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Partner B</td>
      <td>£75,000</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Partner A would be eligible for the grant, as the trading profits received are no more than £50,000.</p>

<p>Partner B would not be eligible for the grant, as the trading profits received are more than £50,000.</p>

<p>If partnership rules require Partner A to pay the grant into the partnership pot, the partnership should give the full grant back to Partner A.</p>
