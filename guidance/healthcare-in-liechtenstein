<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<h2 id="HealthcareLiechtenstein">Healthcare in Liechtenstein after Brexit</h2>

<h3 id="if-you-currently-live-in-liechtenstein">If you currently live in Liechtenstein</h3>

<p>The UK has reached an agreement with Liechtenstein on citizens’ rights. This means that if there’s a no-deal Brexit, existing healthcare entitlements will be protected.</p>

<p>The agreement protects the rights of UK nationals who are living in Liechtenstein, and nationals of Liechtenstein who are living in the UK, before exit day.</p>

<p>Current healthcare arrangements will not change for UK nationals who are resident in Liechtenstein before the UK leaves the EU, for as long as they’re living in Liechtenstein and covered by the agreement. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students using a <a href="#EHIC">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>S1 holders, including UK nationals living in Liechtenstein at exit day who reach state pension age after Brexit</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a posted worker with a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or S1 certificate working in Liechtenstein before exit day, read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">national insurance if you go abroad</a>.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-move-to-liechtenstein-after-brexit">If you move to Liechtenstein after Brexit</h3>

<p>If you’re planning to move to Liechtenstein after Brexit, you need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-liechtenstein#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Liechtenstein</a>. There are very restrictive laws for foreign nationals wishing to live in Liechtenstein</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance to cover you while you’re applying for residency or if you’re not eligible for any local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>

<p>The existing healthcare entitlements of UK nationals who are living in Liechtenstein before exit day will be protected, even if there’s a no-deal Brexit. This is because of the Citizens’ Rights Agreement between the UK and Liechtenstein. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>S1 holders who are living in Liechtenstein before exit day</li>
  <li>UK nationals living in Liechtenstein before exit day who reach state pension age after Brexit</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not have an S1 certificate, you can continue to apply for one until the UK leaves the EU. It’s important to have all the right documentation and that it’s up to date.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-liechtenstein-after-brexit">Studying in Liechtenstein after Brexit</h3>

<p>If you’re a UK resident studying, or about to study, in Liechtenstein your UK-issued student <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will remain valid for the duration of your course, as long as you stay on it.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You can use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge, when visiting the UK after exit day if you’re living in Liechtenstein before exit day and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re moving to Liechtenstein after Brexit, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK.</p>

<p>You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you’ll be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="EHIC">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If your visit starts after the UK leaves the EU, your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there’s a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>If your visit starts before the UK leaves the EU, the Citizens’ Rights Agreement between the UK and Liechtenstein means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>existing healthcare entitlements will be protected</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid for the duration of your stay if there’s a no-deal Brexit</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Liechtenstein.</p>

<p>Check your travel insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need.</p>

<p>If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

</div>

<p>UK nationals living or working in Liechtenstein must follow the registration process to access the same entitlements to healthcare as Liechtenstein nationals.</p>

<p>Employers must register new EEA workers with the Migration and Passport Office within 10 days of them starting work. Employees then receive confirmation of their status as a cross-border commuter.</p>

<h3 id="uk-posted-workers">UK posted workers</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to health cover funded by the UK in Liechtenstein if you’re a worker posted by a UK company to Liechtenstein.</p>

<p>You can find out more from HM Revenue and Customs:</p>

<p>This information is about healthcare in Liechtenstein before Brexit. <a href="#HealthcareLiechtenstein">Find out about S1 certificates after Brexit</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Liechtenstein and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re eligible, apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate. An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Liechtenstein. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you’re a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://contactcentreservices.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/selfnhsukokb/AskUs_EHIC/en-gb/6696/application-forms-and-evidence/16477/s1-form-what-is-this-and-how-do-i-obtain-one">apply for an S1 certificate</a> through the Business Services Authority.</p>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit.</p>

<p>You can find more information under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in Liechtenstein at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free if you’re staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Make sure you’re treated by a healthcare provider in the state system as you’ll not be covered for private healthcare with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Liechtenstein if you have a pre-existing health condition.</p>

<p>You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel.</p>

<p>Take any documents about your health condition or medication with you.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling to have planned medical treatment, read the NHS guide about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">going abroad for medical treatment.</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-services-in-liechtenstein">Healthcare services in Liechtenstein</h2>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>

<p>Call 112 if you have a serious or life-threatening emergency.</p>

<p>There’s only one hospital in Liechtenstein in Vaduz. You do not need to be referred in emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="dentists">Dentists</h3>

<p>All dental care in Liechtenstein is private and must be paid for in full.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>

<p>There’s one hospital in Liechtenstein, the National Hospital, located in the capital city Vaduz. It runs alongside private practitioners.</p>

<p>You’ll need a referral from a doctor to be admitted to hospital, unless it’s in an emergency.</p>

<p>The Liechtenstein government also has agreements with some hospitals outside Liechtenstein, such as Austria and Switzerland, where patients are transferred for complicated or specialised treatments.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>

<p>Prescriptions are covered by statutory health insurance. When using your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, people of working age are charged 50%, and pensioners are charged about 10%.</p>

<p>Pensioners will have to declare they receive a UK State Pension to pay the lower rate.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-own-medicines-to-liechtenstein">Bringing your own medicines to Liechtenstein</h2>

<p>Some prescribed medicines contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in the UK. This means that additional legal controls apply to these medicines.</p>

<p>You may need a personal licence to take controlled medicines abroad.</p>

<p>Specific requirements also apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the information that you must take with you</li>
  <li>how you carry your controlled medicines</li>
</ul>
