<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Romania.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-romania" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts</a></p>
</div>

<p>This information is about living in Romania. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Romania</a>.</p>

<p>You need to register with your local Health Insurance House (CAS in Romanian) to access state healthcare in Romania.</p>

<p>You have to pay to use parts of the state healthcare system, although some parts are free.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Romanian healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying social security contributions</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">S1 form</a> with CAS</li>
  <li>paying for private health insurance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Romania</h2>
<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> in Romania if you’re living there for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>To access state healthcare, most people need to be making social security contributions and register with CAS.</p>

<p>Some people can register with CAS without making social security contributions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children under 18</li>
  <li>students aged 18 to 26 with no income (if they’re a registered Romanian resident)</li>
  <li>disabled people who have a certificate of proof</li>
  <li>pregnant women who earn below the Romanian minimum wage</li>
</ul>

<p>Your dependants (for example, a husband or wife with no income) are entitled to register with CAS through your social security contributions.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Romanian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>You must be a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania#visas-and-residency" class="govuk-link">resident of Romania</a> to register for state healthcare.</p>

<p>If you’re employed, your employer will register you with CAS. Your social security contributions will come out of your salary before you’re paid.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, you need to give a tax declaration to the tax authorities (Agenția Națională de Administrare Fiscală (<abbr title="Agenția Națională de Administrare Fiscală">ANAF</abbr>)) and arrange to make social security contributions. Then register with CAS.</p>

<p>If you are not working and you are not someone’s dependant, you need register with the tax authorities (<abbr title="Agenția Națională de Administrare Fiscală">ANAF</abbr>) and arrange to make social security contributions. Then register with CAS.</p>

<p>Once CAS has confirmed your application, you’ll get a health card (Card Național de Asigurări de Sănătate) in the post.</p>

<p>To register with a GP, go to your nearest CAS office. There’s a CAS office in the main city of each county.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>You have to pay to use parts of the state healthcare system in Romania, although some parts are free.</p>

<p>Charges are usually between 10% and 80% of the cost of treatment.</p>

<p>For prescription medicines, the minimum you’ll pay is 10% of the cost. The maximum you’ll pay is the full cost.</p>

<p>GP appointments and A&amp;E visits are both free of charge.</p>

<p>If you’re hospitalised because a doctor says you need to go to hospital, you may be charged around 2.50 euros when you’re discharged.</p>

<p>Dental care is not usually free, and most dentists have private practices. You can get emergency free dental care at some health centres and state hospitals.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Romania temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Romania using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Romania</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="#posted-worker">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania" class="govuk-link">living in Romania</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Romania before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Romanian system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Romania on the same basis as a Romanian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Romania than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Romania</h3>
<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> before registering your S1.</p>

<p>You must register your S1 form with CAS in your local area. There is a CAS office in the main city of each county.</p>

<p>Once registered, you’ll get a health card (Card Național de Asigurări de Sănătate). This will show you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Romanian citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Romania</h2>
<p>You can use an <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
