<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Romania.</p>

<p>This information is about living in Romania. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Romania</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You need to register with your local Health Insurance House (CAS in Romanian) to access state healthcare in Romania.</p>

<p>You have to pay to use parts of the state healthcare system, although some parts are free.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Romanian healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying social security contributions</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays when studying, or as a ‘posted’ (detached) worker</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued S1 form with CAS (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Romania’ below)</li>
  <li>paying for private health insurance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Romania</h2>

<p>If you are planning on moving to Romania, see the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania" class="govuk-link">Living in Romania</a> for more information about visa and residency requirements.</p>

<p>You must show proof of healthcare cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before you can register as a resident</li>
  <li>when you apply for a visa</li>
</ul>

<p>For details about the healthcare cover required for residency applications, contact local authorities in Romania or the appropriate Romanian embassy or consulate in the UK.</p>

<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> in Romania if you’re living there for more than 3 months.</p>

<p>To access state healthcare, most people need to be making social security contributions and register with CAS.</p>

<p>Some people can register with CAS without making social security contributions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children under 18</li>
  <li>students aged 18 to 26 with no income (if they’re a registered Romanian resident)</li>
  <li>disabled people who have a certificate of proof</li>
  <li>pregnant women who earn below the Romanian minimum wage</li>
</ul>

<p>Your dependants (for example, a husband or wife with no income) are entitled to register with CAS through your social security contributions.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Romanian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a UK S1 if you start drawing a UK State Pension (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Romania’ below).</p>

<h3>How to register for healthcare</h3>
<p>You must be a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania" class="govuk-link">resident of Romania</a> to register for state healthcare.</p>

<p>If you’re employed, your employer will register you with CAS. Your social security contributions will come out of your salary before you’re paid.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed, you need to give a tax declaration to the tax authorities (Agenția Națională de Administrare Fiscală (<abbr title="Agenția Națională de Administrare Fiscală">ANAF</abbr>)) and arrange to make social security contributions. Then register with CAS.</p>

<p>If you are not working and you are not someone’s dependant, you need register with the tax authorities (<abbr title="Agenția Națională de Administrare Fiscală">ANAF</abbr>) and arrange to make social security contributions. Then register with CAS.</p>

<p>Once CAS has confirmed your application, you’ll get a health card (Card Național de Asigurări de Sănătate) in the post.</p>

<p>To register with a GP, go to your nearest CAS office. There’s a CAS office in the main city of each county.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>

<p>You have to pay to use parts of the state healthcare system in Romania, although some parts are free.</p>

<p>Charges are usually between 10% and 80% of the cost of treatment.</p>

<p>For prescription medicines, the minimum you’ll pay is 10% of the cost. The maximum you’ll pay is the full cost.</p>

<p>GP appointments and A&amp;E visits are both free of charge.</p>

<p>If you’re hospitalised because a doctor says you need to go to hospital, you may be charged around 2.50 euros when you’re discharged.</p>

<p>Dental care is not usually free, and most dentists have private practices. You can get emergency free dental care at some health centres and state hospitals.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Romania temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Romania using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: getting and using using an S1 form in Romania</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance if you have an S1 as a ‘posted worker’ (see ‘If your UK employer has sent you to Romania temporarily (‘posted workers’)’ above).</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a resident in Romania and receive a UK State Pension or an exportable benefit. See <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/planning-your-healthcare/">Planning your healthcare abroad</a> on the NHS website for more information about eligibility.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Romanian system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Romania on the same basis as a Romanian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/global-health-insurance-card" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Romania than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<p>If you’re entitled to an S1 form as a dependant of a State Pensioner, your health cover will be cancelled once you begin claiming your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You will be sent a new S1 form to your registered address from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services. You must register this form to ensure continuation of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>You are responsible for informing NHS Overseas Healthcare Services if you change your address or your circumstances change.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services 
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension or another qualifying exportable benefit, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services (see contact details above).</p>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Romania</h3>
<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-romania">register as a resident</a> before registering your S1.</p>

<p>You must register your S1 form with CAS in your local area. There is a CAS office in the main city of each county.</p>

<p>Once registered, you’ll get a health card (Card Național de Asigurări de Sănătate). This will show you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Romanian citizen.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you are experiencing delays registering your S1 with local authorities and require emergency or urgent treatment, contact the Overseas Healthcare Services on 0044 191 218 1999.</p>
</div>

<h2>Studying in Romania</h2>
<p>You should apply for a Student <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> to get medically necessary, state-provided healthcare for the duration of your study period in Romania, whether this is for part or all of your course. This means that you’ll get necessary healthcare services on the same basis as a Romanian citizen either for free or at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>If you already hold a valid Student <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> you can use this until the card expires.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Read more about eligibility and how to apply</a></p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Because the NHS is a residency-based system, under NHS rules UK nationals who move abroad on a permanent basis may lose their entitlement to free NHS healthcare.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national and move to the EU, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK unless you have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, PRC or S2 to show your healthcare costs are funded by the EU country in which you now live, or another exemption applies.</p>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK war pensioners</li>
  <li>UK government employees</li>
  <li>UK nationals living in the EU on or before 31 December 2020, once they have a registered, UK-issued S1</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about using the NHS when you no longer live in the UK (see ‘UK nationals who no longer live in the UK’ in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-eu-and-efta-citizens-visiting-the-uk" class="govuk-link">Healthcare for visitors to the UK from the EU</a>).</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
