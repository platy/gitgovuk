<h2>HMCTS operational summary for week commencing Monday 25 January 2021</h2>

<p>Next week’s update will be issued on Friday 29 January 2021.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Updated:</strong> We held a webinar for legal professionals to provide information on the arrangements in place at courts and tribunals to meet the Government’s COVID-secure requirements and Public Health guidelines. We have published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hmcts-online-event-21-january-2021-court-safety-for-legal-professionals" class="govuk-link">recording of the webinar</a> and will soon publish written responses to all the questions submitted.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Updated:</strong> We <a href="https://insidehmcts.blog.gov.uk/2021/01/20/keeping-court-custody-suites-safe/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">published a blog</a> to outline the steps we are all taking to keep custody suites in court safe for all who use them, as well as the additional measures in place when producing defendants to a court hearing from a prison.</li>
  <li>If you live in an area where rapid (lateral flow device) COVID tests are being offered, we encourage you to get a test to support community efforts to help stop the spread of the virus. You can check with your local authority if tests are available in your area. If you choose to have a test and test positive, do not come to a court or tribunal building; <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-court-tribunal" class="govuk-link">contact the court or tribunal</a> to let them know; follow <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS advice</a>.</li>
  <li>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-to-expect-coming-to-a-court-or-tribunal" class="govuk-link">guidance on attending hearings during the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</li>
  <li>Our Acting CEO, Kevin Sadler, has posted a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://insidehmcts.blog.gov.uk/2021/01/15/working-together-in-the-safest-way-possible-to-keep-justice-going/">blog on working together in the safest way possible way to keep justice going for every complainant, victim, witness and defendant during the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</li>
  <li>The justice system remains open as an essential public service. Courts and tribunals continue to operate within the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national restrictions in England</a>, <a href="https://gov.wales/covid-19-alert-levels" rel="external" class="govuk-link">alert levels in Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels/">protection levels in Scotland</a>.</li>
  <li>All those essential to keeping the justice system running are considered critical workers. This applies to all those who work in courts and tribunals, as well as jurors and public court users, who are permitted to attend their place of work when necessary, to travel, to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home#travel">stay overnight in accommodation</a>. Critical workers can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision#critical-workers" class="govuk-link">access school places for children</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Reminder:</strong> We review and update our COVID risk assessments each week and apply any changes needed. You can ask for a copy from your local court. If you have any questions about how the risk assessment meets government guidance or how it’s being followed, you can raise your concerns following our escalation process. <span class="attachment-inline"><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/950997/HMCTS_COVID-19_escalation_routes_professional_users_6_January_2021.pdf" class="govuk-link">Escalation routes for professional users</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">266KB</span>, <span lang="en" class="page-length">3 pages</span>)</span>

<strong>Reminder:</strong> Court and tribunal users must continue to wear a face covering in all public and communal parts of our buildings. This includes robing rooms. This is in line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">Government advice on face coverings</a> (England), <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-guidance-public">Face coverings: guidance for public</a> (Wales) and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-phase-3-staying-safe-and-protecting-others/pages/face-coverings/" rel="external">COVID-19 stage 3: staying safe and protecting others</a> (Scotland).</li>

<h3>Crime</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Updated:</strong> New week, we will be opening a Nightingale Court in Cirencester, which will provide 2 extra courtrooms for non-jury trial Crown Court work.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Updated:</strong> Magistrates’ courts are facilitating the remote attendance of those involved in proceedings where the court has directed, and is able to facilitate, this. The safe operation of courts remains paramount so listing volumes are being adjusted to reduce the number of people coming to court, in line with the Lord Chief Justice’s recent statement. Updated guidance has been issued to those still required to attend in person.</li>
  <li>We’ve installed plexiglass screens into over 450 courtrooms and jury deliberation rooms. More than 290 courtrooms have been assessed as being capable and available to hold jury trials, in addition to over 120 courtrooms for non-jury trial work across 79 Crown Court sites.</li>
  <li>79 Crown Courts have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/crown-courts-that-have-resumed-jury-trials">resumed jury trials</a>, as well as 6 other existing court venues and 6 Nightingale Courts sites who have started to hold jury trials.</li>
  <li>The Crown Court is hearing all types of applications and cases, including multi-hander trials. Where appropriate, judges continue to deal with a range of work remotely, including sentencing hearings.</li>
  <li>The judiciary has published a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/07072020_-Amended-Note-on-Listing-Magistrates-re-breaches_APPROVED-3.pdf">note of listing in magistrates’ courts during coronavirus outbreak</a>.</li>
