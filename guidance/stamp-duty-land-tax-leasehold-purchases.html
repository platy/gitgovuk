<h2>Overview</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You do not pay SDLT if you buy a property in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scotland from 1 April 2015 — you pay <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sdlt-scottish-transactions">Land and Buildings Transaction Tax</a>
</li>
  <li>Wales from 1 April 2018 — you pay <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/stamp-duty-land-tax-welsh-transactions">Land Transaction Tax (LTT)</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The amount of <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> you pay when you buy a leasehold property, depends on if it’s an existing lease (an assigned lease) or a new one.</p>

<h2>Assigned leases</h2>

<p>Residential and non-residential properties are leasehold or freehold.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>A developer builds some flats and sells them on 99 year leases. You buy one of the 99 year leases and sell it when it still has 88 years to run. You assign the lease to the new owner for the rest of the period.</p>

<p>The new owner pays a lump sum for the assignment of the lease and pays <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on this amount.</p>

<p>In most cases, use the same <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax/residential-property-rates">rates and thresholds</a> to work out the amount of <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> as you would if you bought a freehold property (residential or non-residential freehold).</p>

<h3>Filling in the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> return</h3>

<p>The rules for filling in the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> return for an assigned lease are the same as the rules for a freehold property. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/stamp-duty-land-tax-online-returns">Fill in a return</a> if the sale price is £40,000 or more, even if no <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> is due.</p>

<h2>New leases</h2>

<p>If you buy a new lease, the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> you pay depends on the amount of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the premium</li>
  <li>any rent due</li>
</ul>

<h3>New leases with a nominal rent</h3>

<p>When you buy a new lease and pay a premium, but only a nominal rent (a peppercorn for example), calculate <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on the amount of the premium only. This applies for both a residential or non-residential lease.</p>

<p>Calculate the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on the premium in the same way as you would for the sale price of a freehold property. Fill in an <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> return if the sale price is £40,000 or more, even if no <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> is due. If the lease is less than 7 years and no tax is due, you do not need to do a return.</p>

<h3>New leases with more than a nominal rent</h3>

<p>If you buy a new lease, pay a premium and more than a nominal rent, work out the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the premium</li>
  <li>the value of rent payable over the term of the lease at present day prices (net present value (<abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr>))</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally, you only pay <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on the rent if it’s high. It depends on the length of the lease, for example £4,500 a year for a 99 year lease.</p>

<h3>Calculations for residential or non-residential leases</h3>

<p>There are different rules to work out the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on new residential and non-residential leases.</p>

<p>Residential property is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a building used or suitable to use as a private home</li>
  <li>a building adapted to use as a private home</li>
  <li>land that’s the garden or grounds of a private home (including a right or interest in that land)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you buy 6 or more separate properties in one transaction, it counts as non-residential.</p>

<h3>New residential leases</h3>

<p>When you buy a new residential lease, work out both the amount due on the premium and on the rent. Add them together for the total amount due.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on the premium</h3>

<p>Work out the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on the premium as if it was the sale price of a freehold property. Do not take into account the level of the rent due under the lease.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>You pay a premium of £275,000 on a new residential lease, you pay&nbsp;<abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>&nbsp;at the rate of 0% on the first £250,000 and 5% on the rest (£25,000). The amount you pay is £1,250.</p>

<p>If you purchased a new residential lease before 23 September 2022, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-stamp-duty-land-tax">different <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> rates and thresholds applied</a>.</p>

<h3>The <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> of the rent</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> of the rent is more than the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> threshold on residential property, the buyer pays <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on the rent in addition to any <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> due on the premium.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> is due on the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr>, you must calculate the tax at a flat rate of 1% on the amount of the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> that’s over the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> threshold. If you’ve already used the threshold, for example with a linked lease, then use 1% on the total <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> to calculate the tax.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>You are granted a new residential lease. The&nbsp;<abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr>&nbsp;of the rent under the lease is £260,000, the amount of the&nbsp;<abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr>&nbsp;that’s over the £250,000 residential threshold is £10,000. Pay&nbsp;<abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>&nbsp;on £10,000 at 1%. Add this to the amount of&nbsp;<abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>&nbsp;due on the premium.</p>

<p>If you purchased a new residential lease before 23 September 2022, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-stamp-duty-land-tax">different <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> rates and thresholds applied</a>.</p>

<h3>Fill in the return</h3>

<p>For new leases, fill in the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> return even if there’s no <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> due, unless either the lease is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7 years or more, the premium is less than £40,000 and the annual rent is less than £1,000</li>
  <li>less than 7 years and you do not pay <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on any part of the premium or rent</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sdlt-online">Fill in the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> return online</a> and calculate and pay any tax due.</p>

<h2>Calculate <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on new non-residential leases</h2>

<p>The amount of <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> due when you buy a new non-residential lease depends on the amounts of the premium (or purchase price of the lease) and rent you pay under the lease.</p>

<h3>The premium</h3>

<p>If the annual rent for the lease (not the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr>) is less than £1,000, as a buyer you pay <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on the premium. This is at the same rate you would pay on the sale price of a freehold non-residential property. This means you’ll only have to pay <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> if the premium is more than the threshold.</p>

<p>From 17 March 2016 you do not have to pay <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on the premium for annual rents of £1,000 or more if the premium is under the £150,000 non-residential threshold. The ‘£1,000 rule’ has been abolished from this date.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>You pay a premium of £280,000 for some office space. The <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> due would be calculated as follows:</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> of the rent</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> of the rent is over the non-residential <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> threshold (£150,000), you pay <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> on the rent as well as on the premium.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> of the rent for a non-residential lease is £5,100,000. The <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> due would be calculated as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Charge</th>
      <th scope="col">Rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

<h3>Calculate the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> of the rent</h3>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/calculate-stamp-duty-land-tax/#/intro" rel="external"><abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> lease transactions calculator</a> to work out the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> and the amount of any <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> due. Select ‘residential’ or ‘non-residential’ as appropriate, for the property type. Make sure you’ve these details to hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>effective date of the transaction — usually the date of completion</li>
  <li>start and end dates as shown in the lease</li>
  <li>total premium payable (for non-residential or mixed used properties)</li>
  <li>rent payable in each of the first 5 years, if you know it</li>
</ul>

<p>If the term of the lease is longer than 5 years, the calculator will work out the amount of <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> due by taking the highest rent payable in the first 5 years. It will apply that amount to each year of the rest of the term.</p>

<h3>If <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is payable on the rent</h3>

<p>Include any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> payable on the rent in the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> calculation. Use the rates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 January 2010 to 3 January 2011 inclusive — 17.5%</li>
  <li>4 January 2011 onwards — 20%</li>
</ul>

<h3>All or part of rent unknown or uncertain</h3>

<p>When you buy a lease, you may not know how much the rent will be each year, for example because the amount depends on how well the business does.</p>

<p>In this case, when you work out the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> of the rent, estimate what the rent will be to calculate the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> due. Then, recalculate the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> when either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you know the actual amount of the rent</li>
  <li>the first 5 years have passed</li>
</ul>

<p>If your recalculation shows that the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> is more than the amount you used on your original <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> return, tell HMRC and pay any extra tax due.</p>

<p>Write to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/stamp-duty-enquiries-shares-and-land">Birmingham Stamp Office</a> within 30 days of the review date to tell them the revised figure for the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr>. Include the extra payment due. You must write even if you made the original notification online.</p>

<p>If your recalculation shows that you overestimated the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> and paid too much <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr>, write to claim a refund.</p>

<h3>Term of lease is unknown or indefinite</h3>

<p>If you do not know the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/stamp-duty-land-tax-manual/sdltm14045">term of the lease</a> or it’s not definite, count it as a lease for a fixed term of one year to calculate the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr>. If it carries on after the end of the first year, count it as a lease for a fixed term of 2 years and so on for as long as it continues. This is a ‘growing lease’.</p>

<p>If the lease is a growing lease, fill in the <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> return if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> is due when the lease is granted</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> becomes due as the lease continues</li>
</ul>

<p>If a tenancy carries on from one period to the next it’s called a ‘periodic tenancy’ (unless either party gives notice to end it). This is the most common example of an indefinite lease.</p>

<h3>Lease surrendered and new lease granted on the same property</h3>

<p>There are special rules to use when a landlord surrenders a lease early and grants a new lease to the same tenant for the same property.</p>

<h4>Original lease granted on or after 1 December 2003</h4>

<p>If the rent for the new lease is higher than the rent for the old one, calculate the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> for the period covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the start of the new lease</li>
  <li>the date when the old lease was due to end — use only the amount of rent increase</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an overlap period and you may be able to claim <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/stamp-duty-land-tax-manual/sdltm16020">overlap relief</a>.</p>

<h4>Original lease granted before 1 December 2003</h4>

<p>If the original lease was a ‘Stamp Duty lease’ and granted before <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> was introduced on 1 December 2003, use the whole rent for the term of the new lease to calculate the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Original lease granted on or after 17 March 2016</h4>

<p>If the rent for the new lease is higher than the rent for the old one, calculate the <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr> for the period covering the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>start of the new lease</li>
  <li>date when the old lease was due to end — use only the amount of rent increase</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an overlap period and you may be able to claim <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/stamp-duty-land-tax-manual/sdltm16020">overlap relief</a>.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>The monthly rent increases by £200 at the start of the new lease, and the old lease is due to end 12 months later, the amount of rent taken into account for this period is £2,400. Then, take into account the full rent due for the rest of the term of the new lease.</p>

<p>If you have problems with the calculation, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/stamp-duty-enquiries-shares-and-land">Birmingham Stamp Office</a>.</p>
