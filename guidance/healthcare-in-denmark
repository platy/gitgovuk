<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>
</div>

<p>This content was originally published on the NHS website.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-denmark">Healthcare in Denmark after Brexit</h2>
<p>You should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national living in Denmark.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Croatia in place.</p>

<p>For example, if you are a current S1 form holder, or a posted worker or student using a <a href="#ehic">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>, you will not be able to rely on these to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<h3 id="if-youre-living-in-denmark">If you’re living in Denmark</h3>
<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-denmark#visas-and-residency">registering as a resident in Denmark</a>. You can find information on how to do this on the <a rel="external" href="http://um.dk/en/travel-and-residence/brexit/">Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark website</a>
</li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Denmark</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency, or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<h3 id="arrangement-with-denmark-if-theres-no-deal">Arrangement with Denmark if there’s no deal</h3>
<p>Denmark has put in place no-deal legislation which extends existing EU rights on residence for all British citizens and their family members legally residing in Denmark on exit day. You can get more information from the <a rel="external" href="http://um.dk/en/travel-and-residence/brexit/">Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark</a>.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>
<p>Your S1 certificate may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Denmark and may mean you need to pay in full for treatment. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-denmark-after-brexit">Studying in Denmark after Brexit</h3>
<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Denmark before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>
<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>
<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK if you are living in Denmark and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Denmark before Brexit, you can use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge when visiting the UK after exit day if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>
<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinarily resident test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="ehic">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>
<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Denmark and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Denmark.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need.</p>

<p>If you have any pre-existing health conditions, talk to your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>You should prepare for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national travelling to Denmark.</p>

<p>UK-issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">EHICs</a> will still be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 if you need more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to liaise with a different team depending on the exportable benefit. You can find more information under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Denmark. The government always advises UK nationals to take out comprehensive travel insurance when going overseas. Your <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> is not an alternative to travel insurance and you should have both when you travel abroad.</p>

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in Denmark at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free, if you’re staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Make sure you’re treated by a healthcare provider in the state system as you will not be covered for private healthcare with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>
<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Denmark if you have a pre-existing health condition. You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>The Money and Pensions Advice Service has information about buying <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions">travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medicine with you.</p>

<p>If you are travelling to have planned medical treatment, read the NHS guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">seeking medical treatment in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-services-in-denmark">Healthcare services in Denmark</h2>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>
<p>If you have a serious or life-threatening emergency or you need an ambulance, call 112. This number is free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="dentists">Dentists</h3>
<p>You will be covered for consultations with a dentist if you have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. The dentist must be registered with the state health service.</p>

<p>If you have to pay any fees, these will be partially reimbursed.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>
<p>Doctor’s referrals are required for non-emergency hospital treatment.</p>

<p>Emergency hospital treatment in a state hospital is free for people with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. Examinations from a doctor or midwife during pregnancy and childbirth are also free of charge.</p>

<p>Where possible, tell the hospital that you’ll need the service before your arrival.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>
<p>Prescription medicine is paid for by the patient. However, support is given for specific types of medicine (support-based medicine) by the public healthcare system depending on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how much medicine is bought within a year</li>
  <li>whether the patient is an adult or a child</li>
</ul>

<p>Most pharmacies are open from 9.30am to 5pm on weekdays and 9.30am to 12pm on Saturdays. Some are open until 2pm on Saturdays.</p>

<p>There are also some 24-hour pharmacies (døgnåbne apoteker).</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-own-medicines-to-denmark">Bringing your own medicines to Denmark</h2>
<p>Some prescribed medicines contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in the UK. This means that additional legal controls apply to these medicines.</p>

<p>You may need a personal licence to take controlled medicines abroad.</p>

<p>Specific requirements also apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the information that you must take with you</li>
  <li>how you carry your controlled medicines</li>
</ul>
