<p>There are <a class="govuk-link" href="#list">30 species of invasive non-native (alien) animal</a> that are listed as of concern to the EU because of their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>invasiveness</li>
  <li>ability to establish in several nations across Europe</li>
</ul>

<p>They cause severe problems for native animals and the environment.</p>

<h2>Restrictions on invasive alien animals</h2>

<p>You must follow strict laws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when owning or looking after them</li>
  <li>if you find one</li>
  <li>when selling or displaying them as part of your business</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not do any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep them in your house, garden or business</li>
  <li>sell them to other people</li>
  <li>exchange them for goods</li>
  <li>release into the environment</li>
  <li>let them breed or escape</li>
  <li>import them into the UK</li>
  <li>transport them within the UK</li>
  <li>export them to other countries</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules apply to any live species and any part that might reproduce, such as eggs that will hatch.</p>

<h2>Exemptions</h2>

<p>You might be exempt if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#pet">owned one as a pet</a> before the species was listed</li>
  <li>have a permit or licence to keep them in certain circumstances, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="#research">research or conservation</a>
</li>
  <li>are still within <a class="govuk-link" href="#limits">certain time limits</a> to sell them</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leaving the EU</h2>
<p>From 1 January 2021, the same rules will still apply.  The EU laws remain in force and become UK law. This is known as ‘retained EU law’.</p>

<h2>Keeping as pets (‘companion animals’)</h2>

<p>If you kept one of these animals as a pet in the UK <a class="govuk-link" href="#list">before it was listed</a>, you can keep it for the rest of its life without a permit or licence as long as all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you keep it as a pet and not for any business reason</li>
  <li>you keep it in a ‘contained holding’ that it cannot escape from, for example, a cage or aquarium</li>
  <li>you do not let it breed</li>
  <li>you do not sell or exchange it</li>
</ul>

<p>If you got the animal <a class="govuk-link" href="#list">after it was listed</a> without realising it’s an offence, you must contact one of the following for guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#NE">Natural England</a>, if you’re in England</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#NRW">Natural Resources Wales</a>, if you’re in Wales</li>
  <li>the wildlife crime officer at your <a class="govuk-link" href="#police">local police force</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You must not release your pet into the wild. You may be prosecuted if you do this.</p>
</div>

<h3>Preventing your pet from breeding</h3>

<p>You must not allow your pet to breed.</p>

<p>You could be prosecuted or fined if you allow this. Your animal could also be confiscated.</p>

<p>You do not have to spay or neuter your pet but you may choose to do this to stop it breeding.</p>

<h3>Identifying your pet</h3>

<p>You should microchip your pet.</p>

<p>A microchip will help you find your pet if it escapes. It’s also evidence of how long you’ve owned your pet.</p>

<p>If you cannot microchip your pet, try to mark it with identification in some other way.</p>

<h3>Walking your pet</h3>

<p>You must not take your pet out for walks, even on a lead. Your pet must stay in a contained holding at your home.</p>

<h3>Transporting your pet</h3>

<p>You can transport your animal, for example if you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>move house</li>
  <li>take it to vet</li>
</ul>

<p>When you transport it, you must keep it in a contained holding, such as a pet carrier, to make sure it cannot escape.</p>

<h3>Pet boarding</h3>
<p>You can take your animal to pet boarding or to a friend’s house, as long as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you keep it under control when transporting it</li>
  <li>it cannot escape</li>
</ul>

<p>The person looking after it must keep your animal in a contained holding and not allow it to escape or breed. They do not need a licence to look after your pet on a temporary basis.</p>

<h3>Rehoming your pet</h3>

<p>You can take it to an animal rescue centre where they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep it for the rest of its life</li>
  <li>rehome it with a new owner</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also give it to someone else, but you cannot sell or exchange it for money or other goods.</p>

<p>Give the new owner or rescue centre evidence that you got your pet before the species was listed so they have proof the animal can be kept without breaking the law.</p>

<p>Evidence could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a signed and dated transfer form from the owner before you, confirming the date of birth</li>
  <li>a dated receipt for when you bought the animal (the date must be before the species was listed)</li>
  <li>a signed statement from a vet or copy of your vet records, with the date the animal was registered at the vets</li>
  <li>a breeding certificate, showing the date of birth</li>
  <li>a dated microchip certificate</li>
  <li>dated copies of pet insurance paperwork</li>
  <li>adoption paperwork, showing the date it was adopted</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also take your pet to a vet to be put to sleep.</p>

<p>You must not release your pet into the wild.</p>

<h2>Rescue centres</h2>

<p>If you run a rescue centre, you can keep a listed invasive alien animal for up to 6 weeks without a permit or licence on a temporary basis.</p>

<p>If it was a companion animal, it can be rehomed as a companion animal.</p>

<p>If it is a widely spread species and not kept as a companion animal, you can rehome it with a person who holds the correct licence.</p>

<p>If it is a non-widely spread species, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">contact Natural England or Natural Resources Wales</a> for guidance.</p>

<p>While you’re temporarily minding the animal, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep it in a contained holding</li>
  <li>stop it from escaping or breeding</li>
</ul>

<p>Once it’s rehomed, the new owner can keep it without a permit.</p>

<p>Give the new owner evidence that it was acquired legally, before the animal was listed. Evidence could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a signed and dated transfer from the previous owner, completed when the animal was taken to the centre, confirming the date of birth when they got it</li>
  <li>a dated receipt for the animal (the date must be before the species was listed)</li>
  <li>a signed statement from a vet or copy of the vet records, with the date the animal was registered at the vets</li>
  <li>a breeding certificate, showing date of birth</li>
  <li>a dated microchip certificate</li>
  <li>dated copies of pet insurance paperwork</li>
  <li>adoption paperwork, showing the date it was adopted</li>
</ul>

<p>If the animal was acquired after the species was listed, you must contact one of the following for guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#NE">Natural England</a>, if you’re in England</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#NRW">Natural Resources Wales</a>, if you’re in Wales</li>
  <li>the wildlife crime officer at your <a class="govuk-link" href="#police">local police force</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keeping an animal long term</h3>

<p>If you want to keep an animal in rescue long term, you’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/invasive-alien-species-licence-to-move-and-keep-them-in-captivity-ias-a01">get a licence</a>.</p>

<p>This applies if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the animal is a wildly spread species taken from the wild and you’ll keep it in captivity for the rest of its natural life</li>
  <li>you believe it was a companion animal but you cannot find the owner and you’ll keep it in captivity for the rest of its life</li>
</ul>

<p>If it is a non-widely spread species, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">contact Natural England or Natural Resources Wales</a> for guidance.</p>

<h2>If you find a listed invasive alien animal in the wild or on your land</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you find a <a class="govuk-link" href="#list">non-widely spread species</a> on your land or in the wild, you must report it to the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nonnativespecies.org/index.cfm?sectionid=81" rel="external">GB non-native species secretariat</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you find a <a class="govuk-link" href="#list">widely spread animal</a>, you do not have to take any action.</p>

<p>If you work in wildlife management, and can do so,  you should <a class="govuk-link" href="#action">take management action</a>, for example, such as setting traps or using deterrents.</p>

<h3>Releasing an accidentally restrained animal</h3>
<p>If an animal has been accidentally caught, for example, it’s trapped in wire netting, you can release it.  This is not considered intentional release.</p>

<p>You should not take listed animals out of the wild and into your own possession.</p>

<p>If you’ve already taken an animal out of the wild, for example, to a vet or to keep it yourself, you must not release it back into the wild. This would be an offence. You must now take it to a rescue centre where they’ll need a licence to keep it.</p>

<h3>If you work in wildlife management</h3>

<p>If you’re controlling a wildlife population using humane measures, such as setting traps, then you must be trained and equipped to set traps properly.</p>

<p>You should take reasonable steps to avoid capturing non-targeted animals. If you do catch a listed invasive alien animal unintentionally, and have the correct training and equipment, you should try to humanely kill the animal, if possible.</p>

<p>You can also take it to a licensed or permitted holding.</p>

<h3>Monitoring and research</h3>

<p>If you accidentally catch a listed invasive alien animal during ringing or monitoring operations of other animals, you will not have committed an offence if you immediately release it.</p>

<p>You can also take it to a licensed or permitted holding.</p>

<h3>Find a licensed or permitted holding</h3>

<p>To find one, contact any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#NE">Natural England</a>, if you’re in England</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#NRW">Natural Resources Wales</a>, if you’re in Wales</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#APHA"><abbr title="Animal Plant and Health Authority">APHA</abbr></a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Animal retailers</h2>

<p>You must not sell listed invasive alien animal species except in limited circumstances set out in this section.</p>

<h3>Existing stock</h3>

<p>If you have animals in stock from <a class="govuk-link" href="#list">before they were listed</a>, you have 12 months from the time they were listed to sell the animal to a member of the public.</p>

<p>A member of the public can buy one of these animals from you and keep it until the end of its natural life without a permit or licence as long as they make sure it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is kept in a contained holding, such as a cage</li>
  <li>cannot breed or escape</li>
</ul>

<p>You should keep proof of purchase to show when you bought the animal. You can then pass this on to the new owner.</p>

<p>You have 24 months from the time the animal was listed to sell or transfer to an establishment that has the <a class="govuk-link" href="#permit">correct permit from <abbr title="Animal Plant and Health Authority">APHA</abbr></a>. It’s your responsibility to make sure the new owner has the correct permit.</p>

<p>You can also contact a vet to put an animal to sleep, to reduce your stock.</p>

<h3>Outside the time limits</h3>

<p>If you have stock and you’re outside the 12 or 24 month time limits, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">Natural England or Natural Resources Wales</a> for guidance.</p>

<h3>Stock that you got without realising it was a listed species</h3>

<p>You cannot legally keep these animals. You can only try to rehome them at locations that have permits where they can be kept until the end of their lives. <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">Contact Natural England or Natural Resources Wales</a> for guidance.</p>

<p>You must not release these animals into the wild.</p>

<h2>Animal encounter  businesses</h2>

<p>You must not use these species in shows or exhibitions that allow the public to interact with these animals.</p>

<p>You cannot keep an encounter animal as a pet if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been previously kept for commercial reasons</li>
  <li>it came into your possession after the species was listed</li>
</ul>

<p>You can email <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">Natural England or Natural Resources Wales</a> for advice on what to do if you still own animals that you can no longer use as part of your animal encounter business.</p>

<h2>Zoos and aquariums</h2>

<p>Zoos and aquariums can only keep listed invasive alien animals if they’re used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘ex-situ conservation’ (caring for animals outside their natural habitat under controlled conditions)</li>
  <li>research</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/invasive-alien-species-permit-application">permit from <abbr title="Animal Plant and Health Authority">APHA</abbr></a> to keep these animals for either of these 2 reasons.</p>

<p>In your application, you’ll need to show how you plan to use the species for research or conservation.</p>

<p>Include a full stock list of the invasive alien animal species  in your collection when you apply.</p>

<p>You must prevent breeding. You do not have to sterilise an invasive alien animal although you might choose to do this as a way of preventing breeding.</p>

<h3>Identifying animals</h3>

<p>You must mark or identify the listed animal using methods that do not hurt the animal.</p>

<p>You should microchip the animals. If you cannot microchip an animal, use ringing or shell marking instead.</p>

<h3>Moving between zoos</h3>
<p>You can transfer these animals between different zoos. Both zoos will need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/invasive-alien-species-permit-application?">permit</a> in place before transferring the animal.</p>

<p>The sending zoo will need a permit for transport.</p>

<p>The receiving zoo will need a permit for keeping.</p>

<h3>Sending to a zoo abroad</h3>
<p>If you’re sending an animal to a zoo outside the UK, contact the importing country before you export.</p>

<p>They may have their own permitting rules you’ll need to follow. They may also refuse the consignment.</p>

<p>If they do allow you to export to their country, apply to <abbr title="Animal Plant and Health Authority">APHA</abbr> for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/invasive-alien-species-permit-application">permit</a> to transport it.</p>

<h3>Using invasive alien species as feed</h3>

<p>If you currently use listed species as feed, such as crayfish,you can continue to do this but the species must be bought and transported as a dead feed.</p>

<p>You must not buy live crayfish. If your zoo animals need a live feed, you’ll need to find a different and unlisted species to use as a live feed.</p>

<h2>Research or educational establishments</h2>

<p>If you’re a university or college that keeps these species, you’ll need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/invasive-alien-species-permit-application">permit</a> from <abbr title="Animal Plant and Health Authority">APHA</abbr>. You should apply under the research category.</p>

<p>Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="#research">same rules as zoos</a> when keeping or moving your animals.</p>

<h2>Crayfish trappers and fishing</h2>

<p>There are 5 species of crayfish and 1 species of crab that are listed as alien invasive animal species.</p>

<h3>Authorisation to trap</h3>

<p>You need <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/permission-to-trap-crayfish-eels-elvers-salmon-and-sea-trout#:~:text=see%20call%20charges">authorisation</a> to put a trap in the water to catch crayfish.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got authorisation, you can take specimens that you killed on the riverbank away. For example, for consumption at home.</p>

<p>You must not take live specimens away from the riverbank. You must kill them where you caught them. However, there are 2 exceptions to this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/invasive-alien-species-licence-to-manage-and-control-them-ias-a02">licence</a>, for example, to keep live crayfish for commercial processing on your premises in England</li>
  <li>if you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/invasive-alien-species-permit-application">permit to keep live specimens for research or conservation</a> in England and Wales</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bycatch (accidental capture)</h3>

<p>If you accidentally catch a listed invasive alien crayfish or crab, and can humanely kill it, you should do so. You must not take it home live.</p>

<p>If you cannot kill it humanely, you can release it immediately back where you caught it. Report when you’ve done this on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nonnativespecies.org/index.cfm?sectionid=81" rel="external">IRecord</a> so it can be logged and added to national databases to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>protect endangered native species</li>
  <li>be used in management activities</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not return listed species caught as bycatch to any other place than where you caught it.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure if it’s a listed invasive alien species of crayfish or crab, you should return it alive to the place you caught it. This is so you do not accidentally kill native endangered species instead.</p>

<p>Again, you must not return it to any other place than where you caught it.</p>

<h2>Permits</h2>

<p>You can get a permit for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>research</li>
  <li>‘ex situ conservation’ (caring for animals outside their natural habitat under controlled conditions)</li>
  <li>scientific production (for use of these species in medicinal products for advancement of human health)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only get a permit if you’re working in an enclosed environment, such as a zoo or research establishment.</p>
