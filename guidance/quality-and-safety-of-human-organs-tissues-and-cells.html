<h2>Quality and safety standards for organs, tissues and cells</h2>

<p>You should work to the same quality and safety standards as before 1 January 2021. The government made legislation to ensure the United Kingdom (UK) retained the same quality and safety standards after the end of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">Brexit transition period</a> on 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>For further information on the quality and safety standards you should ask the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) or the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).</p>

<h2>Sending and receiving non-reproductive tissues and cells for human use if you are a tissue establishment in Great Britain</h2>

<p>You should treat suppliers outside the UK as third country suppliers. This means if you import or export non-reproductive tissues or cells from or to a country outside the UK, you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an import or export licence</li>
  <li>for import, an import agreement with the third country supplier</li>
</ul>

<p>For import from and export to suppliers in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">European Economic Area</a> (EEA) you have until 1 July 2021 to put these measures in place.</p>

<p>You should treat the movement of non-reproductive tissues and cells from suppliers in Northern Ireland the same as the movement of non-reproductive tissues and cells from suppliers in Great Britain.</p>

<p>If you require further information, <a rel="external" href="https://www.hta.gov.uk/importing-and-exporting-tissues-and-cells-human-application-1-july-2021-if-you-are-establishment" class="govuk-link">visit the HTA website</a> for detailed guidance on import and export arrangements. You can also <a rel="external" href="https://www.hta.gov.uk/make_an_enquiry" class="govuk-link">contact them directly</a> for advice.</p>

<h2>Sending and receiving non-reproductive tissues and cells for human use if you are a tissue establishment in Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>You should treat suppliers in Great Britain in accordance with the relevant European Union (EU) regulations on non-EU suppliers. This means if you receive non-reproductive tissues or cells from Great Britain, you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an import licence</li>
  <li>an import agreement with the supplier in Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>In line with the UK government's commitment to unfettered access, there are no additional requirements to send non-reproductive tissues or cells to Great Britain.</p>

<p>There are no additional requirements to send or receive tissues or cells to or from the EEA.</p>

<p>If you require further information, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hta.gov.uk/importing-tissues-and-cells-human-application-if-you-are-establishment-northern-ireland">visit the HTA website</a> for detailed guidance on import and export arrangements. You can also <a rel="external" href="https://www.hta.gov.uk/make_an_enquiry" class="govuk-link">contact them directly</a> for advice.</p>

<h2>Sending and receiving reproductive tissues and cells for human use if you are a centre in Great Britain licenced by the HFEA</h2>

<p>You should treat suppliers outside the UK as third country suppliers. This means if you import reproductive tissues or cells from a country outside the UK, you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an import certificate authorising imports from the third country supplier</li>
  <li>if multiple imports are to be undertaken, an import agreement with the third country supplier</li>
</ul>

<p>For import from suppliers in the EEA you have until 1 July 2021 to put these measures in place.</p>

<p>You should treat the movement of non-reproductive tissues and cells from Northern Ireland the same as the movement of non-reproductive tissues and cells from Great Britain.</p>

<p>If you require further information, you should ask the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hfea.gov.uk/contact-us">HFEA</a> for detailed guidance on the requirements you need to meet.</p>

<h2>Ensuring traceability of all tissues and cells</h2>

<p>If you are a tissue establishment or fertility clinic in Great Britain, you must continue to ensure the traceability of tissues and cells (including reproductive cells). You no longer need to use the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/blood_tissues_organs/tissues/single_european_code_en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Single European Code</a>, unless you wish to do so. You can use the traceability systems you had in place before the introduction of the Single European Code.</p>

<p>If you are a tissue establishment or fertility clinic in Northern Ireland, you must continue to use the Single European Code.</p>

<h2>Declaring substances of human origin (blood, organs, tissues and cells) for UK import or export</h2>

<p>See the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/declare-substances-of-human-origin-for-transplant-for-uk-import-or-export">guidance on import or export declarations for human organs, blood, tissues and cells needed for emergency use</a>.</p>
