<p>See <a title="moving or retiring abroad" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<h2>Visas</h2>
<p>You may enter and visit the Philippines for up to 30 days without a visa if you hold valid tickets for your return or onward journey, and your passport is valid for the proposed duration of your stay.</p>

<p>Due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Philippine government has announced temporary entry restrictions. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/philippines/entry-requirements" title="entry requirements">entry requirements</a> in our travel advice.</p>

<p>If you need to apply for a visa before travelling to the Philippines, contact your nearest <a title="Philippine Embassy" href="https://dfa.gov.ph/office-of-protocol/foreign-embassies" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Philippine Embassy</a>.</p>

<p>If you are already in the Philippines, contact the <a rel="external" href="https://www.immigration.gov.ph" class="govuk-link" title="Bureau of Immigration">Bureau of Immigration</a> with all visa and immigration issues.</p>

<ul>
  <li>24/7 Hotline: +63 (02) 465-2400</li>
  <li>Landline: +63 (02) 524-3769</li>
  <li>Email:  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:immigPH@gmail.com">immigPH@gmail.com</a>, <a href="mailto:xinfo@immigration.gov.ph" class="govuk-link">xinfo@immigration.gov.ph</a>

</li>
</ul>

<p>You risk a heavy fine, detention and other severe penalties if you overstay your visa.</p>

<p>All registered foreign nationals are required to report in person to the Bureau of Immigration and its offices within the first sixty (60) days of every calendar year. Please visit the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" title="Bureau of Immigration" href="http://www.immigration.gov.ph/">Bureau of Immigration</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Health</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/philippines/health" title="health" class="govuk-link">health</a> in our travel advice.</p>

<p>The Philippines and the UK do not have reciprocal healthcare agreements. You may visit the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/" title="National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)" rel="external" class="govuk-link">National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC)</a> for useful information about healthcare if youâ€™re planning to visit or move to another country.</p>

<p>See also the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-support-for-when-you-are-unable-to-return-to-the-uk-during-coronavirus-covid-19" title="guidance on healthcare if youâ€™re waiting to return to the UK" class="govuk-link">guidance on healthcare if youâ€™re waiting to return to the UK</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure to buy comprehensive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance" title="travel and medical insurance">travel and medical insurance</a> that includes coverage for full hospital admission, air ambulance, medical evacuation for you and your family, and repatriation in the event of death.</p>

<p>The availability of medical care varies across the Philippines, and may not meet the standards of care in the UK. Although adequate in major cities, medical care is limited in more remote areas, and treatment can be very expensive. Make sure to have adequate funds to cover full medical expenses in the absence of a travel and medical insurance.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.philhealth.gov.ph/news/2017/expands_coverage.html" title="Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth)" rel="external">Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth)</a> for advice on qualification for social health insurance benefits.</p>

<p>Most private hospitals in the Philippines have an international liaison department with English-speaking staff who will assist patients, their relatives and insurance companies. See our <a title="list of medical facilities in the Philippines" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/philippines-list-of-medical-facilities">list of medical facilities in the Philippines</a>.</p>

<p>If you need emergency medical assistance during your trip, dial 911 and ask for an ambulance. You should contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you are referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>

<p>If you are hospitalised in the Philippines, the British Embassy can contact the hospital to check on your progress and whenever possible, visit you within 24 hours after notification of hospitalisation. We can also contact your family or friends in the UK through the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in London.</p>

<p>If you are suffering from mental illness, we will do our best to help you find the support and advice wherever you are.

<h3>Guidance on bringing medication into the Philippines</h3>

<p>Penalties for importing and using illegal drugs are severe. Do not carry anything through customs for someone else unless you know exactly what it contains.

<p>If you need to obtain prescribed medication at a local pharmacy, you should present your original prescription or a letter from your doctor outlining your medical condition, the prescribed medicine and recommended dosage. Please consult with your GP or seek medical advice if you are running low on supplies.</p>

<h2>Driving in the Philippines</h2>
<p>Vehicles in the Philippines drive on the right side of the road and cars have the steering wheel on the left-hand side.</p>

<p>You should always carry a local driving licence or international driving permit if you plan to drive in the Philippines. See <a rel="external" title="Land Transportation Office (LTO)" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lto.gov.ph/">Land Transportation Office (LTO)</a> for advice.</p>

<p>Philippine law prohibits children aged aged 12 or below from using the fornt seat of a vehicle. A child may be exempted provided they are at least 150cm tall (4â€™11â€™â€™) provided they can be properly secured using a regular seatbelt. Otherwise, children must sit in the back of the vehicle and use a child restraint system or car seat. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in a penalty.</p>

<h2>Finance</h2>
<p>The currency in the Philippines is the peso (PHP).</p>

<p>Some ATMs accept international credit and debit cards. Shops in towns and cities usually accept international credit cards. Banks do not always accept travellersâ€™ cheques. Cash in sterling or US dollars can be exchanged for Philippine pesos at the airport, in banks, hotels and some shops. Scottish and Northern Ireland bank notes arenâ€™t generally accepted. Buying foreign currency in the Philippines can be difficult.</p>
