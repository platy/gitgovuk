<p>Royal Mail Group (RMG) is the UK’s designated Universal Postal Union Provider.</p>

<p>An express carrier is a company that delivers parcels (express consignments) within a set timeframe, offering a door to door collection and delivery service. It may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>express couriers</li>
  <li>fast parcel operators</li>
  <li>freight forwarders</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>While discussions continue on the proposals in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1008451/CCS207_CCS0721914902-005_Northern_Ireland_Protocol_Web_Accessible__1_.pdf" rel="external">the Northern Ireland Protocol: the way forward</a>, you should continue to use the current arrangements. We’ll update this guidance in due course and give you time to prepare for any new requirements.</p>
</div>

<h2>Temporary arrangements for moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>HMRC has adopted a temporary approach to applying declaration requirements for the movement of goods in parcels (including by the Royal Mail Group and express carriers).</p>

<p>The temporary approach recognises the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, the impacts of any disruption to parcel movements in the context of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and specific challenges for operators moving parcels. This guidance sets out the detail of this approach.</p>

<p>In almost all cases, goods sent to consumers will not require a customs declaration.</p>

<p>Declarations will only usually be required where the goods are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#goods-prohibited">prohibited or restricted</a></li>
  <li>being sent from a business to another business where the value of the good is greater than £135</li>
</ul>

<p>The controls and requirements that apply during the temporary approach period are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>controls through the Goods Vehicle Movement Service</li>
  <li>inventory systems at ports</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accounting-for-vat-on-goods-moving-between-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-from-1-january-2021">VAT requirements</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Northern Ireland residents receiving goods from Great Britain</h3>

<p>If you’re a Northern Ireland resident consumer, you can continue to receive goods from Great Britain with no new requirements.</p>

<h3>Individuals in Great Britain sending goods to Northern Ireland residents and businesses</h3>

<p>You can continue to send goods in parcels to Northern Ireland residents and businesses in the same way you did before 1 January  2021. For example by using a Post Office, express service point or returning goods to businesses.</p>

<p>You can continue to send goods in parcels to businesses (such as returned goods) as you usually do with no new requirements.</p>

<h3>Northern Ireland businesses receiving goods from a business in Great Britain valued over £135</h3>

<p>If you’re a Northern Ireland based business receiving goods valued over £135 through the Royal Mail Group or an express carrier you’ll have to submit a declaration. However, you can delay when you do this and you’ll be able to use the free Trader Support Service (<abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr>) to do so.</p>

<p>You should speak to the <abbr title="Trader Support Service">TSS</abbr> on when and how to make this declaration, and further details on how you’ll be able to submit this delayed declaration will be issued in due course.</p>

<p>You should prepare by:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trader-support-service">registering with the Trader Support Service</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eori">registering for an EORI number</a></li>
  <li>storing an invoice for the goods you received, including the date that they were received</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also take steps to avoid the risk of needing to pay tariffs unnecessarily on these goods when you submit your declarations. You’ll need to keep additional records dependent on the tariff removal route appropriate:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You could consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-authorisation-for-the-uk-trader-scheme-if-you-bring-goods-into-northern-ireland">applying to join the UK Trader Scheme</a> to become authorised to declare goods ‘not at risk’. You’ll need to meet certain criteria to do this, including being able to demonstrate the end use of the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof that the goods meet Rules of Origin to benefit from zero tariffs under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence that you’re within your de minimis State Aid allowance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Dependent on your contractual arrangement with the Great Britain sending business, they may complete the delayed declaration instead of you.</p>

<h3>Northern Ireland businesses receiving goods from a business in Great Britain valued at £135 or less</h3>

<p>If the goods you’re receiving in a parcel have a value of £135 or less, then you can continue to receive these goods from Great Britain as usual with no new requirements. A declaration is not required for these goods.</p>

<h3>Businesses in Great Britain sending excise goods to Northern Ireland residents and businesses</h3>

<p>The temporary approach to declaration requirements now also includes excise goods that are already UK duty paid. This means that for as long as the temporary arrangements are in place, businesses sending excise duty paid goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland by RMG or an express carrier, do not need to make a customs declaration.</p>

<p>There is still a liability to excise duty on arrival in Northern Ireland but you can offset this against the duty already paid in Great Britain. In the limited circumstances where the duty already paid is less than the liability, you’ll have to account for the duty.  However, you’ll not need to pay an additional excise duty until the end of the temporary arrangements. You should keep records to be able to account for any excise duty at the end of the temporary arrangements as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records">Excise Notice 206</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll publish further guidance on what businesses need to do to account for additional excise duty before the end of the temporary arrangements.</p>

<h3>Northern Ireland businesses receiving excise goods from a business in Great Britain valued over £135</h3>

<p>If you’re a business based in Northern Ireland receiving excise goods valued over £135 from a business in Great Britain, you’ll have to submit a declaration in line with the arrangements for other goods set out above.</p>

<h3>Businesses in Great Britain sending prohibited and restricted goods to Northern Ireland residents and businesses</h3>

<p>If you’re sending <a class="govuk-link" href="#goods-prohibited">prohibited and restricted goods</a> in parcels, you should inform the Royal Mail Group or your express carrier as a customs declaration will need to be made.</p>

<p>Your carrier will be able to tell you if they carry the type of goods you want to send. They may ask you to provide additional information or to take additional steps that you need to take so that a declaration can be made. It is your responsibility to comply with any licensing or reporting requirements for the goods that you’re moving.</p>

<p>The details you give the Royal Mail Group or an express carrier about your consignment (including sender and recipients details) may be disclosed to HMRC and Border Force to support customs compliance.</p>

<h2>Goods with restrictions in place</h2>

<p>The following list of prohibited and restricted goods include additional steps which are needed for sending parcels from Great Britain to Northern Ireland consumers.</p>

<p>Restricted goods require a customs declaration and specific steps before being moved. Prohibited goods cannot be moved. Find links below to relevant guidance on moving these items, along with more detail on specific cases relevant to parcel movements.</p>

<h4>Agri-foods, live animals, plants and seeds</h4>

<p>Agri-foods, live animals, plants, plant products and seeds subject to a range of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) controls which may include certification requirements, checks at points of entry and prohibitions and restrictions.
Categories of agri-foods products commonly sent in parcels include pet food, as well as food products, for consumption by humans. Live animals cannot be sent to Northern Ireland by parcel, as they must be presented at an appropriately designated point of entry.

<p>Certain food, drink and feed products are exempt from certification or inspection at a point of entry. Products falling into these categories and commonly sent in parcels include certain types of confectionery, wine (<a class="govuk-link" href="#wine">where below 100l</a>), chocolate and cakes. These would not require a customs declaration either.

<p>Certain products containing animal or plant products such as fruit and vegetables that have been processed and packaged to the point that they no longer pose a biosecurity risk, are exempt from Sanitary and Phytosanitary controls. These include most clothing products and certain processed plant products. These would also not require a customs declaration.</p>

<p>If you have any specific questions on moving goods subject to regulatory controls, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/movement-assistance-scheme-get-help-with-moving-agrifood-goods-to-northern-ireland">read the Movement Assistance Scheme guidance</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-defra">contact the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)</a>.</p>
