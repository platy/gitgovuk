<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Germany to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings.</p>

<p>These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>The German authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa/who-needs-a-visa" rel="external">German government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.
If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Germany. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with the German authorities or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Germany, so you know which ones to use when speaking to the German authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Germany for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>going to court as a witness</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs</li>
  <li>board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers, including entertainment such as eating at a restaurant</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>fact-finding visits</li>
  <li>negotiating deals or contracts</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference, as long as you’re not being paid</li>
  <li>studying for up to 90 days in a rolling 180-day period</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
  <li>leisure travel such as holidays or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>Or for the following types of training, so long as it’s for the same company or group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>classroom-based training</li>
  <li>on-the-job training</li>
  <li>shadowing someone’s job</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter explaining your trip, or a plan for any training you’ll be doing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Germany’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<h3>Exempt for 90 days in 12 months</h3>

<p>These don’t require a visa or permit in Germany if they’re for less than 90 days in a 12-month period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>academic staff, such as scientists, technicians, engineers or language teachers working at research or higher education institutions (doesn’t include researchers at accredited research institutions)</li>
  <li>teachers working at state or approved private schools</li>
  <li>internships, if you meet legal requirements – check these with the German authorities</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_beschv/englisch_beschv.html#p0143" rel="external">journalists employed in the UK</a></li>
  <li>fashion models</li>
  <li>installing software or machinery, or completing technical maintenance, repairs and training – your employer must submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/en/welcome" rel="external">notification to the German Federal Employment Agency</a> before you start working</li>
  <li>travel guides who accompany tourist groups to Germany – you must keep your regular place of residence in the UK</li>
  <li>translators who need to take part in meetings and discussions in Germany – you must keep your regular place of residence in the UK</li>
  <li>international rail and road traffic industry workers – including drivers who collect and unload deliveries, bus or coach drivers, train operators, train service staff and attendants</li>
  <li>professional drivers – you must be able to show you have the correct driving qualifications and get approval first from the authorities</li>
  <li>sea and air transportation workers, such as international ship crew, sea pilots, technical staff, passenger service staff and plane crew – pilots, engineers and navigators employed by German companies will need a work permit</li>
  <li>speaking or performing in science, the arts, entertainment or sports of special interest (performers and their assistants – you must keep your regular place of residence in the UK – you may be able to get approval to stay longer than 90 days</li>
  <li>working in special cultural or musical events, or in the film and television industry – you may be able to get approval to stay longer than 90 days</li>
  <li>working in a recognised voluntary position or carrying out charitable or religious work</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, sport and e-sport professionals and trainers working for a German sports organisation or taking part in German competitions with these conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you must be over 16</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sport organisation must pay at least 50% of the minimum contribution to pensions insurance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the German national association for your sport must recognise your qualifications</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Exempt for 90 days in 180 days</h3>

<p>Directors, board members and business leaders are exempt for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. For more than 90 days you need a long-term work permit from the first day of work.</p>

<p>If you have an EU intra-company transfer permit (EU ICT) from another country you can work in Germany for 90 days in a 180-day period. Your employer has to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/EN/MigrationAufenthalt/ICTKarte/anleitung-unternehmen-ict.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4" rel="external">notify the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF)</a>.</p>

<p>All the exemptions are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>employment confirmation</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">German embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit, but you must check the exact rules and processes with the German <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a> or immigration authorities.</p>

<p>Usually, you should apply for a national D visa so you can start working. You then apply for a longer-term residence permit once in Germany.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>You may be able to apply for dependant permits if you have a family and want them to join you. It depends on the type of work permit you have.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/living-in-germany/family-reunification/spouses-non-eu-countries" rel="external">taking your family with you</a>.</p>

<h3>Long-term visas and permits</h3>

<p>Germany only offers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa/kinds-of-visa/work-qualified-professionals" rel="external">long-term visas and permits for work</a>. They are valid for up to 4 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<p>You must apply for one if your profession isn’t exempt or you’re in Germany because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring to a German branch of a UK-based company (intra-corporate transfer), even if it’s for a short period of time</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a German company on a German employment contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#nations">providing services to a client in Germany</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">providing services as a self-employed worker or setting up a business</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research work</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Transferring to a German branch of a UK-based company</h2>

<p>You need one of these permits if your UK-based company moves you to a German branch to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#exchange">international staff exchange programme</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ICT">EU intra-company transfer permit (EU ICT)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>International staff exchange</h3>
<p>If you need to work at a German branch temporarily, your employer can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/unternehmen/arbeitskraefte/internationaler-personalaustausch" rel="external">international staff exchange</a>.</p>

<p>To qualify your employer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be registered with the personnel exchange department of the German labour office</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have a branch in Germany and exchange staff with their offices in other countries</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have at least a bachelor’s level degree</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep your UK employment contract</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stay on UK payroll</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The international staff exchange permit takes 8 to 12 weeks to get. It’s valid for up to 3 years and can’t be extended.</p>

<p>If you have a family they can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/living-in-germany/family-reunification/spouses-non-eu-countries" rel="external">join you as dependants</a>.</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>You need to check with the German authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Your employer submits a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/migration/feg-anwendungshinweise-anlagen/anlage2.pdf;jsessionid=1BF8F7FF9C82B956E37790EB866D44B0.1_cid287?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=5" rel="external">work permit application</a> for pre-approval from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/unternehmen/arbeitskraefte/beschaeftigung-beantragen" rel="external">Federal Employment Agency</a>. This speeds up the process. You can also apply directly at the embassy or immigration office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa/applying/application-forms" rel="external">national D visa application</a> with the necessary documents to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://uk.diplo.de/uk-en" rel="external">German embassy</a>. You can also submit it directly at the immigration office in Germany, but won’t be able to start working until you have your final residence permit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You register your address at the local city hall within 14 days of arriving in Germany, if staying for more than 3 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You submit a residence permit application at your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/living-in-germany/advisory/german-states?tx_vcmaps_pi1%5Baction%5D=&amp;tx_vcmaps_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=Pi1&amp;cHash=4884782e205d430a052d50b2453c31a2" rel="external">local immigration office</a> – check with them which forms and documents you need. You only need to do this if you’re staying in Germany after your national D visa expiry date.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Application documents</h4>

<p>German authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed permit application form</li>
  <li>passport for you and any dependants – valid for 6 months, less than 10 years old, and with at least 2 blank pages</li>
  <li>degree or qualification certificate relevant to the job</li>
  <li>CV</li>
  <li>job description</li>
  <li>signed assignment agreement with your employer</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostilled)</a> birth certificate for any children</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostilled)</a>  marriage certificate, if married
health insurance cover in Germany for you and any dependants</li>
  <li>proof of residence in Germany, including signed confirmation from the landlord (required once you get to Germany)</li>
