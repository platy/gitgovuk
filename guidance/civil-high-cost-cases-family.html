<h2>When a case becomes high cost</h2>

<p>A case becomes high cost when the costs are likely to exceed £25,000.</p>

<p>There are 2 teams managing high cost family cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very High Cost Case (VHCC) family team (South Tyneside) - deals with all single and KC/2 counsel/advocate cases in private and public law family matters</li>
  <li>Exceptional and Complex Case Team (ECCT) family section (London) - deals with all prior authority requests for KC/2 counsel cases in private and public law family matters and all  Court of Protection cases. ECCT provides all technical oversight and support to VHCC</li>
</ul>

<p>All family cases requiring KC or 2 Counsel will require Prior Authority.  These should be submitted as an Amendment via CCMS (or APP8 if the case is not being run on CCMS).  All requests for prior authority must address sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the Narrative and Guidance: Legal Aid.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/737505/Guidance_on_authorities_and_legal_aid_for_cases_in_courts_outside_England_and_Wales_August_2018_clean_copy.pdf" rel="external">Guidance on authorities and legal aid for cases in courts outside England and Wales</a></p>

<p>You’ll find general guidance on high cost family cases in the <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1105889/1._hcf_family_overview_pack_v7.pdf">Family overview pack</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">404 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">12 pages</span>)</span>.</p>

<p>There are 2 main methods of costing these high cost family cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Care Case Fee Schemes (CCFS).
Some private law and other child cases which follow a similar fact-finding route and have main hearings over 10 days may qualify for the CCFS scheme (on request and agreed by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA)</li>
  <li>Detailed (fully costed) case plans used in all other family cases plus care cases that the LAA deem to be exceptional</li>
</ul>

<h2>Care Case Fee Schemes</h2>

<h3>Overview of CCFS</h3>

<p>The CCFS model simplifies case planning. Costs are determined by reference to events (as defined in the Information Packs), which have a set value. There are two variations depending on whether the case is being run with single counsel/ solicitor advocate or Two/ Leading Counsel.</p>

<h3>Single Counsel CCFS cases</h3>

<p>Upon notifying the LAA that a case is high cost and you confirm the case will be costed using CCFS you will be asked to upload onto CCMS signed High Cost Contract and Counsel Acceptance Forms (where external advocate/s are to seek their fees outside of the Family Advocacy Scheme). At the same time, you should submit a cost amendment for £32,500. This will allow you to immediately access cash flow. You must ensure that if counsel is used they are assigned to the case and allocated appropriate funds.</p>

<p>The Information Pack below explains the details of the CCFS. The completed example case plan below will help you fill in the template.</p>

<p><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1081002/2._HCF_1_Counsel_Care_Case_Fee_Scheme_Information_Pack_v6.pdf">CCFS Information Pack (June 2019)</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">750 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">25 pages</span>)</span></p>

<p>The following is a flow and text based flow chart summarising the planning process.</p>

<p>It covers the route used in CCMS for registration as a High Cost Case, the planning process, contract upload, and  cost amendments - all the way through to submission of final bills for payment.</p>

<p>A full step-by-step interactive training module has been created demonstrating the process on CCMS.  Please click <a class="govuk-link" href="http://ccmstraining.justice.gov.uk/training-resources/interactive-training-modules" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>The CCMS Quick Guides are also available <a class="govuk-link" href="http://ccmstraining.justice.gov.uk/Quick-guides" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to submit an Interim CCFS Form to obtain costs beyond £32,500, submit the CCFS Form without any supporting documentation. Make sure the CCFS Form is fully completed to avoid unnecessary queries. At the conclusion of the case Providers should submit their Final CCFS Form accompanied by a checklist of required information, which will help us reach agreement on final costs. It is important that all documentation requested is provided to avoid delay and re-submission. Counsel Acceptance Forms for all external advocates acting outside of FAS should also be uploaded at this final submission stage to allow counsel to present their bills.</p>

<h3>KC/2 Counsel CCFS cases</h3>

<p>Upon grant of Prior Authority for KC/2 Counsel you will be asked to upload onto CCMS signed High Cost Contract and Counsel Acceptance Forms (where external advocate/s  are to seek their fees outside of the Family Advocacy Scheme) if you accept the case will be costed using CCFS. At the same time, you should submit a cost amendment for £60,000, where the authority covers a fact finding hearing or composite final hearing. Make sure that if counsel is used they are assigned to the case and allocated appropriate funds.</p>

<h2>Detailed (fully costed) family case plans</h2>

<h3>Exceptional Care Cases</h3>

<p>All single counsel/ solicitor advocate care cases will be paid via CCFS.  If a case is considered to be exceptional such that the costs that would be payable under CCFS would not properly remunerate, application may be made at the point of notification that the case is high cost for a detailed case plan to be submitted.</p>

<p>When notifying the LAA that your case is high cost you may find it helpful to use this <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1080994/16._hcf_notification_template_2.docx">template</a> (<span class="type">MS Word Document</span>, <span class="file-size">20.2 KB</span>)</span>. This will help you to include all relevant information and avoid delay that may be caused by LAA requests for further information.</p>

<p>The criteria for a case to be treated as exceptional are set out in the Information Pack below. In all family cases where CCFS does not apply, a detailed case plan is required at the point of notification that the case is high cost.</p>

<p>These plans set out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>description of the case</li>
  <li>assessment of its prospects</li>
  <li>legal and factual issues to be investigated and resolved</li>
  <li>details of costs</li>
  <li>the selection of counsel and experts used</li>
</ul>

<h2>Counsel Fees</h2>

<p>Fees payable to counsel in family cases under CCFS (both single counsel and 2 counsel) and under a detailed case plan are set out in <span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1105898/22._hcf_payments_to_counsel.pdf">Payments to counsel</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">803 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">5 pages</span>)</span>.</p>

<p>Where counsel’s fees are calculated on an equivalent basis as FGF and  have been requested to supply counsel fees costed using the Family Graduated Fee Scheme as a guide you will need to upload a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/738739/civclaim5-version-13-September-2018.pdf" rel="external">Claim 5</a>. Please note this is just a document to support the case plan and it is not an actual bill on CCMS. We have developed an FGF fees calculator below, which will assist you in completing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/738739/civclaim5-version-13-September-2018.pdf" rel="external">Claim 5</a> by calculating costs that would be equivalent to the costs that would have been payable under the FGF Scheme.</p>
