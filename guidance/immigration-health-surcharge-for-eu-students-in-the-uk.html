<h2>About the <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you begin a course of study in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> that is longer than 6 months, you must pay the immigration health surcharge (<abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr>) as part of your visa application.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application">paying for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> healthcare as part of your immigration application</a>.</p>

<p>If your course of study is 6 months or less, you do not need to pay the <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement for students</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2022, you can apply to get back the money you paid for the <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr>. This is called an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you get a reimbursement, you will not be able to get as much free healthcare in the UK. You should carefully consider all the information on this page before deciding whether to apply for a reimbursement.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you’ve received a reimbursement, you must present your European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) in order to get urgent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/visiting-or-moving-to-england/visitors-from-eu-countries-norway-iceland-liechtenstein-or-switzerland/" rel="external">medically necessarily healthcare</a> in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> during the period covered. You may be charged for state healthcare if it is not considered medically necessary.</p>

<p>You cannot repay the reimbursement if you change your mind or your circumstances change.</p>

<p>If you’re a student from the EU, your reimbursement will be backdated to include any surcharge payments made for a visa starting on or after 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you’re a student from Switzerland, your reimbursement will be backdated from 1 November 2021 even if your visa started earlier.</p>

<h3>Who can apply</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to a full or partial reimbursement of your <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> payment if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re a full-time student in <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> higher education</li>
  <li>your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> visa started on or after 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>you have a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) issued from an EU country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>you do not work or do not intend to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Higher education is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>level 4 and above in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>level 7 and above in Scotland</li>
</ul>

<p>Your family members, including your spouse, civil partner and dependent children, can also get an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on a visa that started on or after 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>hold a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>do not work and do not intend to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only make an application if you’re the student eligible for reimbursement.</p>

<p>You can apply for family members as part of your application. If a family member needs to make a separate application – for example, because they arrive in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> at a later date – they should contact the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Business Services Authority by email at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:nhsbsa.faregistrationsohs@nhs.net">nhsbsa.faregistrationsohs@nhs.net</a>.</p>

<h3>How much <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement you’ll get</h3>

<p>To get a full <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement, make sure that your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is valid for the length of your visa. If your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> only covers part of your stay in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, you’ll receive a partial reimbursement.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> does not cover the whole of your stay, you can make an application for the amount of <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> covered by your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. If you renew your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, you can then apply for a further reimbursement. To make your first application, you must have had at least 6 months left on your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> when your visa started.</p>

<p>You may not be able to get an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement for any periods in which you didn’t have a valid <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>The application takes about 30 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>To make an application, you need your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name as it appears on your passport</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>9-digit <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> number, which you can find in your confirmation email from WorldPay – the number starts with ‘<abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr>’, for example, IHS123456789</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status">visa share code</a> – this code lets you prove your visa status to others</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> address</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>scanned copy or photo of your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=559&amp;langId=en" rel="external">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>scanned copy or photo of your Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) statement or university acceptance letter</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also need all of the same details for any family members you’re applying for.</p>

<p>The type of visa you are on does not affect your eligibility for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>However, it’s possible that your country may not consider your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to be valid if you move to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on certain types of visa – for example, as a dependent of another visa holder.</p>

<p>If you apply to the scheme and you’re not on a student visa, you’ll need to show evidence that your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> is still valid. For example, this could be confirmation from your country’s health authority.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-student-immigration-health-surcharge-refund">Start the application on this page</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Answer the questions. Upload scans or photos of documents as evidence to support your application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete and submit your application. Then we’ll send you an email with your application reference number to confirm that you’ve applied.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Deadlines for applying</h3>

<p>If you arrived in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021, you must apply for a repayment reimbursement by 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>If you arrive in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from 1 January 2022, you’ll have a year to apply from the start date of your visa.</p>

<p>You should apply for your reimbursement as soon as possible after arriving in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. This will help you to have all the relevant documents you need to make an application. It also means we can give you important information about using your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to get medical treatment.</p>

<h3>After you apply</h3>

<p>We’ll send you an email to let you know if we’ll repay your <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> or not.</p>

<p>We’ll pay the money back to the original payment card or bank account used to pay the <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> fee. If someone else paid the <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> for you (such as your university), we’ll repay the money to their bank account.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You cannot repay the reimbursement if you change your mind or your circumstances change. You should carefully consider all the information on this page before deciding whether to apply for a reimbursement.</p>
</div>

<h2>If you work or plan to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h2>

<p>A student is only eligible for an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement if they do not work during the time the <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> covers.</p>

<p>You need to carefully consider whether you intend to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> before deciding whether to apply for a reimbursement.</p>

<p>This is because, if you work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will no longer be valid as your home country will no longer be responsible for your healthcare while you’re in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>When applying for the student <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement scheme, you’ll be asked to declare if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>currently work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have worked in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> during your visa period</li>
  <li>intend to work in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> during your visa period</li>
</ul>

<p>If you declare any of these, you will not be able to apply for an&nbsp;<abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr>&nbsp;reimbursement.</p>

<p>Answering ‘yes’ does not affect your right to work under the conditions of your visa – only your eligibility for an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement.</p>

<p>If you start work after getting an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement, you’ll need to contact the health authority in your home country to confirm what healthcare you are covered for and consider buying insurance to cover any additional healthcare you may need.</p>

<h3>What counts as ‘work’</h3>

<p>‘Work’ is defined as any paid employment or self-employment that is liable for National Insurance.</p>

<p>This includes any work where the minimum earnings threshold for owing National Insurance is not met.</p>

<p>If you have a contract of employment with your university (for example, as a PhD student to teach), this will count as work.</p>

<h3>What does not count as work</h3>

<p>You can apply for an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do unpaid work (including unpaid work placements)</li>
  <li>volunteer</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also apply for an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement if you get scholarship income (such as a bursary). This income is not considered taxable income.</p>

<h2>Accessing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> healthcare during your studies</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You should carefully consider your healthcare needs before deciding whether to apply for an IHS reimbursement.</p>
</div>

<h3>Accessing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> healthcare when you’ve paid the <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> entitles you to free <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> hospital treatment in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on the same basis as someone who is ordinarily resident (except for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded assisted conception services in England).</p>

<p>You can access treatment from the date your visa is granted until it expires.</p>

<p>For more information about accessing <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> services in different parts of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, see:</p>

<h3>Accessing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> healthcare after getting an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement</h3>

<p>If you or your family members get an <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> reimbursement, you can only use your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> to access ‘medically necessary treatment’ during your stay.</p>

<p>Medically necessary treatment means healthcare that cannot reasonably wait until you or your family members return home.</p>

<p>Medically necessary healthcare can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>emergency treatment and visits to <abbr title="accident and emergency">A&amp;E</abbr>
</li>
  <li>treatment for a long-term or pre-existing medical condition</li>
  <li>routine medical care for pre-existing conditions that need monitoring</li>
  <li>routine maternity care, as long as you’re not going abroad to give birth</li>
  <li>oxygen therapy and kidney dialysis</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not a treatment is classed as ‘medically necessary’ can be influenced by the duration of your planned stay in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. For example, if you broke your leg while on holiday you would likely be entitled to an operation to treat your leg. If you’re studying for 6 months in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> with no plans to visit home, you would likely be entitled to the operation as well as any necessary follow-up treatments, such as physiotherapy.</p>

<p>Students will therefore typically be covered on a more comprehensive basis than a tourist under the <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> scheme. However, the decision on whether or not a treatment is medically necessary is always made by the individual healthcare provider.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you intend to apply for a reimbursement, you should show your EU or Swiss EHIC when accessing medically necessary treatment during your stay in the UK.</p>
</div>

<p>You may have to pay for any <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> healthcare you get that is not deemed medically necessary. This includes ‘elective’ treatment such as planned non-urgent surgery that is not covered by <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you need this type of treatment, you may be able to apply to your home country for support under the planned treatment (S2) route.</p>

<p>You should consider buying insurance to cover any healthcare requirements not covered by your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, such as medical repatriation should you become too ill to travel home.</p>
