<p>T Levels are new courses that launched in September 2020. These 2-year courses follow GCSEs and are equivalent to 3 A levels.</p>

<p>T Levels combine classroom theory, practical learning and substantial industry placements (45 days) to make sure students have real experience of the workplace. T Level courses have been developed with employers and businesses so the content meets the needs of industry and prepares students for work.</p>

<p>They are designed to provide the knowledge, skills and experience needed to open the door to entry level skilled roles, a higher apprenticeship or further study including at university.</p>

<h2>Development of T Levels</h2>

<p>Co-creating T Levels with T Level providers and other key delivery partners is crucial to their success. We are incredibly grateful for the commitment of providers and the hard work they have put in to make these qualifications happen.</p>

<h2>T Level Action Plan</h2>

<p>The Department for Education published its latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-action-plan">T Level Action Plan</a> in December 2021. The action plan gives an update on governmentâ€™s progress in reforming technical education as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-16-skills-plan-and-independent-report-on-technical-education">Post-16 skills plan</a>.</p>

<p>This is the 5th T Level Action Plan and includes updates on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the launch of the first ten T Levels in 2020 and 2021 and ongoing preparations for delivery in future years</li>
  <li>the T Levels which will be available for delivery in 2022 and 2023</li>
  <li>eligibility criteria and how providers can register to deliver T Levels from 2023 and beyond; and</li>
  <li>wider qualifications reform work</li>
</ul>

<p>Read an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introduction-of-t-levels">introduction to T Levels</a> for more detail about T Levels.</p>

<h2>T Level Transition Programme</h2>

<p>The T Level Transition Programme provides a high-quality route onto T Levels for students who would benefit from the additional study time and preparation that it will give them before they start their T Level.</p>

<p>We are taking a phased approach to implementing the T Level Transition Programme alongside the introduction of T Levels. We are working closely with a subset of early T Level providers to explore different approaches to delivery, to help determine the shape of the programme what the future national Framework for Delivery should look like.</p>

<p>The providers that are delivering the Transition Programme in 2021 to 2022 and those planning to deliver in 2022 to 2023 are listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providers-selected-to-deliver-t-levels">Providers delivering or planning to deliver the T Level Transition Programme</a>.</p>

<p>See the revised <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-transition-programme-framework-for-delivery-2020-to-2021">T Level Transition Programme Framework for Delivery</a> for information on and expectations for how the programme should be delivered from academic year 2022 onwards.</p>

<h2>Development of the national T Level Transition Programme</h2>

<p>In April 2021 we announced our plans to firm up the programme for implementation from September 2022. This is to ensure a degree of consistency in how students are prepared for a T Level, regardless of where they are studying, whilst retaining the flexibility the programme needs to support each student individually.</p>

<p>We said that we would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set minimum expectations about what students should experience for each element of the programme</li>
  <li>set some outcomes for the technical component and the knowledge, skills and behaviours needed to achieve them</li>
  <li>develop key resources for providers to use in designing and delivering their programmes</li>
  <li>develop a student guide setting out what students can expect from the programme</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this we worked with T Level Transition Programme providers to understand what has worked well over the first year of delivery to help us refine the Framework for Delivery, and with employers and education specialists to put together a set of proposals. Over autumn 2021 we sought the views of a wider group of providers, employers and other stakeholders to help ensure we had captured the right minimum expectations and outcomes that will enable student progression to T Levels.</p>

<p>In December 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-transition-programme-framework-for-delivery-2022-to-2023">we published</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the revised Framework for Delivery</li>
  <li>national technical outcomes for the first 3 waves of T Level routes: Construction; Digital; Education and Childcare (introduced from 2020); Health and Science (introduced from 2021); Business and Administration; Engineering and Manufacturing; Legal, Finance and Accounting (introduced from 2022)</li>
  <li>resources to help providers</li>
  <li>a student guide</li>
</ul>

<p>T Level Transition Programmes delivered from September 2022 should follow the new Framework for Delivery and technical outcomes.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>In 2022 we will develop national technical outcomes for the fourth wave of T Level routes and publish these in autumn 2022 or earlier, for delivery from September 2023. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agriculture, Environmental and Animal Care</li>
  <li>Catering and Hospitality</li>
  <li>Creative and Design</li>
  <li>Hair and Beauty</li>
</ul>

<h2>T Levels rollout 2020, 2021 and 2022</h2>

<p>The first three T Levels were rolled out in September 2020, these were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>design, surveying and planning for construction</li>
  <li>digital production, design and development</li>
  <li>education and childcare</li>
</ul>

<p>A further 7 T Levels were introduced in 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>building services engineering for construction</li>
  <li>digital business services</li>
  <li>digital support and services</li>
  <li>health</li>
  <li>healthcare science</li>
  <li>onsite construction</li>
  <li>science</li>
</ul>

<p>The T Level Action Plan 2021 sets out how further T Levels will be rolled out. There are over 20 T Levels in total being rolled out in phases until September 2023.</p>

<p>We have published the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providers-selected-to-deliver-t-levels/further-providers-selected-to-deliver-t-levels-from-the-2021-to-2022-academic-year">2020, 2021 and 2022 T Level providers</a>. We are working with these providers to make sure they have the support they need to deliver T Levels successfully and to give them the opportunity to work with us to develop the new programmes.</p>

<h2>Registering providers to deliver T Levels from September 2023</h2>

<p>2023 will be the fourth year of T Level roll out and we intend to have all T Levels available by this point. To sustain momentum and reinforce T Levels as a mainstream offer for all students, we are increasing the number of providers able to deliver them. All providers currently funded to offer classroom-based study programmes to 16 to 19 year-olds will be able to register to deliver some of the available T Levels from September 2023:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all of these providers can offer T Levels that were introduced in 2020 and 2021</li>
  <li>T Levels introduced in 2022 and 2023 will be able to be delivered by Ofsted Good and Outstanding providers only</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-register-to-deliver-t-levels-in-2023-to-2024-academic-year">2023 T Level registration process</a> closes at midnight on 29 July 2022.</p>

<h2>Registering providers to deliver T Levels from September 2024</h2>

<p>2024 will be the fifth year of T Level roll out, when all T Levels will be available for delivery.</p>

<p>All providers currently funded to offer classroom-based study programmes to 16â€“19-year-olds can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-register-to-deliver-t-levels-from-2024-to-2025-academic-year">register up to the closing date</a>, which is midnight on 24 March 2023. Providers who register before the 29 July 2022 will also have access to implementation planning support and will be eligible to apply for T Level Capital funding.</p>

<h2>Funding for T Level delivery</h2>

<p>Information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-are-funded">how T Levels are funded</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Support for professional development</h2>

<p>To ensure that T Levels deliver great outcomes for learners, we are committed to ensuring that teachers and leaders have the support they need to deliver them well. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/supporting/technical-education/t-levels/" rel="external">T Level Professional Development (TLPD)</a> offer, led by the Education and Training Foundation (ETF) has been available since May 2019 at no charge to providers delivering and planning to deliver T Levels.</p>

<p>The offer will continue to be shaped around the needs of providers and their workforce alongside relevant regional, employer and curriculum needs. Providers will see changes to the offer â€“ for example, a move to Regional Facilitators to enhance and replace the Professional Development Adviser role, a more structured and tailored CPD journey, more opportunities for collaboration, and new leadership opportunities.</p>

<p>To ensure providers are up to date with the latest opportunities, the ETF will continue to publicise training and CPD via their newsletter and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/supporting/technical-education/t-levels/" rel="external">webpage</a>.</p>

<h2>Capital funding</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-levels-capital-fund">T Levels Capital Fund (TLCF)</a> will continue to help those further education providers at the forefront of delivering these important reforms.</p>

<p>Over Â£400m in capital funding has been made available to T Level providers to ensure that they have high quality facilities and industry standard equipment to deliver T Levels.</p>

<p>The T Levels Capital Fund comprised of two different elements â€“ the Building and Facilities Improvement Grant (BFIG) and Specialist Equipment Allocation (SEA).</p>

<p>Almost 150 building projects have been awarded funding through the first three waves of capital funding, aimed at providers delivering in 2020, 2021 and 2022. All providers have also received significant specialist equipment funding before they started delivering T Levels.</p>

<p>All T Level providers have also been allocated Specialist Equipment Funding before they start teaching to ensure that they can teach T Levels on industry standard equipment.</p>

<p>We are making funding of over Â£150m available for providers delivering in 2023. The BFIG element of that fund  closed for applications on 11 March 2022. Applicants will be informed of the outcome of their bid in Summer 2022. Further information on how to apply can be found at the link above.</p>

<h2>Communications and marketing</h2>

<p>Communications and marketing activity are a critical part of the implementation plan to raise awareness of and engagement with T Levels.</p>

<p>Following delivery of the targeted T Levels communications campaign, which ran from 2019, we will continue to build the T Level brand as part of the â€˜<a class="govuk-link" href="https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/explore-your-education-and-training-choices" rel="external">Get the Jump</a>â€™ Skills for Life campaign. This brings together, for the first time, all education and training choices for young people in one place.</p>

<p>The â€˜Get the Jumpâ€™ advertising campaign launched in January and is now running in England across:</p>

<ul>
  <li>out-of-home posters (including at bus stops);</li>
  <li>radio;</li>
  <li>podcasts;</li>
  <li>online video;</li>
  <li>social media and search engine ads.</li>
</ul>

<p>The campaign will also include a paid partnership with Snapchat, PR including influencer activity, regional media and a new â€˜Get the Jumpâ€™ <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/explore-your-education-and-training-choices" rel="external">content hub</a> available on the National Careers Service website.</p>

<p>We are also supporting T Level providers with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/get-the-jump-skills-for-life-campaign-toolkit#creative-assets">promotional materials</a>, regional PR and national search marketing. Previous <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/resources-and-materials-for-promoting-t-levels">T Level campaign materials</a> and toolkit are still available. The new campaign features the T Level brand to give the read across from the umbrella activity to specific T Level promotion.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tlevels.gov.uk/" rel="external">T Level website</a> provides information and resources for both students/parents and for employers. The site directs students/parents to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tlevels.gov.uk/students/find?Postcode=RM16+2DN&amp;NumberOfItemsToShow=10&amp;ShouldSearch=True&amp;SearchedQualificationId=0&amp;TotalRecordCount=181&amp;SelectedItemIndex=5&amp;SelectedQualificationId=0&amp;SubmitType=next" rel="external">Find a T Level directory</a> which links to local provider websites;  and directs employers to a contact form that links to the NAS Contact Centre or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://employers.tlevels.gov.uk/" rel="external">industry placement website</a> with additional materials and support.</p>

<p>We also continue to work closely with the Careers and Enterprise Company, Career Development Institute and Amazing Apprenticeships to help us raise awareness of T Levels within schools. We have developed a series of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-levels-resources-for-teachers-and-careers-advisers">resources</a> for careers advisers and teachers to help them better understand T Levels when advising students about their options.</p>
