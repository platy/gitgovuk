<p>The report highlights the contribution of the UK’s veteran population to the small business sector, with 6% of small business owned by veterans in Great Britain. However the report shows that there is scope for this to be increased, greater numbers of veterans starting, growing or working in Great Britain’s millions of small businesses would see benefits for individuals, businesses and communities.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Being a veteran myself, and understanding the hardships our military personnel endure upon leaving the military, any opportunity to showcase veterans’ skills, mindset and discipline is an opportunity we cannot miss.

<h2>Service Charity Sector: Insight and Engagement</h2>

<h3>RFEA works together with Amazon to support Forces employment</h3>

<p>RFEA – The Forces Employment Charity has signed a three-year agreement with Amazon Global Military Affairs as part of its enduring commitment to support the military community into employment. Testament to the already strong relationship with RFEA is the recent launch of the <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> Military Technical Account Manager Program (<abbr title="Military Technical Account Manager Program">MTAMP</abbr>), which was created in consultation with TechVets. <abbr title="Military Technical Account Manager Program">MTAMP</abbr> provides a structured path for veterans to become employed in technical roles at Amazon Web Services (<abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Blake Roberts joined the <abbr title="Military Technical Account Manager Program">MTAMP</abbr> after being medically discharged from the Army following a 9-year career. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I become increasingly interested in cloud technology and was looking to try and get into that space, however, I lacked the necessary experience. When I found out about the <abbr title="Military Technical Account Manager Program">MTAMP</abbr>, via TechVets, I was immediately interested and excited to be able to pursue my dream career in cloud technology. I was blown away on Day 1, everyone was very welcoming and supportive, as a new starter coming from a different world, that means a lot. I am very excited about my future with <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr>.</p>
