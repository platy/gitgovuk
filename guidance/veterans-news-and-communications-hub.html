<h3>Veteran Skills – building the energy system of the future</h3>

<p>Established in 2021, Mission Renewable, with the support of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.renewableuk.com" rel="external">Renewable UK</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.owic.org.uk" rel="external">Offshore Wind Industry Council (OWIC)</a>, entered the sector with a particular focus. Led by The Offshore Wind Industry Council’s ‘Investment in Talent’ group, Mission Renewable is working with the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> to develop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>new supported pathways for service leavers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the use of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.enhancedlearningcredits.com" rel="external">Enhanced Learning Credits</a> to fund the qualifications that they need to enter the Offshore Wind sector</p>

<p>After signing the Armed Forces Covenant in November 2021, the initiative was officially launched at this year’s Mission Automotive National Transition Event, hosted at Silverstone.</p>

<p>Speaking about the opportunities within the Renewable sector, Renewable UK’s Deputy Chief Executive Melanie Onn said:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p class="last-child">The number of jobs in the offshore wind industry alone is set to rise by over 40,000 in the next four years alone; this includes a range of team leadership roles and opportunities for people to use their valuable experience to learn new skills, so we’re urging women and men with a military background to join us to build the energy system of the future. This will help us to reduce consumers bills faster while taking practical action against climate change.</p>

<h3>Veterans: A Force for Business</h3>

<p>The report highlights the contribution of the UK’s veteran population to the small business sector, with 6% of small business owned by veterans in Great Britain. However the report shows that there is scope for this to be increased, greater numbers of veterans starting, growing or working in Great Britain’s millions of small businesses would see benefits for individuals, businesses and communities.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="info graphic with stats for service leavers, it shows there are 925,000 veterans of working age in the UK in 2016, and that 6% of small businesses are owned by veterans.

<p>Ren Kapur MBE (Founder and CEO, X-Forces Enterprise) said:</p>

<h2>Service Charity Sector: Insight and Engagement</h2>

<h3>RFEA works together with Amazon to support Forces employment</h3>

<p>RFEA – The Forces Employment Charity has signed a three-year agreement with Amazon Global Military Affairs as part of its enduring commitment to support the military community into employment. Testament to the already strong relationship with RFEA is the recent launch of the <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> Military Technical Account Manager Program (<abbr title="Military Technical Account Manager Program">MTAMP</abbr>), which was created in consultation with TechVets. <abbr title="Military Technical Account Manager Program">MTAMP</abbr> provides a structured path for veterans to become employed in technical roles at Amazon Web Services (<abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Blake Roberts joined the <abbr title="Military Technical Account Manager Program">MTAMP</abbr> after being medically discharged from the Army following a 9-year career. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I become increasingly interested in cloud technology and was looking to try and get into that space, however, I lacked the necessary experience. When I found out about the <abbr title="Military Technical Account Manager Program">MTAMP</abbr>, via TechVets, I was immediately interested and excited to be able to pursue my dream career in cloud technology. I was blown away on Day 1, everyone was very welcoming and supportive, as a new starter coming from a different world, that means a lot. I am very excited about my future with <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr>.</p>
