<p>4.1 In advance of the full UKSPF Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy publication in Autumn, this section sets out the emerging M&amp;E framework for the UKSPF. DLUHC expect lead local authorities to help contribute to the evidence base on what works.</p>

<p>4.2 Evaluation is integral to understanding the impact of the UKSPF. Due to the scale and size of the individual projects that the UKSPF may fund, DLUHC need to supplement local level evaluations to better understand the impacts of the UKSPF. DLUHC will coordinate national evaluation, but will need lead local authorities to engage and support this centrally coordinated evaluation work. Lead local authorities should continue to develop and conduct their own robust and credible evaluations. For those lead local authorities with larger allocations, the emphasis on proportionate and rigorous evaluation is increasingly important.</p>

<h2>The monitoring and evaluation framework</h2>

<p>4.3. The M&amp;E framework will contribute to understanding the Fund’s impact on Pride in Place and life chances through programme, place, and intervention level evaluation.</p>

<p>4.4 There are 6 aspects to the M&amp;E framework over the three levels:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Intervention level
    <ul>
      <li>Pride in place and life chances survey</li>
      <li>Intervention impact evaluations</li>
      <li>Randomised control trials</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Place level - UK wide
    <ul>
      <li>Place level case studies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Programme level
    <ul>
      <li>Programme level evaluation</li>
      <li>Multiply evaluation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Intervention level</h4>

<p>4.5 Pride in place is an area where DLUHC is eager to develop metrics and build the evidence base (i.e. develop an understanding of what interventions work to improve the outcomes). Therefore, DLUHC is commissioning the pride in place and life chances survey to standardise measures and to help consistency of understanding, the impact of the UKSPF interventions across the UK. This survey will be funded and procured by DLUHC, enabling lead local authorities to use a standard survey and methodology to measure change. Lead local authorities are expected to use this survey for the purposes of  benchmarking.</p>

<p>4.6 DLUHC will manage evaluation of a sample of intervention types with a third-party contractor, to gain in-depth understanding of how the UKSPF intervention types have worked in delivery. Intervention types will be chosen based on evidence gaps, scale of interventions, and evaluation methods.</p>

<p>4.7 DLUHC will invite lead local authorities to submit interventions for considerations for randomised control trials (RCTs).</p>

<h4>Place level</h4>

<p>4.8 DLUHC will commission 36 place based evaluation case studies (in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), to understand how the UKSPF has worked in places. The case studies will specifically focus on the role of the places, interactions between stakeholders, decision making, the different interventions and local growth funds, and processes. Details on the role of lead local authorities will be set out in the UKSPF M&amp;E Strategy to be published in early Autumn.</p>

<p>4.9 Lead local authorities that have a total allocation of £60m or more should expect to be part of the DLUHC commissioned place based evaluation samples.</p>

<h4>Programme level</h4>

<p>4.10 DLUHC have consulted the What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth (WWG) and evaluation experts to begin to develop a programme level evaluation as part of the wider UKSPF evaluation portfolio. DLUHC will explore a regression approach drawing upon publicly available data, reducing the requirements of lead local authorities beyond what has already been set out. The detail of the programme level evaluation will be included in the M&amp;E Strategy.</p>

<h3>Monitoring Multiply in Scotland and Wales</h3>

<p>4.11 Multiply is a new £559m, 3-year programme that is a part of the UKSPF. A core part of the programme is to build the evidence base on ‘what works’ in improving adult numeracy.</p>

<p>4.12 In Scotland and Wales, DLUHC is the responsible delivery department, delivery will use the same geographical structures as core UKSPF.</p>

<p>4.13 DfE is the lead department for Multiply delivery in England as well as the UK wide digital platform and programme of evaluation for Multiply in England. Where possible, DLUHC will work with DfE to align the evaluation approach in Scotland and Wales to the evaluation approach in England, recognising the different skills infrastructures in different nations.</p>

<p>4.14 DLUHC will expect lead local authorities in Scotland and Wales to ensure third party suppliers collect information on individuals who participate in any substantive Multiply intervention, where it is practical to do so. Data collection should not prove to be a barrier to those looking to access Multiply provision, for example if there were safeguarding issues or a participant did not want to provide personal data this should not prevent their access to Multiply interventions. Where the provision is delivered in-house by a lead local authority, then this information should be captured directly by the lead local authority. This data collection is in line with the data collection approach that will be conducted by DfE in England.</p>

<p>4.15 Details will be provided to the lead local authorities in due course setting out the information that should be collected from learners.</p>

<p>4.16 This data on individual learners will be used to track learners’ longitudinal progression and to evaluate the impact Multiply has had on their long term income (where appropriate). After the evaluation of Multiply is completed, all individual data will be deleted. The exact length of the data retention period will be outlined in the upcoming Evaluation Strategy (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.uk/guidance/uk-shared-prosperity-fund-reporting-and-performance-management-3" rel="external">paras. 3.16 to 3.23</a> for DLUHC’s data handling plans)</p>

<p>4.17 The mechanism by which the data captured on Multiply in Scotland and Wales will be communicated in the UKSPF Evaluation Strategy and will include details on appropriate data privacy notices. The data will be requested by providers and transferred to DLUHC for management.</p>

<p>4.18 The lead local authority will need to ensure that the appropriate privacy notices are in place to capture this information from third parties and individual Multiply learners.</p>

<p>4.19 The costs for providing this data should be part of each lead local authority’s administration costs for the Fund.</p>

<h3>The role of lead local authorities</h3>

<p>4.20 DLUHC will expect lead local authorities to capture and hold data sets to support monitoring, in addition to the formal reporting requests set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-shared-prosperity-fund-reporting-and-performance-management-3">reporting section.</a></p>

<p>4.21 DLUHC will require lead local authorities to obtain unique identification numbers from beneficiaries of interventions as set out in section 9.3 of the Prospectus.</p>

<p>4.22 Lead local authorities are expected to collect National Insurance Numbers (NINO), for individuals who have directly benefitted from the People &amp; Skills interventions, particularly in relation to interventions that result in personal income and labour market outcomes and impacts. Lead local authorities should be pragmatic when collecting NINOs from participants who may not have a NINO, or access to an existing one.</p>

<p>4.23 Lead local authorities should also collect Company Record Numbers (CRN) for all businesses who directly benefit from UKSPF interventions within their area.&nbsp;This data will need to be captured and stored by lead local authorities for the duration of the project.</p>

<p>4.24 Lead local authorities will need to ensure that privacy notices are in place to inform data subjects of the need to collect and share personal data, including NINO and CRN data.</p>

<p>4.25 DLUHC will set out timings and mechanisms of how this data should be passed from lead local authority to the Department in the Evaluation Strategy (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.uk/guidance/uk-shared-prosperity-fund-reporting-and-performance-management-3" rel="external">see paras. 3.16 to 3.23</a> for DLUHC’s data handling plans). DLUHC will arrange data sharing agreements with lead local authorities to facilitate sharing along with any necessary privacy notices. The data will be used by DLUHC as part of a data matching exercise.</p>

<p>4.26 The costs for providing this data should be part of each lead local authorities’ administration costs for the Fund.</p>

<h3>Further evaluation information</h3>

<p>4.27 The UKSPF Evaluation Strategy will be published in the Autumn when investment plans have been received. The Evaluation Strategy will set out the proposed programme, place and intervention level evaluation that will be conducted by DLUHC in detail. DLUHC may also conduct primary data collection in selected areas.</p>

<p>4.28 Any expectations of lead authorities to engage with evaluation activities will be set out in the Evaluation Strategy will be proportionate and should be funded by lead local authorities’ administration budgets, unless otherwise stated in the Evaluation Strategy. The outline of the types of evaluation activity are set out in section 4.3.</p>

<p>4.29 DLUHC encourage lead local authorities to consider opportunities to undertake RCTs where possible and will aim to support any place that is considering RCTs. More information will be included in the Evaluation Strategy. RCTs could be used to test whether a project has achieved its desired impact, or they could be used to test which is the more effective of two or more different ways of doing things. For example, an RCT was recently conducted to determine if it was more effect for police to do frequent shorter patrols or less frequent longer patrols.</p>

<p>4.30 Places are encouraged to undertake their own place-based evaluations of how the UKSPF has worked in their area, particularly process evaluation on individual projects, alongside the place-based case studies commissioned by DLUHC (see section 4.7). For those lead local authorities with large allocations, DLUHC require a robust evaluation to support the centrally coordinated evaluation. Proposed methods would include measuring outputs, contribution analysis, developing case studies, conducting surveys and interviews with stakeholders and beneficiaries. As per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.uk/guidance/uk-shared-prosperity-fund-reporting-and-performance-management-3" rel="external">section 3</a> DLUHC has asked to be informed when this is taking place.</p>

<p>4.31 Lead local authorities do not need to indicate to DLUHC what their local evaluation strategy will be as part of their investment plan but will form part of annual reporting. To support lead local authorities, DLUHC will provide evaluation guidance as part of the Evaluation Strategy.</p>
