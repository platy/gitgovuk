<h2 id="moving-equines-to-the-eu-from-1-january-2021">Moving equines to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>To move horses and other equines from the UK to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> from 1 January 2021, you’ll need to contact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your official vet to book an appointment so you can get blood tests taken in time</li>
  <li>an agent or transporter and tell them when you plan to travel - you may need more time to plan travel through an <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1563184991622&uri=CELEX:02009D0821-20190107" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border control post (<abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr>)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#Tests-for-equines" class="govuk-link">get equines tested for certain diseases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Isolation-residency" class="govuk-link">meet isolation and residency requirements</a></li>
  <li><a href="#EHC" class="govuk-link">apply for an export health certificate (<abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr>)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Equine-ID" class="govuk-link">check you have the right equine identification (ID)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#welfare-declaration" class="govuk-link">check if you need an export welfare declaration</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Tests-for-equines">Tests for equines before export</h3>

<p>You’ll need to get your equines tested so they’re free of certain diseases.</p>

<p>You’ll need tests for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>equine infectious anaemia - within 30 days before travel for permanent exports, or 90 days before travel for temporary exports of under 90 days (for horses registered with a national branch of an international body for sporting and competition purposes)</li>
  <li>equine viral arteritis - within 21 days of travel for uncastrated male equines older than 180 days, unless they meet vaccination requirements</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Isolation-residency">Isolation and residency requirements before export</h3>

<p>You’ll need to keep horses and other equines in certain conditions before export.</p>

<p>Before you export temporarily (less than 90 days) a horse registered with a national branch of an international body for sporting or competition purposes, you will need to keep it on a holding in the UK or a country with a similar health status either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for 40 days</li>
  <li>since its entry to the UK, if the animal was imported directly from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or a country with a similar health status to the UK less than 40 days before you export</li>
</ul>

<p>Before permanent export, or temporary export of any other equine, you’ll need to keep the animal separate from other equines that do not have equivalent health status for at least 30 days.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to keep the animal on a holding in the UK under veterinary supervision, or a country with similar health status either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for 90 days</li>
  <li>since birth if the animal is younger than 90 days old</li>
  <li>since its entry to the UK if the animal was imported directly from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> less than 90 days before you export</li>
</ul>

<p>Your supervising vet does not need to be an official vet. However, an official vet must confirm that you’ve met these requirements before you export the equine.</p>

<h3 id="EHC">Apply for an export health certificate (<abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>You need to complete an <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> and some supporting documents to export a live animal from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> will replace the Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (<abbr title="Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate">ITAHC</abbr>) for exports to countries in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>To apply for an <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> you’ll need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> and other forms you need on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates" class="govuk-link">export health certificate form finder</a>. If you’re exporting from Northern Ireland, contact your local <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact" class="govuk-link">Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr>) office</a>. Most EHCs have guidance documents telling you how to fill out the certificate.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Nominate an official vet to inspect your horse or other equines. There are various ways you can find one:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-a-professional-to-certify-export-health-certificates" class="govuk-link">list of professionals who can certify export health certificates</a>
</li>
      <li>ask at your local vet</li>
      <li>email <a href="mailto:csconehealthovteam@apha.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">csconehealthovteam@apha.gov.uk</a> (if you’re in Northern Ireland contact <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr></a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fill in the <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> and supporting forms and email them to the Animal Plant and Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) address on the forms.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will send your <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> to your official vet within 7 working days, or within one working day if you plan to export in the next 7 working days. They’ll provide copies in the languages of the destination country and the country where the horse or other equine first enters the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Arrange for the official vet to check the horse or other equine meets the health requirements of the destination country within 48 hours of travel. The official vet will complete and sign the <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> and send a copy to <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The official vet must give you the <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> on the same day that you load the animals for travel.</li>
  <li>Keep the completed <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> and other documents with the animal during travel.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s no fee for the certificate, but you’ll need to pay for your vet’s services.</p>

<p>If you’re in Northern Ireland, contact <a rel="external" href="https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr></a> for specific advice.</p>

<h3 id="Equine-ID">Check you have the right equine ID</h3>

<p>You’ll be able to use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/horse-passport" class="govuk-link">horse passport (industry-issued equine ID)</a> to export equines registered with one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-recognised studbook or pedigree register</li>
  <li>a national branch of an international racing or competition organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>To export all other equines, you’ll need to apply for a government-issued equine ID from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> if you’re in Great Britain - find the application form on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/export-health-certificates" class="govuk-link">form finder</a>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs">DAERA</abbr> if you’re in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will tell you when they have sent your equine ID form to your official vet. Your official vet will give you the equine ID with the <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> when they check the animal before travel.</p>

<p>You’ll need to keep the equine ID together with the horse passport and the <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> with the animal during travel.</p>

<p>The equine ID will be valid for a single journey to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and return to the UK. You’ll need to apply for a government-issued equine ID every time you move an unregistered horse to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="eu-border-rules">
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border rules</h3>
<p>You’ll need to complete a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-declarations-for-goods-taken-out-of-the-eu" class="govuk-link">customs declaration form</a> before the equine arrives at the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> border.</p>

<p>Plan your trade route so that your animal can be inspected at an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr>. Some BCPs accept both registered and unregistered equines but not all do. You’ll need to check the <a rel="external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1563184991622&uri=CELEX:02009D0821-20190107" class="govuk-link">correct <abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr></a> to go through.</p>

<p>Make sure you or your <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-based import agent has notified the <abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr> on <abbr title="Trade Control and Expert System">TRACES</abbr>, in advance, that your consignment is arriving - check with the <abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr> for how much notice needs to be given.</p>

<h3 id="recognition-of-uk-studbooks">Recognition of UK studbooks</h3>

<p>The UK has applied to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for the recognition of UK studbooks. You should plan any exports on the basis that the UK’s studbooks will not be recognised immediately from 1 January 2021. This means if you’re exporting a horse registered in a UK studbook you should follow the <a href="#Tests-for-equines" class="govuk-link">rules set out for unregistered horses.</a></p>

<p>If recognition is granted, horses in recognised UK studbooks will be able to use export health certificates that are only available to registered horses.</p>

<p>This would mean these horses can follow the same rules for blood testing, residency and isolation as horses registered with a national branch of international body for racing or competition when moving to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for under 90 days.</p>

<p>In addition, these horses would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no longer need a government-issued equine ID to move from the UK to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>be able to enter the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via BCPs approved for registered equines</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-export-requirements">Other export requirements</h3>

<p>Before exporting, businesses must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register for an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eori" class="govuk-link">Economic Operator Register and Identification (<abbr title="Economic Operator Register and Identification">EORI</abbr>) number</a>
</li>
  <li>be aware of potential <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-temporary-rates-of-customs-duty-on-imports-after-eu-exit" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> trade tariff changes</a>
</li>
  <li>find out the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports" class="govuk-link">commodity code</a> for their goods</li>
  <li>choose the correct <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-customs-procedure-codes/customs-procedure-codes-box-37" class="govuk-link">customs procedure code</a> (<abbr title="Customs Procedure Code">CPC</abbr>) for their goods</li>
  <li>consider applying for an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/taking-goods-out-uk-temporarily/get-an-ata-carnet" class="govuk-link">ATA carnet</a> to streamline customs processes</li>
  <li>check the wider <a href="https://www.gov.uk/business-uk-leaving-eu" class="govuk-link">HMRC guidance for exporters</a>
</li>
  <li>read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/brexit/preparingforbrexit/" class="govuk-link">guidance from the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine</a> in the Republic of Ireland (<abbr title="Republic of Ireland">ROI</abbr>) if you regularly move horses or other equines between the UK and <abbr title="Republic of Ireland">ROI</abbr>

<h3 id="moving-horses-to-switzerland-liechtenstein-norway-or-iceland">Moving horses to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Iceland</h3>
<p>From 1 January 2021, if you want to move horses from the UK to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Iceland you should consult your transporter or the competent authority in the country you’re exporting to.</p>

<h3 id="re-entry-to-the-eu">Re-entry to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> owners returning horses to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> can use a streamlined re-entry process for registered horses that have been in the UK for less than 30 days for racing or competitions. Under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> rules, these horses will need a health certificate or veterinary health attestation from their own country proving when the animal left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>In this streamlined re-entry process, animals still need an <abbr title="export health certificate">EHC</abbr> and equine ID but do not need to have blood tests or meet the same residency and isolation requirements.
