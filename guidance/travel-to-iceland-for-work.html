<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>
<p>If you’re going to Iceland to work (or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU</a>, Switzerland, Norway or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>Iceland’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/about-directorate-of-immigration" rel="external">Iceland’s government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Iceland. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/about-directorate-of-immigration" rel="external">Iceland’s immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Iceland, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Iceland’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>
<p>You do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Iceland for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>negotiating deals or contracts</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs or conferences</li>
  <li>attending board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers, including entertainment like eating at a restaurant</li>
  <li>negotiating and signing contracts</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>touring a company facility</li>
  <li>attending court as a witness</li>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>fact-finding visits</li>
</ul>

<p>Or for the following types of training for 90 days in a 180-day period, as long as it’s for the same company or group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving classroom-based training</li>
  <li>receiving on-the-job training</li>
  <li>shadowing someone’s job</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not receive payment for these activities from a company in Iceland.</p>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Notify the authorities</h3>

<p>Your employer, or you if you’re self-employed, must <a class="govuk-link" href="http://form.vinnumalastofnun.is/exemption/default.aspx" rel="external">submit a notification</a> to the Directorate of Labour if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>negotiating deals or contracts</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs or conferences</li>
  <li>attending board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers, including entertainment like eating at a restaurant</li>
  <li>negotiating and signing contracts</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>touring a company facility</li>
</ul>

<p>They must do this no later than your first day in Iceland.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from the company in Iceland or alternative documents showing the purpose of your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Iceland’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>The following <a class="govuk-link" href="https://vinnumalastofnun.is/en/work-permits/categories-of-work-permits/exemptions-of-work-permit-requirement-due-to-short-term-projects" rel="external">do not require a visa or permit in Iceland</a> if they’re for less than 90 days in a 12-month period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>professors, lecturers, scientists, including doctors and interns, who are teaching, or conducting research, scientific activities or related activities, if you have a bachelor’s level degree</li>
  <li>artists and the technical production team for film, audio-visual content and shows, excluding performers who play instruments in catering establishments, such as restaurants</li>
  <li>athletics coaches working for an Icelandic team</li>
  <li>representatives on business trips for companies that don’t have a branch in Iceland</li>
  <li>UK-registered passenger coach drivers as long as the vehicles are carrying non-Icelandic tourists to Iceland</li>
  <li>employees, consultants or instructors working on the assembly, installation, supervision or repair of equipment where the warranty requires the work to be carried out by specialist employees or third parties appointed by the seller</li>
  <li>journalists or reporters from non-Icelandic news media, working for companies not established in Iceland</li>
</ul>

<p>Your employer, or you if you’re self-employed, needs to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://form.vinnumalastofnun.is/exemption/default.aspx" rel="external">submit a notification</a> to the Directorate of Labour no later than your first day of work.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>
<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment letter</li>
  <li>employment confirmation</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma or professional certificate</li>
  <li>CV</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Iceland’s embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/about-directorate-of-immigration" rel="external">Iceland’s immigration authorities</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>
<p>If you have a spouse or partner you live with, or children under 18 they can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/long-term-visa-for-remote-workers-and-their-family-members" rel="external">apply for long-term visas and join you</a>.</p>

<h3>Visas, work permits and residence permits</h3>

<p>You need to apply for a visa or permit if you’re in Iceland because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#remote">working remotely from Iceland for a UK-based business (employed or self-employed</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing services to a client in Iceland</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a company in Iceland on an Icelandic contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#athlete">working in Iceland as an athlete or sports coach</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They’re valid for up to 2 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<h2>Working remotely from Iceland for a UK-based business</h2>

<p>To qualify for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/long-term-visa-for-remote-workers-and-their-family-members" rel="external">long-term visa for remote workers</a> you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have not been issued a long-term visa by Icelandic authorities within 12 months of applying</li>
  <li>not intend to live permanently in Iceland</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/long-term-visa-for-remote-workers-and-their-family-members" rel="external">meet income requirements</a></li>
  <li>keep your contract with your UK employer and intend to work remotely for them, if you’re an employee</li>
  <li>keep your business in the UK and intend to work remotely from Iceland, if you’re self-employed</li>

<p>If you have a spouse or partner you live with, or children under 18 they can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://utl.is/index.php/en/long-term-visa-for-remote-workers-and-their-family-members" rel="external">apply for a long-term visa and join you</a>. They must qualify for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa exemption</a> to be eligible for a long-term visa.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>You need to check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Iceland’s embassy or consulate</a> on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
