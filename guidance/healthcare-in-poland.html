<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Poland.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This information is about living in Poland. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance about visiting Poland.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Poland has an insurance-based healthcare system. If you’re not insured, you may be charged for using state healthcare services.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Polish healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying insurance contributions to the Polish state health system state through their employer</li>
  <li>paying voluntary insurance contributions  to the Polish state health system directly</li>
  <li>taking out private health insurance</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering an UK-issued <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">S1 form</a> with the Polish state health system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Poland</h2>
<p>If you’re employed, monthly insurance contributions to the National Health Fund (NFZ) are taken from your salary before you’re paid.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not working, you can pay <a href="http://www.nfz-lublin.pl/voluntary_health_insurance" rel="external" class="govuk-link">voluntary insurance contributions</a> directly to the National Health Fund each month. You cannot do this if you’re registered as unemployed in Poland.</p>

<p>Your dependants will be covered by your insurance if they do not have their own.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Polish <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-poland" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> at the administrative offices of your provincial authority.</p>

<p>You then need to register with the National Health Fund.</p>

<p>If you work for a Polish employer, they’ll register you.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not working, go to your regional branch of the National Health Fund.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.nfz-lublin.pl/voluntary_health_insurance" class="govuk-link">Find out what documents you need to bring from the National Health Fund website.</a></p>

<p>Show ID and proof of your insurance when you visit a doctor.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>Monthly contributions cost 9% of your salary if you’re employed.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not working, monthly contributions are based on national average salary.</p>

<p>State health services are free if you pay insurance contributions, but you need to pay for some prescription medicines.</p>

<p>You can use some private health facilities for free if the facility has a contract with the Polish state health system.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Poland temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Poland using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Poland</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-poland" class="govuk-link">Polish resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Poland before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Polish system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Poland on the same basis as a Polish citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Poland than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Poland</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 form with the National Health Fund.</p>

<p>Once registered, you’ll get a certificate confirming your registration with NFZ. This shows that you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Polish citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Poland</h2>
<p>You can use an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" rel="external"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
