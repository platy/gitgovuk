<p>What you need to do when you travel to England depends on whether you qualify as fully vaccinated or not.</p>

<p>To qualify under the fully vaccinated rules for travel to England, you must have been fully vaccinated with a full course of an approved vaccine under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> overseas vaccination programme</li>
  <li>the United Nations vaccine programme for staff and volunteers</li>
  <li>an approved programme in one of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#countries-with-an-approved-proof-of-vaccination-and-examples-of-proof-required">countries or territories listed below</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can still travel to England if you do not qualify as fully vaccinated but <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#if-you-are-not-fully-vaccinated">you must follow different rules</a>.</p>

<p>There are also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">different rules if you have been in a red list country or territory</a> in the last 10 days and you may not be allowed to enter England.</p>

<h2>Approved vaccines</h2>

<p>You must have had a complete course of one of the following vaccines at least 14 days before you arrive in England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oxford/AstraZeneca</li>
  <li>Pfizer BioNTech</li>
  <li>Moderna</li>
  <li>Janssen</li>
</ul>

<p>The day you have your final dose does not count as one of the 14 days.</p>

<p>Formulations of these vaccines, such as AstraZeneca Covishield, AstraZeneca Vaxzevria and Moderna Takeda, also qualify as approved vaccines.</p>

<h3>2 dose vaccines</h3>

<p>If you were vaccinated with a 2 dose vaccine (Moderna, Pfizer BioNTech, Oxford AstraZeneca, or a combination of them), you must have had both doses to be considered fully vaccinated for travel to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>This applies in all cases, even if you’ve recently recovered from COVID-19 and have natural immunity.</p>

<p>Those who have had COVID-19 and have only had one dose of a 2 dose vaccine must follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#if-you-are-not-fully-vaccinated">the rules for unvaccinated arrivals</a>.</p>

<p>Where 2 doses of a vaccine are required for a full course, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mix 2 different types of vaccine from the above list, for example Oxford/AstraZeneca and Moderna</li>
  <li>have the 2 vaccinations under 2 different approved programmes, for example Australia and Japan, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>, France and Canada</li>
</ul>

<h3>Single dose vaccines</h3>

<p>If you had an approved one dose vaccine (the Janssen vaccine), you are fully vaccinated.</p>

<h2>Proof of vaccination</h2>

<p>You must be able to prove that you’ve been fully vaccinated under a vaccination programme  with approved proof of certification.</p>

<p>There are several ways to prove vaccination status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID pass</a> if you live in England</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Digital COVID Certificate</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a rel="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html" class="govuk-link">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccination card</a> for US residents</li>
  <li>a vaccine certificate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vaccine certificates only</h3>

<p>If you use a vaccine certificate as proof, it must be issued by a national or state-level public health authority, be in English, French or Spanish, and include as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your forename and surname(s)</li>
  <li>your date of birth</li>
  <li>vaccine brand and manufacturer</li>
  <li>date of vaccination for every dose</li>
  <li>country or territory of vaccination and/or certificate issuer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Countries with an approved proof of vaccination and examples of proof required</h2>

<p>List of countries and territories with approved proof of vaccination for travel to England and examples of proof of vaccination.</p>

<p>If you were vaccinated in a country or territory that is not on this list, or with <a href="#approved-vaccines" class="govuk-link">a vaccine that is not listed</a>, you must follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">rules for people who do not qualify as fully vaccinated</a>.</p>

<p>If you have been in a red list country or territory in the 10 days before you arrive in England, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">follow the red list rules</a>. You must do this whether you qualify as fully vaccinated or not.</p>
