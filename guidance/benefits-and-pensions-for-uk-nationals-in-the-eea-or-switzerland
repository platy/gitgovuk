<p>The changes to these rules will depend on the outcome of negotiations with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. If you are considering moving to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> on or after 1 January, please continue to check this page for future updates.</p>

<h3 id="pensions">Pensions</h3>

  <li>getting your UK State Pension uprated every year in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> and Switzerland</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>stopping the payment of Child Benefit for those not covered by the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/854209/WAB_Fact_Sheet_-_CITIZENS_RIGHTS.pdf" class="govuk-link">Withdrawal Agreement</a></p>
  </li>

<h3 id="moving-to-an-eea-state-or-switzerland-from-1-january-2021-1">Moving to an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> state or Switzerland from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you move to an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> state or Switzerland from 1 January 2021 and you are not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, your entitlement to a pension or benefits from that country will depend on the outcome of negotiations with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="annuities-and-personal-pensions-from-a-uk-pension-provider">Annuities and personal pensions from a UK pension provider</h2>

<p>Your pension provider should have made plans to make sure you can still get payments from your annuity or personal pension following the UK leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your pension provider should contact you if they need to make changes to your annuity or pension or the way you are paid. The Financial Conduct Authority has published information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/preparing-for-brexit" class="govuk-link">what pension providers need to do because the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, contact your pension provider.</p>

<h2 id="uk-workplace-pensions">UK workplace pensions</h2>

<p>UK law allows for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions" class="govuk-link">workplace pensions</a> to be paid overseas. The government does not expect this to change because the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, contact your pension provider.</p>

<p>If your workplace pension is paid into a UK bank account, your bank should contact you if they need to change the way you receive your pension because the UK has left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>
