</ul>
</div>

<h2>Generic Design Assessment</h2>

<p>Government has stated that nuclear power plays an important role as part of a mix of different energy sources.  In 2007 the UK government asked the regulators to work together to introduce a new process for assessing designs for new nuclear power stations.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency and <abbr title="Office for Nuclear Regulation">ONR</abbr> developed a process called Generic Design Assessment (<abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr>). They use this process to scrutinise new nuclear power stations at an early stage. This is before a developer has formed detailed proposals for building at a specific site or applied for licences or permits. This means that the regulators can identify potential design or technical concerns early on and ask the designer to resolve them.</p>

<p>The process has 3 steps, with the assessment becoming increasingly more detailed. If the design company still has significant issues to resolve after the regulators have completed their planned assessments, further steps can be added to the process.</p>

<p>It takes around 4 years to complete the 3 steps of the <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Initiation</li>
  <li>Step 2: Fundamental Assessment</li>
  <li>Step 3: Detailed Assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>The design company must provide detailed information to make the environment case for their nuclear power station design. The regulators will carefully examine the information and will ask questions. They will request further information if necessary and identify if changes to the design might be needed.</p>

<p>At the end of each step, the regulators issue statements and reports about their findings. What they issue will depend on the scope of the <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> they agreed with the design company during Step 1.</p>

<p>If the agreed scope is sufficiently broad and detailed, with the potential to achieve a ‘Statement of Design Acceptability’ (<abbr title="Statement of Design Acceptability">SoDA</abbr>), then we will consider issuing one. We will only issue a <abbr title="Statement of Design Acceptability">SoDA</abbr> if we judge that the design is acceptable. Similarly <abbr title="Office for Nuclear Regulation">ONR</abbr> will consider issuing a ‘Design Acceptance Confirmation’ (<abbr title="Design Acceptance Confirmation">DAC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Issuing a <abbr title="Statement of Design Acceptability">SoDA</abbr> and <abbr title="Design Acceptance Confirmation">DAC</abbr> means that the regulators consider that if a new nuclear power station were built using that design, it should be capable of meeting the UK’s high standards of safety, security and environmental protection.</p>

<p>Before a site operator can build a new nuclear power station, they must apply for and obtain all of the site specific approvals they need. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>environmental permits for construction and operation</li>
  <li>a development consent order (planning permission) from the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</li>
  <li>a nuclear site licence and other safety and security consents from <abbr title="Office for Nuclear Regulation">ONR</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When making decisions about an operator’s environmental permit applications for a proposed site, the Environment Agency will take account of all the work it has done during <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>More information about <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The regulators have produced some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-new-nuclear-power-stations-infographics">infographics about <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Modernised <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> process and updated guidance</h2>

<p>In 2019 the regulators modernised the <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> process, using their learning from previous assessments. They have made the process more flexible to help with the assessment of small modular reactors.  This includes providing other options for the <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> outcome, in addition to the current option of issuing (or not) a <abbr title="Design Acceptance Confirmation">DAC</abbr> and <abbr title="Statement of Design Acceptability">SoDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-nuclear-power-plants-generic-design-assessment-guidance-for-requesting-parties">updated guidance</a> for organisations who want to submit a design for assessment. We refer to these organisations as ‘requesting parties’ because they can be made up of a number of companies, including nuclear power station designers and operators. The guidance explains the <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> process and the information they must provide.</p>

<p>In developing the modernised <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> process the regulators have been careful to make sure that a requesting party still has to meet the same requirements and expectations to achieve a <abbr title="Statement of Design Acceptability">SoDA</abbr> and <abbr title="Design Acceptance Confirmation">DAC</abbr>.</p>

<p>GDAs started before 2019 followed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-of-candidate-nuclear-power-plant-designs">earlier versions of guidance produced by the Environment Agency</a> and by <abbr title="Office for Nuclear Regulation">ONR</abbr>.</p>

<p>The regulators will be using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-nuclear-power-plants-generic-design-assessment-guidance-for-requesting-parties">the updated guidance</a> for all future GDAs.</p>

<h2>Public and stakeholder engagement</h2>

<p><abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> is an open and transparent process. The nuclear regulators worked with Sciencewise to understand how the public wants to be informed and consulted about assessing new nuclear power station designs. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://sciencewise.org.uk/projects/new-nuclear-power-stations-improving-public-involvement-in-reactor-design-assessments/?portfolioCats=43%2C44%2C45%2C46%2C15" rel="external">final report about this work</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways the public and other stakeholders can get involved in <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> comments process</h3>

<p>A nuclear power station design company going through <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> must set up a website to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>publish information about the design</li>
  <li>invite the public to ask questions and make comments</li>
</ul>

<p>The design company must respond to any comments or questions they receive.</p>

<p>The regulators will see the comments and questions and the responses provided. They can also use this information to help inform their assessment work.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency and <abbr title="Office for Nuclear Regulation">ONR</abbr> have set up a Joint Programme Office (<abbr title="Joint Programme Office">JPO</abbr>) to help administer the <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> process. During <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Joint Programme Office">JPO</abbr> acts as a single point of contact between the regulators and the design company. The public and stakeholders can also send their comments to the <abbr title="Joint Programme Office">JPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>The comments process is open throughout a <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr>. It closes about 4 months before the regulators issue statements at the end of steps 2 and 3, or make decisions about issuing a <abbr title="Statement of Design Acceptability">SoDA</abbr> or <abbr title="Design Acceptance Confirmation">DAC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.onr.org.uk/new-reactors/public-involvement.htm" rel="external">comments process document on the <abbr title="Office for Nuclear Regulation">ONR</abbr> website</a> has more information about how it works.</p>

<h3>Consulting on <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> findings</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency will consult on its preliminary <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> findings from the detailed assessment if the scope agreed with the requesting party is sufficient to consider issuing a <abbr title="Statement of Design Acceptability">SoDA</abbr>. This follows the same approach as the original <abbr title="Generic Design Assessment">GDA</abbr> process.  If the agreed scope is not sufficient to consider issuing a <abbr title="Statement of Design Acceptability">SoDA</abbr>, the Environment Agency will not consult.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will carefully consider all the comments we receive during the consultation on our preliminary findings. We will use the comments to help inform our assessment and decision about whether to issue a <abbr title="Statement of Design Acceptability">SoDA</abbr> for a particular design.</p>

<h3>Meetings and events</h3>

<p>You can talk to the Environment Agency about assessing new nuclear power station designs at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>site stakeholder groups</li>
  <li>local community liaison councils</li>
  <li>industry conferences</li>
  <li>public events</li>
</ul>

<p>To find out when these will take place, email the Environment Agency: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:nuclear@environment-agency.gov.uk">nuclear@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p>
