<h3>Broad comparability assessments</h3>

<p>On 6 August 2020 <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> issued a note explaining that the certification of broad comparability had been suspended in response to the McCloud judgment.</p>

<p>Following an analysis of developments, and discussions with stakeholders, <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> is now able to start a rolling programme of recommencing some broad comparability work. There are 2 important points to note in connection with this recommencement programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initially <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr>’s broad comparability assessments will only involve the assessment of Career Average Revalued (CARE) benefits. For transfers prior to 1 April 2022, there may be further adjustments needed to address McCloud remedy. If so, <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> will notify Contracting Authorities as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Contracting Authorities need to ensure that when staff move to their new pension scheme with effect from the transfer date, they do not suffer a reduction in take-home pay, for example due to differences in scheme member contribution rates. Click the link below for further information on this subject:</li>

<p>For existing cases which were suspended, your usual <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> advisor should be in touch to discuss recommencement, and similarly for cases which were not started in earnest prior to August 2020. Alternatively, please feel free to contact your normal <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> advisor. For new cases, and for any other queries, please contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:stafftransfers@gad.gov.uk">stafftransfers@gad.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Pension bulk transfers</h3>

<p>On 10 September 2020 <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> issued a note explaining that pension bulk transfer work in Machinery of Government/COSOP transfers had been paused while uncertainty remained around the details of remedy.</p>

<p>Scheme managers have agreed that they are content to restart paused bulk transfers between public service pension schemes for England, Scotland and Wales from 1 April 2022. Bulk transfers which involve a public service pension scheme for Northern Ireland remain paused.</p>

<p>Your usual <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> advisor should be in touch to discuss recommencement, and similarly for cases which were not started in earnest prior to August 2020. Alternatively, please feel free to contact your normal <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> advisor.</p>

<p>New Fair Deal bulk transfer work, for example on contract retenders, has been unaffected and continues as normal. For new cases, please contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:stafftransfers@gad.gov.uk">stafftransfers@gad.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Net take-home pay protection on staff transfers: Important information for Contracting Authorities</h2>

<p>Contracting Authorities should be aware of the following important information concerning the protection of take-home pay on transfers of staff:</p>

<p><span class="attachment-inline"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1020966/Broad_Comparability-_net_take-home_pay_test_September_2021.pdf">Fair Deal: A note by <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> on take-home pay protection for transfers of staff between public service pension schemes</a> (<span class="type"><abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class="file-size">125 KB</span>, <span class="page-length" lang="en">2 pages</span>)</span></p>

<h2>New Fair Deal guidance</h2>

<p>The government published the new Fair Deal policy in October 2013. The old Fair Deal policy may still apply to a specific staff transfer if permitted by the new Fair Deal policy or if outside the coverage of the new Fair Deal policy.</p>

<p>In all cases, it is for the contracting authority/commissioners to determine whether the Fair Deal policy applies and, if so, whether a staff transfer is covered by old or new Fair Deal.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fair-deal-guidance-a-gad-technical-bulletin">New Fair Deal guidance - A <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> technical bulletin (9 October 2013)</a></p>

<h2>Broad comparability</h2>

<p>Broad comparability relates to the protection of transferring employees’ future pension rights.</p>

<p>The idea is to make sure that a new employer offers transferring staff a package of benefits in respect of future service with an overall value that is worth as much as they would have had, were they to have remained with their original employer. In addition, staff must not suffer a reduction in take home pay at the point of transfer, as a result of a higher member contribution rate, unless a compensatory pay uplift is given.</p>

<p>For a pension arrangement to be assessed as being “broadly comparable” to a public sector pension scheme, it does not need to offer identical benefits. However, it must offer the same range of benefits, with the same (or greater) overall value. A broad comparability assessment includes both quantitative and qualitative tests.</p>

<p>The principles on which broad comparability is assessed are set out in the policy guidance (see links in the “Government policy documents” and “Other documents” sections below).</p>

<p>If a transfer is under New Fair Deal, and members are transferring back to the public sector scheme that they would have been in had the members not be subject to any compulsory transfers of employment under Fair Deal, then a broad comparability assessment is normally not necessary. For further detail please contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:stafftransfers@gad.gov.uk">stafftransfers@gad.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>There are 2 alternative approaches to certifying broad comparability, namely an individual assessment or a ‘passport’.</p>

<h3>Individual assessment</h3>

<p>The pension scheme offered by the new employer is compared with the original public sector pension scheme in the context of the actual employees who will transfer as part of a specific contract. Once broad comparability is achieved, the new scheme will be certified as broadly comparable, but only for this specific transfer.</p>

<h3>Passport certificate</h3>

<p>The pension scheme offered by the new employer is compared with the relevant public service pension scheme, as it applies to a wide range of membership. Once broad comparability is achieved, the new scheme will be certified as broadly comparable, and, subject to any eligibility restrictions, could be used for any transfer where broad comparability against the relevant public sector scheme is required, for the life of the certificate.</p>

<p>A passport certificate is usually valid for a period of up to 2 years and during that period it can be used for different staff transfer exercises within its validity. Passport certificates may be withdrawn before expiry if, for example, there have been changes in the benefits of either the public service pension scheme or the new employer’s pension scheme. Further information is set out in: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/325462/_STT032__Changes_to_passport_certificate_system.pdf">Changes to the passport certificate system for broad comparability</a>.</p>

<p>As an alternative to having a client specific passport certificate, organisations may consider using one of the centralised multi-employer pension schemes specifically set up to provide pensions for former public service workers.</p>

<p>Passport certificates are allocated a unique reference number. Contracting authorities can check if a passport remains in force by referring to ‘in force’ passport list. The list is updated monthly and includes passport certificates held by centralised multi-employer pension schemes.</p>

<p>As at 26 August 2021, there are no valid passport certificates in force. If you require any further information please contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:stafftransfers@gad.gov.uk">stafftransfers@gad.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>All potential clients of <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> should note that <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> charges fees for the assessment and certification of broad comparability. These fees are discussed and agreed before work commences.</p>

<h2>Transfers of past service rights</h2>

<p>Contractors participating in a compulsory transfer of employment from the public sector are normally required to offer staff the option to transfer their accrued pension rights, in respect of past service, into their new pension scheme.</p>

<p><abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> represents public sector organisations in negotiations regarding the terms under which members’ accrued pension rights will be transferred.</p>

<p>Some public sector pension schemes take actuarial advice from other actuaries instead of <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr>, and, in that case, those other actuaries would normally negotiate the transfer terms.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>There are two distinct aspects to the transfer of pension rights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>negotiation of terms - this involves discussions between <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr> and the contractor’s actuary on the basis for calculating the transfer values, and the credits which would be granted to members in the receiving scheme.
<br><br>
</li>
  <li>calculation of transfer values - once agreement has been reached and the transfer of employment has taken place, employees will normally have a period of three months to decide whether to transfer their past service benefits or to leave them in their previous scheme. Once the members have made their decisions and the appropriate data have been collected, the calculation of the bulk transfer amount for those employees who have opted to transfer is made by <abbr title="Government Actuary's Department">GAD</abbr>, and checked by the receiving scheme’s actuary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Redundancy and injury benefits</h2>

<p>Some redundancy and injury benefits take the form of early retirement pensions or lump sums which are similar to the pension scheme benefits and are paid through similar channels.</p>

<p>The Cabinet Office has issued guidance on these benefits stressing that it is imperative that any public contract resulting in the transfer of staff stipulates clearly that all redundancy benefits and options are taken on by the new employer.</p>
