<p>Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-5-youth-mobility">applying for a Youth Mobility Scheme visa</a>.</p>

<h3>Your partner and children</h3>

<p>You’ll need to check if your visa allows you to bring your partner and children (‘dependants’) with you. Not all routes allow this.</p>

<p>If your visa allows you to bring your partner and children with you, you’ll need to show either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your partner and children have enough money to support themselves</li>
  <li>the sponsor or endorsing body agree to support them financially or pay for their accommodation to at least the same amount</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to show you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£285 for your partner</li>
  <li>£315 for your first dependent child</li>
  <li>£200 for any other dependent child</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to show this amount of money in addition to the funds you need as the main applicant.</p>

<h2>Types of funds you can rely on</h2>

<p>You can show you have enough money using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a certificate of sponsorship (for some routes the sponsor must be A-rated to do this)</li>
  <li>a letter of endorsement if you’re on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/start-up-visa">Start-up</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/innovator-visa">Innovator</a> routes</li>
  <li>your own money</li>
  <li>your partner’s money if your partner is in the UK with permission or applying at the same time</li>
  <li>your parent’s money if you’re a child dependant</li>
</ul>

<h2>What evidence is not accepted?</h2>

<p>The following are examples of what is not accepted as evidence to show you have the required amount of money:</p>

<ul>
  <li>overdrafts</li>
  <li>bitcoin savings</li>
  <li>stocks and shares</li>
  <li>pensions</li>
  <li>bank accounts that are not regulated by the financial regulatory body in the country you’re applying from</li>
  <li>bank accounts that don’t use electronic record keeping</li>
</ul>

<h2>Control of the funds</h2>

<p>You, or the account holder (such as your parents or partner), must have control of the funds you are relying on.</p>

<p>You must show the funds have been held for 28 days, unless you are relying on your sponsor or endorsing body.</p>

<p>The bank statement(s) or evidence you use to show the funds have been held for 28 days must be from the 31 days before you submit your application. The 28 days is calculated from the date of the last transaction in the last dated bank statement.</p>

<h2>Evidence you need to provide</h2>

<h3>If your sponsor is financially supporting you</h3>

<p>Your sponsor will confirm that they have agreed to financially support you on the certificate of sponsorship you submit in your application.</p>

<h3>If your endorsing body confirms you have funding</h3>

<p>You must show an endorsement letter from the endorsing body confirming you have been awarded enough funds.</p>

<h3>If you’re using your own money</h3>

<p>If you’re not being financially sponsored, your funds can be held in any form of personal or building society account including a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>current account</li>
  <li>deposit account</li>
  <li>savings account</li>
  <li>pension savings</li>
  <li>investment account</li>
</ul>

<p>Cash must be in an account that allows you immediate access.</p>

<p>Funds must have been acquired legally and if you were in the UK you must not have earned them when working illegally.</p>

<p>If you’re using your own money, or that of a parent or partner you’ll need to show you have the required amount of money in an account. You can provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bank statements</li>
  <li>building society passbooks</li>
  <li>certificates of deposit</li>
  <li>a letter from your bank or building society</li>
</ul>

<p>Your bank statement should show information like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date it was issued</li>
  <li>your name (or the account holders name if it is your parent or partner)</li>
  <li>the name of the bank or building society</li>
  <li>balance on the account</li>
</ul>

<p>You can provide a download of electronic bank statements if it has this information. You do not need to have these stamped by the bank.</p>

<p>We may do verification checks with your bank. If we’re unable to verify the funds your application may be refused.</p>

<p>Your bank must be regulated by the appropriate regulatory body for the country in which it is operating.</p>

<h3>Money in other currencies</h3>

<p>If your money is held in a foreign currency this will be converted into pound sterling (£) using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter" rel="external">spot exchange rate on OANDA</a> for the date of the application.</p>
