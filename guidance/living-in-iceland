<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may wish to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iceland/entry-requirements">entry requirements</a> for Iceland.</p>

<p>You must register with <a rel="external" href="https://www.skra.is/english/individuals/">Registers Iceland</a> and apply for a national identification number (kennitala). You’ll need your <a rel="external" href="https://www.skra.is/english/individuals/me-and-my-family/my-registration/id-numbers/">identification number</a> to access services in Iceland.</p>

<h3 id="residency-and-visas-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Residency and visas after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>UK nationals living in Iceland must <a rel="external" href="https://skra.is/english/individuals/moving-to-iceland/i-am-an-eea-efta-citizen/">register their domicile with Registers Iceland</a> before the UK leaves the EU in order to be guaranteed a continuous right to reside in Iceland after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>More information can be found at the <a rel="external" href="http://www.utl.is/index.php/en/about-directorate-of-immigration/news/1009-information-for-british-citizens">Icelandic Government’s website</a>.</p>

<p>In the event of changes to residency rules or registration processes after the UK leaves the EU, we will update this page as soon as information is available. Sign up for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-iceland">email updates to this guidance on living in Iceland</a></p>

<h2 id="passports-and-travel">Passports and travel</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-renew-passport">apply for or renew your British passport</a> from Iceland. If you cannot get a passport in time for your trip, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<p>You can look at our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iceland">travel advice for Iceland</a> and sign up for up-to-date information on local laws and customs, safety and emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be new travel rules.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission has <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6402_en.htm">said you may not need visas for short stays</a> elsewhere in the Schengen area or the EU. You may be able to stay up to 90 days in any EU country, within a 180 day period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. In this time you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<h3 id="insurance-for-trips-to-iceland">Insurance for trips to Iceland</h3>
<p>If you are taking out travel insurance shortly after the UK leaves the EU, you should make sure you know the terms and conditions of your travel insurance policy. You should make sure that the policy covers any possible disruption.</p>

<p>If you already have travel insurance, your insurer should let you know if there are changes that will affect you when the UK leaves the EU. If you have questions about what your travel insurance policy covers, or whether it covers possible disruption, contact your insurer.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h2>
<p>Once you’re resident in Iceland for 6 months, you automatically become a member of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.sjukra.is/english/social-insurance-in-iceland/">Iceland social insurance system</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-iceland/">NHS guidance on who is able to access healthcare in Iceland and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Iceland and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>If you are resident in Iceland, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in Iceland.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>the EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home</li>
  <li>an EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance</li>
  <li>for more information you can read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">our travel advice pages</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">NHS guidance on healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in Iceland. You can bring personal prescription medicine for 100 days without a customs declaration, although Icelandic customs officials may ask for a formal doctor’s note.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/iceland-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners">find English-speaking doctors in Iceland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>The UK has reached an agreement with the EEA EFTA states on citizens’ rights in a no deal scenario. The deal protects the rights of UK nationals living in the EEA EFTA states and EEA EFTA nationals living in the UK if the UK leaves the EU without a deal and will enable them to continue living their lives broadly as they do now.</p>

<p>Social security coordination is covered by our citizens’ rights agreements for those residing in Iceland. Current healthcare arrangements will continue to apply in full to UK nationals who are resident in Iceland before the UK leaves the EU, for as long as they reside in Iceland.</p>

<p>This includes students and S1 holders, but not those using an EHIC card as these are for temporary travel.</p>

<p>The UK is working to ensure UK issued EHIC cards will continue to be accepted in EEA EFTA states. However, this would not currently be the case in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. It is important that persons travelling always purchase comprehensive healthcare insurance.</p>

<p>You can read the NHS guidance about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcareabroad/countryguide/Pages/healthcareinIceland.aspx">healthcare for UK nationals living in and visiting Iceland and how it may change after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-iceland">Working in Iceland</h2>

<p>You will need a <a rel="external" href="https://www.skra.is/english/individuals/me-and-my-family/my-registration/id-numbers/">national identification number (kennitala)</a> to work in Iceland.</p>

<p>You should read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>Some jobs may require a <a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK criminal records check</a>, known as a DBS check.</p>

<h3 id="working-in-iceland-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in Iceland after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same during the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your right to work will stay the same if you register as a resident before the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If you have not registered as a resident, you must do so through <a rel="external" href="https://www.skra.is/english/individuals/">Registers Iceland</a> and apply for a national identification number (kennitala).</p>

<p>If you intend to arrive after the UK leaves the EU your right to work may be different. Please see the <a rel="external" href="http://www.utl.is/index.php/en/">Directorate of Immigration</a> for the latest information.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>You will be issued a tax card when you register with <a rel="external" href="https://www.skra.is/">Registers Iceland</a> and get a national identification number.</p>

<p>The UK has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/iceland-tax-treaties">double-taxation agreement</a> with Iceland to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">if you leave the UK to live abroad</a></li>

</ul>

<p>You can read the Icelandic government’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="http://old.mcc.is/english/finances/taxes/">taxes in Iceland</a>. You may also want to look at the <a rel="external" href="https://www.rsk.is/english/individuals/">Icelandic Directorate of Internal Revenue</a>.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>
<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while you are abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>
<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in Iceland.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the European Union will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in Iceland. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in Iceland, you can claim:</p>
