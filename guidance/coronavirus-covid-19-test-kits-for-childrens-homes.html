<p>Settings may also wish to consider reading guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-asymptomatic-testing-in-schools-and-colleges" class="govuk-link">asymptomatic testing: secondary schools and colleges</a>.</p>

<h2>Open children’s homes – testing options</h2>

<p>If you are an open children’s home, <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>symptomatic testing of staff and children</li>
  <li>confirmation of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kits can be used for regular asymptomatic testing of children in open residential homes who are not routinely able to attend school or are in-between schools and cannot access test kits otherwise from a school setting for subsequent at-home testing.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests should not be used for those showing symptoms.</p>

<h2>Secure children’s homes – testing options</h2>

<p>If you are a secure children’s home, <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>symptomatic testing of staff and children</li>
  <li>confirmation of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result</li>
  <li>testing upon entry into a secure children’s home for asymptomatic children as a means to reduce self- isolation periods</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kits can be used for asymptomatic testing of staff as part of a regular twice weekly pattern to detect COVID-19 cases and help break transmission in homes.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests should not be used for those showing symptoms.</p>

<h2>When to provide a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit</h2>

<h3>Open children’s homes</h3>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> COVID-19 test kits should only be offered to an individual who becomes symptomatic or to confirm a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test, and you believe they may have barriers to accessing testing through the usual channels. This type of testing should not be used for regular asymptomatic testing.</p>

<p>Anyone who has any COVID-19 symptoms must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> COVID-19 test</a> at a testing site, or order a test online at home and self-isolate immediately according to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">government guidelines</a>. This applies even if they recently had a negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result or had received a vaccination. This includes those working and living in children’s homes.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, when you do not think a symptomatic child or staff member would be able to access testing by the usual routes, you should consider providing a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit to improve the chances that the individual will get tested more quickly.</p>

<p>Access to these tests will also help symptomatic staff who test negative, and are not close contacts of confirmed cases, to get back to work as soon as they feel well enough. It can also support more rapid identification and isolation of contacts if the test is positive and release the need to socially isolate after a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> if the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> returns a negative result.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits will be supplied in boxes of 10 (a maximum of 3 for each order). Full instructions on how to administer the test and what to do next are provided within each kit.</p>

<p>Children’s home managers can decide how to distribute <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits to staff, as long as it is done safely with due regard for the transmission risk.</p>

<p>You could distribute <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>post to the staff member’s home</li>
  <li>asking another member of staff to drop the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kit through their letterbox</li>
</ul>

<p>A staff member who develops symptoms cannot enter the children’s home to collect a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit (or for any other reason). <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits are suitable for people of all ages, however, carers and guardians need to administer the test to those aged 11 and under.</p>

<p>The child’s social worker and setting manager are best placed to agree on who should help the child with administering a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, where required, taking into account the child’s own views.</p>

<h3>Secure children’s homes</h3>

<p>In addition to testing staff who become symptomatic, or receive a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test, children entering the home for the first time should be tested using a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kit on the day of arrival (day 0 or 1) and then tested again around 5 to 7 days after arriving at the home. Specific guidance about <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing on entry is available on the document sharing platform. The child may move out of isolation following 2 negative test results. If testing on reception is not available, the child is unable to test, or if they refuse to be tested, then they must complete 10 days isolation.</p>

<p>Within secure children’s homes, a trained member of residential staff needs to administer the taking of a swab test, regardless of the child’s age.</p>

<p>If a child entering the home is a close contact of a confirmed case, they will need to complete the full isolation period regardless of any test results received.</p>

<p>If a child or adult has recently (within 90 days) had a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for COVID-19, they are likely to have developed some immunity. The child should not undertake a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test (unless they develop new symptoms) and will have to complete the 10 days of isolation.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits will be supplied in boxes of 10 (a maximum of 3 for each order). Full instructions on how to administer the test and what to do next are provided within each kit.</p>

<p>If you are a secure children’s home manager then you need to follow the guidance as set out in the Clinical Standard Operating Procedure (<abbr title="standard operating procedure">SOP</abbr>): Testing Upon Entry in Secure Children’s Homes.</p>

<p>The child’s social worker and setting manager are best placed to agree on who should help the child with administering a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, where required, taking into account the child’s own views.</p>

<h2>When to provide an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kit</h2>

<p>It is crucial that action continues to be taken to break chains of transmission of COVID-19, and help safeguard the health of the staff and residents of children’s social care settings. Up to one in 3 people who have coronavirus are asymptomatic. By rapidly identifying and containing asymptomatic cases, we can help reduce transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Testing is in addition to and does not replace, other protective measures such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>social distancing</li>
  <li>handwashing</li>
  <li>wearing face coverings</li>
  <li>ensuring good respiratory hygiene (promoting the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach)</li>
  <li>maintaining enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often using standard products such as detergents</li>
  <li>keeping occupied spaces well ventilated where appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing is voluntary and no person will be tested unless informed consent has been given by the appropriate person. However, we strongly encourage testing to take place, wherever it is possible to do so.</p>

<p>The child’s social worker and setting manager are best placed to agree on who should help the child with administering an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test, where required, taking into account the child’s own views.</p>

<p>The asymptomatic testing programme does not replace the current testing policy for those with symptoms. Those with symptoms and their close contacts should still self-isolate immediately, take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and follow government guidelines, even if they recently had a negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result.</p>

<h3>Open children’s homes</h3>

<h4>Staff</h4>

<p>Staff working in open children’s homes can now directly access <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits through the government’s wider asymptomatic testing programme. Advice is that asymptomatic testing should be undertaken twice a week, with a gap of 3 to 4 days between each test, so that individuals are able to establish if they could be infected with the COVID-19 virus. All staff should therefore conduct an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> at home prior to attending their workplace.</p>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">regular rapid COVID-19 tests if you do not have symptoms</a>.</p>

<p>Test results should be uploaded to the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">COVID-19 results portal</a> and individuals will receive an email or text confirming the result of their test and guidance on the next steps.</p>

<p>Full instructions on how to administer the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and what to do next are provided within each kit.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test will give a result in around 30 minutes, and staff should share their result with their children’s home setting to help with contact tracing. Results need to be reported to NHS Test and Trace, as soon as the test is completed, whether the result is positive, negative or void. Testing is not mandatory for staff, and staff do not need to provide proof of a negative test result to attend the workplace, although participation in testing is strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kits can be used for regular asymptomatic testing of secondary school-aged children in open residential homes who are not routinely able to attend school, or are in-between schools and cannot access test kits otherwise from a school setting for subsequent at-home testing. This can apply to individual children until such time as they are able to join the regular schools testing programme. Anyone with a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should get a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you are a children’s home manager, then you need to follow the guidance as set out in the Clinical Standard Operating Procedure (<abbr title="standard operating procedure">SOP</abbr>): Rapid Asymptomatic Testing for residents in open children’s homes.</p>

<p>When undertaking a test, a member of the children’s home staff or guardian will need to administer the test to any child aged 11 and upload their test result.</p>

<p>A member of children’s home staff or a guardian will need to supervise children aged 12 to 17 to self-test and upload their test results (although an adult can conduct the test and upload the results if necessary).</p>

<p>Young people aged 18 will be able to self-test without supervision where this is suitable.</p>

<p>For each order, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits will be supplied in sets of 140 (20 boxes of 7 Innova kits) at a time, for each children’s home, and can be replenished every 21 days.</p>

<h3>Secure children’s homes</h3>

<h4>Staff</h4>

<p>Staff working in secure children’s homes should be provided with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kits to take home and carry out the test twice a week, 3 to 4 days apart, preferably in the morning. Tests should be taken before going to the workplace, to minimise the risk of introducing infection, and be evenly spaced throughout the week. Staff returning to work after a period of leave should take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test at the beginning of their shift. Part-time workers should still broadly space their 2 tests throughout the week.</p>

<p>For each order, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits will be supplied in sets of 140 (20 boxes of 7 Innova kits) at a time, for each children’s home, and can be replenished every 21 days.</p>

<h2>Consent to testing of children</h2>

<p>For looked-after secondary school-aged children, the children’s home manager should in all cases get consent from the person or body who holds parental responsibility, via the placing authority, for the child’s participation.</p>

<p>Young people 16 years or over, who are able to provide informed consent, can complete the consent form, which is available on the document sharing platform. Home managers will provide the form to the young person.</p>

<p>For children younger than 16, or young people who are unable to give informed consent due to lack of mental capacity, informed consent will need to be obtained from the appropriate guardian or relevant responsible person from the child’s placing local authority. One consent form for each child participating in testing should be completed.</p>

<p>If the child refuses, testing should not take place even if informed consent has been given by the appropriate guardian.</p>

<p>Children’s home managers should liaise with the placing local authority and consult the care plan for individual children as regards the types of decision, which might include testing and receiving test results, that can be taken on behalf of children.</p>

<h2>Consent to testing of staff</h2>

<p>Participation is voluntary for self-testing at home. Anyone participating in testing must be provided with all necessary information to help them make the decision to self-test. Secure children’s homes must make sure that staff are issued with the privacy notice for tests at home.</p>

<p>Children’s home managers need to follow the guidance as set out in the Clinical Standard Operating Procedure (<abbr title="standard operating procedure">SOP</abbr>): Rapid Asymptomatic Testing of Secure Children’s Homes Staff at Home, which is available on the document sharing platform.</p>

<h2>Ordering and replenishing test kits</h2>

<p>All children’s homes registered on the national testing portal can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">order more test kits online</a>.</p>

<p>You can order new <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kits 21 days after you receive a delivery confirmation email telling you that your previous order has been sent.</p>

<p>To place an order, you will need a unique organisation number. You should receive an email with this number once your account has been approved.</p>

<p>You can look up your <a rel="external" href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">unique organisation reference number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</a> using your Ofsted unique reference number.</p>

<p>For coronavirus related queries, you can phone the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> coronavirus helpline on 0800 046 8687 (open Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm).</p>

<p>If you do not receive your supplies of test kits, we advise you to contact the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> coronavirus helpline on 0800 046 8687 (open Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm).</p>

<h2>Action following <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results</h2>

<h3>Positive results involving staff</h3>

<p>If a member of staff (and close contact) has a positive result from a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, they must self-isolate immediately and continue to isolate for at least 10 days from when their symptoms started. Everyone in their household or support bubble must also isolate for 10 days from the day after the individual tested positive. Where the staff member was at work during their infectious period, settings should also contact the local health protection team.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">guidance for households with possible COVID-19 infection</a>.</p>

<h3>Positive results involving children</h3>

<p>If a child living in the setting (including children newly arriving into a secure children’s home) has a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, they must self-isolate immediately within the setting, as far as they are able to, for at least 10 days from when their symptoms started. Everyone in their household or support bubble must also isolate for 10 days from the day after the individual tested positive. Settings should contact their local health protection team who can support conducting a risk assessment to identify who in the setting should be included within the child’s household or bubble for self-isolation.</p>

<p>Staff should wear the appropriate level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as set out in the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#what-care-should-be-taken-in-residential-settings-including-residential-schools-residential-special-schools-and-childrens-care-homes" class="govuk-link">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care settings, including the use of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace should escalate cases in members of staff or children to local health protection teams (for a ‘tier 1’ response) when they are notified that the case is connected to a children’s home. Public health experts will then carry out the contact tracing and any necessary follow up. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team">local <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> health protection team</a> should carry out a risk assessment of the setting to decide what action should be taken.</p>

<h3>Negative results</h3>

<p>If a member of staff or child has a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result, it means the test did not find COVID-19.</p>

<p>At that point, they no longer need to self-isolate and can return to work or education, as long as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>everyone they live with who has symptoms tests negative</li>
  <li>everyone in their support bubble who has symptoms tests negative</li>
  <li>they were not told to self-isolate for 10 days by NHS Test and Trace (unless the instruction has been withdrawn by local public health officials)</li>
  <li>they feel well - if not, they should stay at home until they feel better</li>
</ul>

<p>For children entering into a secure home who are tested using <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits, only the second negative test on day 5 to 7 will mean that they no longer need to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Regardless of any test result, members of staff and children should continue to isolate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have been in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">close contact with a confirmed positive case</a>, or have been told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace (unless the instruction has been withdrawn by local public health officials)</li>
  <li>a member of their household or support bubble is symptomatic</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because they may still develop symptoms during the isolation period.</p>

<p>More information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/what-your-test-result-means/" class="govuk-link">what test results mean</a> is available on the NHS website.</p>

<h2>Action following <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results</h2>

<h3>Positive results</h3>

<p>If a child or member of staff has a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result, the individual and their household should self-isolate immediately and they should have a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 2 days of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test. If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is positive, they will need to continue to isolate along with their household for 10 days. The isolation period includes the day the test was taken and the next 10 full days. If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> returns a negative result within 2 days of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result, the self-isolation period can end so long as no symptoms are displayed.</p>

<h3>Negative results</h3>

<p>If a member of staff or child has a negative result, it is likely they were not infectious at the time the test was taken. A negative test result, however, is not a guarantee that an individual does not have COVID-19.</p>

<p>If the test is negative, children’s home managers must continue to follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="govuk-link">national guidelines</a> for safe working in children’s social care including regular handwashing, social distancing and face coverings in the setting, where required.</p>

<p>Regardless of any test result, members of staff and children should continue to isolate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have been in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">close contact with a confirmed positive case</a>, or have been told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace (unless the instruction has been withdrawn by local public health officials)</li>
  <li>a member of their household or support bubble is symptomatic</li>
</ul>

<p>All test results, whether positive, negative or void, need to be uploaded via the self-test reporting portal or by calling 119.</p>

<p>More information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/what-your-test-result-means/" class="govuk-link">what test results mean</a> is available on the NHS website.</p>

<h2>Registering completed test kits and receiving results</h2>

<p>When registering your completed test kits you will need to give details of the person being tested. This includes their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>symptoms (if any) and the date they started</li>
  <li>ethnic group</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>email address and mobile number that the results will be sent to</li>
  <li>employment status (optional)</li>
  <li>NHS number (if known)</li>
</ul>

<p>The home manager should register the completed test kits for any children in your care.</p>

<p>Children aged 11 must be assisted by an appropriate adult and the results should be reported on the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> self-test portal by the appropriate adult using the home <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>.</p>

<p>Children aged 12 to 17 may self-test with supervision and can report the results on the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> self-test portal using the home <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> with adult oversight.</p>

<p>Anyone 18 years and above may self-test without supervision where this is suitable, and report results on the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> self-test portal using the home <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>.</p>

<p>Children’s home managers should share the results of a child’s test with the placing local authority and local authority where the home is located (if different).</p>

<p>Children’s home managers should also ask members of staff to share the results of their at-home test immediately.</p>

<h2>Storage of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kits</h2>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kits should be stored securely at ambient room temperature (5 to 22°C).</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits should be stored securely at ambient room temperature (2 to 30°C).</p>
