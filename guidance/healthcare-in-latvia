<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>
</div>

<p>This content was originally published on the NHS website.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-latvia">Healthcare in Latvia after Brexit</h2>
<p>You should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national living in Latvia.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Latvia in place.</p>

<p>For example, if you are a posted worker or student using a <a href="#ehic">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a> you will not be able to use this to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<p>The Latvian government has adopted <a rel="external" href="https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/305836-on-judicial-cooperation-and-protection-of-persons-rights-during-the-transition-period-after-the-withdrawal-of-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-from-the-european-union">no-deal legislation</a> in relation to the rights of UK citizens.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-live-or-work-in-latvia">If you live or work in Latvia</h3>
<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-latvia#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Latvia</a>. You can find more information on how to register on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.pmlp.gov.lv/en/home/services/residence-permits/">Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs</a> website</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<p>If you are a UK posted worker, you need to follow any announcements from the Latvian government on the ongoing domestic healthcare reform debate to see whether you will be able to buy into the state system to continue receiving the healthcare you need on the same terms as a Latvian national. If this is not possible, you may need to get private healthcare insurance.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>
<p>Your S1 certificate may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Latvia and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-latvia-after-brexit">Studying in Latvia after Brexit</h3>
<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Latvia and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Latvia before Brexit, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>
<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>
<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK if you are living in Latvia and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Latvia before Brexit, you can use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge when visiting the UK after exit day if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>
<p>If you return to the UK permanently and meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessing-ordinary-residence-nationality-policy-guidance">ordinarily resident</a> test you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="ehic">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>
<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Latvia and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Denmark.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need. 
If you have any pre-existing conditions, talk with your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>UK-issued <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">EHICs</a> will still be valid until the UK leaves the EU. Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can also be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>

<p>You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Latvia. If you have an S1 certificate, it will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit. You can find more information under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<h3 id="pre-existing-health-conditions">Pre-existing health conditions</h3>
<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Latvia if you have a pre-existing health condition. You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have, so that you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medicine with you.</p>
