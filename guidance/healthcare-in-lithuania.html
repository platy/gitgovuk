<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Lithuania.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/world/living-in-lithuania" class="govuk-link">Sign up for email alerts</a></p>
</div>

<p>This information is about living in Lithuania. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Lithuania.</a></p>

<p>Lithuanian residents usually pay into the national health insurance scheme called Privalomasis Sveikatos Draudimas (<abbr title="Privalomasis Sveikatos Draudimas">PSD</abbr>). Medical care is mostly free for people covered by the scheme.</p>

<p>Healthcare is managed by a national health insurance fund and Territorial Health Insurance Funds (THIF) in each of the 5 regions of Lithuania, using funds from <abbr title="Privalomasis Sveikatos Draudimas">PSD</abbr>.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Lithuanian healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registering as a resident and paying into the national health insurance scheme</li>
  <li>using a European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) or UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">S1 form</a> with one of the insurance funds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Lithuania</h2>
<p>You need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-lithuania#visas-and-residency" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> before signing up to pay into the national health insurance scheme.</p>

<p>If you’re employed by a Lithuanian employer they will automatically enroll you on to the national health insurance scheme. Your dependants will be covered too.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not working, you need to join the national health insurance scheme directly.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a Lithuanian <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK.</p>

<p>You may also have the right to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#s1">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<h3>How to register</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-lithuania" class="govuk-link">Apply for temporary or permanent residency</a>. You’ll need to apply online then visit a Migration Department office. <a href="https://www.migracija.lt/en/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Find out what documents you need</a>.</p>

<p>Sign up to the national health insurance scheme (<abbr title="Privalomasis Sveikatos Draudimas">PSD</abbr>). Your employer will enrol you and arrange for contributions to come out of your salary.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not working, you need to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.sodra.lt/en/benefits/information-for-insurers/i-want-to-pay-my-contributions/i-am-engaged-in-individual-activities">sign up to pay contributions</a>.</p>

<p>You can choose your GP from a list of health centres in your municipality.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>You need to pay the national insurance fund around 508 euros a year or around 42 euros a month.</p>

<p>If you’re employed, this will be taken directly out of your salary.</p>

<p>Healthcare services and treatment are free. You may need to pay towards some prescription medicines.</p>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Lithuania temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers can access healthcare in Lithuania using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. This can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: using an S1 form in Lithuania</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-lithuania">Lithuanian resident</a> and receive a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>If you started living in Lithuania before 1 January 2021, you may also be entitled to an S1 if you receive some other ‘exportable benefits’.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Lithuanian system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Lithuania on the same basis as a Lithuanian citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/">planned treatments</a> in other EU countries</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Lithuania than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services  
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Lithuania</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 with your nearest Territorial Health Insurance Fund office. You’ll need 2 copies of your S1 form and proof of ID such as a passport.</p>

<p>Once registered,  you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Lithuanian citizen.</p>

<h2>Studying in Lithuania</h2>
<p>You can use an <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-ehic-european-health-insurance-card/" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr></a> to get medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes UK nationals who started living in the EU before 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
