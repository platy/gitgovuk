<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s Regulation 2019/502 on common rules ensuring basic air connectivity (‘the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation’) entered into force in March 2019. This Regulation provides the basis for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries to give <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines permission to operate if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without a deal.  Subject to some minor modifications, it also applies to Norway and Iceland through its incorporation into the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> Agreement.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s Regulation was originally intended to apply until the end of March 2020, but a proposal to extend this to October 2020 was announced by the European Commission on 4 September 2019. The rights the Regulation provide to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines are conditional on the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> granting equivalent rights to airlines from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries.</p>

<p>In March 2019, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> published a policy statement setting out the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> position on rights for airlines from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries to operate for the duration of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation. This statement was also intended to apply until end of March 2020. In order to provide more certainty for consumers and industry, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> also proposes to extend the period for which these contingency measures apply to cover the 2020 <abbr title="International Air Transport Association">IATA</abbr> summer season (which lasts until 24 October 2020), for air services between the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This proposal remains subject to reciprocity by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The revised statement is set out below.</p>

<p>The government will issue guidance to the Civil Aviation Authority (<abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr>) on the application of this policy statement to the granting of foreign carriers permits.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<p>The objectives underpinning the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> position on these contingency arrangements are threefold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to provide certainty and reassurance to industry and consumers</li>
  <li>to minimise potential for disruption to connectivity, especially in the short term</li>
  <li>to maintain the principle of a level playing field for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> industry in future negotiations</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will, subject to the necessary approvals and under the terms set out below, grant airlines licensed in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries a level of access to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> that is at least equivalent to the rights granted to <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation, for the period during which that Regulation applies (i.e. under current proposals, October 2020).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has also – for the duration of these contingency measures – chosen to take a more liberal approach than the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in a few select areas in order to ensure disruption for consumers is not the result of this <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> action.</p>

<p>However, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will start negotiations on future arrangements on the basis of equivalence and a level playing field.</p>

<p>The arrangements set out in this statement will also apply to Iceland and Norway, and so references throughout to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> airlines should be read accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="traffic-rights">Traffic rights</h2>

<p>Under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines will be entitled to fly across the territory of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and to make stops in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for non-traffic purposes (i.e. to refuel or carry out maintenance without embarking or disembarking passengers or cargo). <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines will be entitled to operate services without restriction between any pair of points, one of which is in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and the other in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State (the ‘third and fourth freedoms of the air’), and all-cargo services from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State and on to a country outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (beyond-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> ‘fifth freedom’ services) within a cap for up to 5 months from the date that the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to allow <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines to fly across the territory of the United Kingdom, and to make stops in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for non-traffic purposes. If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> were to reciprocate on this aspect of the Regulation on a purely symmetrical basis, it would mean granting third and fourth freedom rights to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines allowing them to operate between any pair of points, one of which is in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, and the other in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State in which the airline was licensed.</p>

<p>However, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has long taken the view that liberalised markets in air services promote choice and connectivity and are in the interests of consumers. As such, for the duration of these contingency measures the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to go further than symmetrical reciprocity and allow <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines to operate from any point in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> (seventh freedom traffic rights). It would still be for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State concerned to grant an operating authorisation to an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airline licensed in another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State to operate from its territory.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s position on reciprocity for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member States airlines on fifth-freedom all-cargo services beyond the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is set out below.</p>

<p>Consistent with the principle of reciprocity, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines operating to/from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> would be required to file their operational plans, programmes and schedules to the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> for approval alongside their application for a Foreign Carrier Permit.</p>

<p>Furthermore, authorisation to operate air services is granted by way of a foreign carrier permit in accordance with Article 250 of the Air Navigation Order 2016. In all cases authorisation would only be granted if the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airline complies with the Civil Aviation Authority’s published safety, security and other requirements. For scheduled services, Foreign Carrier Permits are generally provided on a seasonal basis, while for charter operations they may be granted either for a series, or as an individual permit for an ad hoc flight.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will start discussions on future air services on the basis of equivalence of traffic rights and a level playing field.</p>

<h2 id="ownership-and-control">Ownership and control</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has stated that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines licensed before the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will continue to be eligible for permission to operate provided that they are majority owned and effectively controlled by nationals of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and/or nationals of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries. For airlines newly licensed in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> after exit day to be eligible to operate, they will have to be majority owned and controlled by <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nationals.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> believes restrictions on airline ownership and control are outdated, and do not reflect the reality of the global capital markets and the basis on which investment is made. What matters is that an airline is safe, secure and properly regulated, not the nationality of its shareholders. Ownership and control restrictions simply constrain the ability of airlines to raise capital and structure themselves efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p>Therefore, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to take a more liberal approach for the duration of this contingency measure. Rather than require an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airline to be majority owned and controlled by nationals from that <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country, in order to be eligible to operate services between the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airline would instead need to satisfy the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> that they are majority owned and effectively controlled by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> nationals and/or nationals of other <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries and/or nationals of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will start discussions on future ownership and control arrangements from the perspective of a level playing field.</p>

<h2 id="all-cargo-services-beyond-the-uk">All cargo services beyond the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation, for up to 5 months after exit day, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines will be entitled to operate all-cargo services from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, to a point in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, and onwards to a third country. The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s Regulation would cap the number of such services that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines could operate at ‘2018 levels’.</p>

<p>In line with the principle of reciprocity, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to allow <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> airlines to operate all-cargo air services between any pair of points of which one is situated in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and the other is situated in a third country, as part of a service with origin or destination in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. The total seasonal capacity to be provided by EU27 airlines for those services would be limited to the total number of frequencies operated by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines in the <abbr title="International Air Transport Association">IATA</abbr> summer 2018 season on a pro-rata basis. Should the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation be amended to reflect summer 2019 frequencies then the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to reciprocate. Authorisations would be granted for up to 5 months.</p>

<h2 id="cabotage">Cabotage</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has been clear that <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines will no longer be able to operate intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> services including domestic (cabotage) services. The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s position remains that liberalised markets in air services (including air traffic rights such as cabotage) promote connectivity, choice and value for money for consumers. However, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> also has to ensure a level playing field and fair competition for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> businesses, and as such, airlines from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries will no longer have the automatic right to operate intra-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> services.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to ensure the continuation of connectivity within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> provided by scheduled air services and provide time for that market to adjust to these new arrangements, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to allow <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines to operate scheduled services wholly within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for the duration of the <abbr title="International Air Transport Association">IATA</abbr> Winter season 2019/20 (that is, up to 28 March 2020). In terms of the market adjustment required, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines operating such cabotage services would be able to continue air services wholly within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> beyond the start of the <abbr title="International Air Transport Association">IATA</abbr> 2020 summer season only if they establish an airline in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> with an operating licence issued by the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr>, or a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>/<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> agreement is reached allowing cabotage and intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> services for all <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will start discussions on the potential for future cabotage within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines from the perspective of a level playing field.</p>

<h2 id="leasing">Leasing</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation will allow <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines to operate using their own aircraft, aircraft leased without crew (‘dry lease’) from any lessor, or aircraft leased with crew (‘wet lease’) from another <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operator. However, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation goes on to stipulate that a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airline will only be able to operate using an aircraft wet leased from an airline of a state other than the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, if that lease could be justified on the grounds of exceptional needs, seasonal capacity needs or operational difficulties. As such the expectation under <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law is that a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airline would not wet lease an aircraft from a non-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airline without first considering whether another <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airline is able to provide the aircraft and crew.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> were to reciprocate this aspect of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation on a purely symmetrical basis, it would mean imposing an equivalent restriction on an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airline wishing to operate using aircraft leased with crew from an airline of an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State, other than the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State in which it is licensed. However, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has long taken the view that flexible, and safe wet leasing arrangements allow the market to operate smoothly and overcome short term difficulties that would otherwise cause disruption for consumers. As such, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to take a more flexible approach for the duration of this measure and allow <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines, subject to approval from the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr>, to operate to/from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> using aircraft wet leased from another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State.</p>

<p>Consequently, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to allow the following arrangements. <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> airlines would be able to operate to/from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> using their own aircraft, aircraft dry leased from any lessor, or aircraft wet leased from another operator. Nonetheless if an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> airline wishes to operate to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> using leased aircraft, it would need to seek approval from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> before doing so. Furthermore, where an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airline wishes to operate to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> using aircraft leased with crew from an operator licensed by a country that is not an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State, it would need to satisfy the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> that the wet lease is justified on the grounds of exceptional needs, seasonal capacity needs or operational difficulties of the airline and that the leasing does not exceed the duration which is strictly necessary to fulfil those needs or overcome those difficulties.</p>

<p>One exception to this would be if an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> airline sought to wet lease from a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> operator. Subject to the usual safety approvals, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to allow this without the need to satisfy the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> that it is justified on the grounds of exceptional needs, seasonal capacity needs or operational difficulties of the airline and that the leasing does not exceed the duration which is strictly necessary to fulfil those needs or overcome those difficulties. However, it should be noted that <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> airlines would also have to seek approval for such a wet lease from the competent authority in the relevant <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State, as required by Regulation 1008/2008.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> will start discussions on future wet leasing arrangements from the perspective of a level playing field.</p>

<h2 id="cooperative-marketing-arrangements">Cooperative marketing arrangements</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation sets out the ways in which <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines will be allowed to codeshare with other airlines on services to and from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. While <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines will be able to codeshare with airlines on their services to and from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, the provision does not include the ability for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines to codeshare with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines on services wholly within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or from points in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> to points beyond.</p>

<p>On a reciprocal basis, the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> intends to allow both <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines to act as either the marketing or the operating airline for any services operated between the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines already codesharing with <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines on services wholly within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> would be permitted to continue doing so. Any additional requests to codeshare – for instance on <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> domestic air services – would be subject to approval, in line with the principle of reciprocity. Any codeshare arrangements for air services falling outside the scope of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation would continue unaffected subject to the usual expectations of reciprocity.</p>

<p>Codesharing arrangements with third country airlines would not be affected by this statement.</p>

<h2 id="fair-competition">Fair competition</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulation empowers the Commission to monitor the competition between <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines for the duration of the Regulation. If the conditions are deemed to be unfair, the Commission can establish limits on the allowable capacity for <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines, or require <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries to refuse, suspend or revoke permission to operate. The circumstances in which the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> would take such measures would be if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> provided subsidies to its airlines, or failed to apply competition law or maintain an independent competition authority.</p>

<p>The Commission would also propose restrictions if the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s application of standards in safety, security, workers’ rights, passenger rights or the environment was deemed to be inferior to that in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will retain in domestic <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> law all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law in force on exit day, including law on the areas mentioned above.</p>

<p>In terms of reciprocal arrangements, the <abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr> will work jointly with the Department for Transport to monitor the treatment of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> airlines operating to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and ensure they are able to compete with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State airlines on a level playing field.
