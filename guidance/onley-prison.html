<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Onley</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with a prisoner during their time at Onley.</p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>
<p>Prisoners do not have phones in their rooms so they will always have to call you. To do this, they have to buy phone credits and use Pin phones on the wings when they are out of their rooms.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.
Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and to help keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>You can send emails to someone in Onley using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies from the prisoner.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends will need to download the Prison Video app, create an account, register all visitors and add the prisoner to their contact list.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
