<h2>Main messages</h2>

<p>Human trafficking involves the recruitment or movement of people for exploitation by the use of threat, force, fraud, or the abuse of vulnerability.</p>

<p>Trafficking is a crime that can occur across international borders or within a country. It often crosses multiple geographic and legal boundaries.</p>

<p>Men, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/womens-health-migrant-health-guide">women</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/childrens-health-migrant-health-guide">children</a> may be trafficked for various purposes. They include labour sectors (for example, agriculture, food processing, manufacturing, services), domestic servitude, forced begging and petty theft and sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>Individuals who have been trafficked are likely to experience <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27066701" rel="external">multiple physical and mental health risks</a> prior to, during and after their trafficking experiences, and many suffer acute and long-term health problems. Health consequences of human trafficking may include injuries, physical pain and illnesses, and sexual health problems. They may also include <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mental-health-migrant-health-guide">mental health</a> problems such as depression, anxiety, psychosis and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

<p>Women trafficked for sexual exploitation and domestic servitude report <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/womens-health-migrant-health-guide#violence-against-women-and-girls">high levels of sexual violence</a>. Men and women report high levels of symptoms of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-migrant-health-guide">sexually transmitted infections</a>.</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-entitlements-migrant-health-guide#gp-services">GP registration</a>, which does not require proof of address or immigration status</li>
  <li>use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/language-interpretation-migrant-health-guide">professional language interpreting services</a> and not family members, friends, children or accompanying person (for safeguarding reasons and to minimise risk of coercion)</li>
  <li>obtain a detailed medical history and sexual history from survivors or suspected victims of trafficking</li>
  <li>

  <li>apply <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assessing-new-patients-from-overseas-migrant-health-guide#trauma-informed-practice">trauma-informed approaches</a> to service provision</li>
  <li>collaborate with agencies outside of the health and social care sector to identify and coordinate good prevention and response mechanisms, as part of a broader <a class="govuk-link" href="https://view.genial.ly/60a4e9647da7bf0dbe16703e" rel="external">multi-system and public health approach</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Trafficking is a process comprising various stages, starting with recruitment and followed by travel and transit, destination and exploitation. The exploitation stage may also be followed by periods of detention or re-trafficking, and later by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>integration (if remaining at destination); or</li>
  <li>re-integration (if returned home)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each stage poses different risks to a trafficked personâ€™s health and wellbeing. They may be at risk of psychological, physical and sexual abuse, forced and coerced substance abuse, social restrictions, and manipulation. Other risks include economic exploitation and debt bondage, legal insecurity, occupational hazards, and abusive working and living conditions.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00290-4" rel="external">Potential health and wellbeing consequences include</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mental-health-migrant-health-guide">mental health</a> issues, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, <abbr title="post-traumatic stress disorder">PTSD</abbr>, suicide ideation, self-harm, somatic complaints, aggressive behaviour, memory loss and cognitive problems</li>
  <li>poor physical health, such as acute injuries, chronic physical pain, fatigue, exhaustion, poor nutrition, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-migrant-health-guide">sexually transmitted infections</a>, other sexual and reproductive health complications and unwanted pregnancy</li>
  <li>substance use or misuse, such as drug or alcohol addiction, overdose, self-harm, needle-introduced infection, and sleep problems</li>
  <li>social health consequences, such as feelings of isolation, loneliness, shame, guilt, social withdrawal and risk of re-trafficking</li>
  <li>occupational injuries and disease, such as bacterial and other infections, chemical burns, injury, musculoskeletal injury, exhaustion and poor nutrition</li>
  <li>marginalisation and social exclusion</li>
</ul>

<p>Individuals who have experienced human trafficking encounter many <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27672141" rel="external">barriers to primary care</a> both during and after  exploitation.</p>

<h2>Identifying human trafficking</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/8/e008682" rel="external">Up to 1 in 8 NHS professionals report previous contact with a person they knew or suspected had been trafficked</a>.</p>

<p>Trafficking is a hidden crime and it is rarely obvious that an individual has been trafficked. However, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-016-1538-8" rel="external">red flags</a> might include a combination of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>being a migrant in work commonly associated with trafficking (such as labour industries)</li>
  <li>signs and symptoms of abuse or trauma</li>
  <li>appearing fearful and untrusting and presence of a minder</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unseenuk.org/modern-slavery/spot-the-signs" rel="external">Unseenâ€™s guidance on the indicators of various forms of exploitation</a>.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://healtrafficking.org/2017/06/protocol-toolkit/" rel="external">HEAL Trafficking and Hope for Justiceâ€™s Protocol Toolkit for Developing a Response to Victims of Human Trafficking in Health Care Settings</a> for more information on how to conduct interviews with patients.</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/immigration/report-human-trafficking" rel="external">report suspected human trafficking in a number of ways</a>.</p>

<h2>Caring for people who have been trafficked</h2>

<p>How people respond to traumatic experiences can vary widely and can be influenced by cultural norms, age, education, gender and personal histories. As a result, there is no simple â€˜right wayâ€™ to approach and care for all trafficked persons. However, there are some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/gender-violence-health-centre" rel="external">ABCs of caring for people who have been trafficked</a>. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assure patient and provider safety by consulting with the patient before contacting other support services (such as the police) to be sure this is what they want</li>
  <li>avoid using the possibly trafficked personâ€™s family, friends or children for language interpreting interpretation. The perpetrator may pose as a relative or friend, and may accompanying a patient to their appointments</li>
  <li>be prepared with good referral options and procedures by having contact details for the main agencies to hand, so no time is wasted looking these up. Try to make referral as easy as possible by providing the trafficked person with contact names or referral letters</li>
  <li>create a clinical safe space for disclosure, discussion and decision-making by learning about the effects of traumatic events, and acknowledging and addressing abuse in informed and sensitive ways. Do your best to make the time and private space for individuals to disclose and describe events and concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>When caring for people who have been trafficked, you should also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assessing-new-patients-from-overseas-migrant-health-guide#trauma-informed-practice">trauma-informed approaches</a> to service provision</li>
  <li>use a patient-centred approach, which makes the patient central to the decision-making process and helps prevent disempowering or re-traumatising individuals who have been trafficked</li>
  <li>draw on approaches used for other vulnerable populations, such as victims of violence or torture, other migrants, sex workers (if relevant)</li>
  <li>consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.antislaverycommissioner.co.uk/media/1235/slavery-and-trafficking-survivor-care-standards.pdf" rel="external">age- and gender-related needs</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://view.genial.ly/60a4e9647da7bf0dbe16703e" rel="external">multi-agency and public health approach</a> is needed for modern slavery and human trafficking prevention and response. In some regions, the health sector is involved in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.antislaverycommissioner.co.uk/media/1186/collaborating-for-freedom_anti-slavery-partnerships-in-the-uk.pdf" rel="external">anti-slavery partnerships</a>. However, it is currently more common for NHS Trusts, <abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr>/<abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr>, national and local public health teams to be absent from the system-wide response. Healthcare professionals should collaborate with agencies outside of the health and social care sector to identify and coordinate good prevention and response mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Referral options</h2>

<h3>National Referral Mechanism referrals</h3>

<p>The UK has implemented a National Referral Mechanism (<abbr title="National Referral Mechanism">NRM</abbr>). The <abbr title="National Referral Mechanism">NRM</abbr> is a process by which potential victims of trafficking are formally identified and offered temporary government funding in the UK. After receiving support, a person who has no other rights to live in the UK, or who wants to leave the UK, will be supported to return to their country of origin. If a referred person is determined not to be a victim of trafficking and there are no other circumstances that would give them a right to live in the UK, they will be supported to return to their country of origin.</p>

<p>NHS professionals cannot refer directly into the <abbr title="National Referral Mechanism">NRM</abbr>, but with the patientâ€™s consent may <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/human-trafficking-migrant-health-guide#salvation-army">contact the Salvation Armyâ€™s referral helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>Other referral options</h3>

<p>A small number of charities provide support to victims of trafficking who have not been referred into the <abbr title="National Referral Mechanism">NRM</abbr>. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/human-trafficking-migrant-health-guide#modern-slavery">Modern Slavery Helpline</a> takes calls from potential victims and statutory professionals concerned about trafficking. They can advise on relevant services and referral options.</p>

<h3>Referral options for children</h3>

<p>NHS professionals concerned that a child or young person may have been trafficked have a legal obligation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow all child protection guidelines</li>
  <li>speak to their designated Child Protection Lead</li>
</ul>

<p>Out of hours, contact your local childrenâ€™s social services or police service, specifically highlighting your concern about child trafficking.</p>
