<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Croatia to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings. These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>Although Croatia isn’t in the Schengen area it still applies the 90-day rule, but it <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-permit">applies it differently</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>Croatia’s authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/visas/visa-requirements-overview/" rel="external">Croatia’s government</a> before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you’ll need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>

<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Croatia. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Croatia’s authorities or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa. This guide uses the same terms used in Croatia, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Croatia’s authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>Croatia is not in the Schengen area.</p>

<p>The Schengen area countries apply the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">90-day visa waiver rule</a> as a group. This means if you visit one or more of the Schengen area countries within a 180 day-period, it all counts towards the Schengen 90-day limit.</p>

<p>Croatia applies a separate 90-day limit. It doesn’t apply the 90 days as a group within the Schengen area countries.</p>

<p>This means you can spend up to 90 days in a 180-day period in other European countries and it won’t affect how long you can spend in Croatia. You’ll still be able to stay in Croatia visa-free for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.</p>

<p>You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Croatia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>going to court as witness</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs</li>
  <li>attending conferences (not presenting)</li>
  <li>attending board meetings</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>touring a company facility</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your entire stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Croatia’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>The following may not require a visa or permit in Croatia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those carrying out activities related to the incorporation and registration of a company or sole proprietorship (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://portor.gov.hr/index.php/o-obrtu/?lang=en" rel="external">‘craft business’ (obrt)</a>)</li>
  <li>those with an EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) permit from another country – the Croatian company must send a posted worker declaration to the Ministry of Labour, by email or post</li>
</ul>

<p>Exemptions are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be your EU ICT permit if you have one.</p>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Croatia’s embassy</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/visas/visa-requirements-overview/" rel="external">immigration authorities</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Croatia’s embassy</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/visas/visa-requirements-overview/" rel="external">immigration authorities</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>If you have a family they won’t be able to get dependant visas if you’re working in Croatia short term. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>Partners, and children under 18 may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mup.gov.hr/aliens-281621/stay-and-work/temporary-stay-for-the-purpose-of-family-reunification/281662" rel="external">join you if you have a long-term permit</a>.</p>

<h3>Registering short-term work and permits for long-term work</h3>

<p>If you’re working temporarily in Croatia for up to 90 days you need to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#registration">work registration certificate</a>.</p>

<p>You must apply for a long-term permit if you’re in Croatia because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring from a UK-based company to a Croatian branch</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a Croatian company in Croatia on a Croatian contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing services to a client in Croatia</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#invest">investing in or donating money to Croatia</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#research">conducting research work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#nomad">working in Croatia as a digital nomad</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Long-term permits are valid for up to 1 year depending on which one you need.</p>

<h2>Registering short-term work</h2>

<p>You need either a 30-day or 90-day work registration certificate depending on what work you’re carrying out in Croatia.</p>

<h3>30-day work registration certificate</h3>

<p>You need a 30-day certificate if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taking part in fairs or exhibitions where your employer is exhibiting</li>
  <li>a writer or performer in musicals, stage performances and dance, as well as accompanying reporters, organisational and technical staff</li>
  <li>a filmmaker for fashion editorials or commercial campaigns</li>
  <li>a reporter or organisational or technical crew at a sports event or competition</li>

  <li>carrying out professional training or education for employees in Croatia</li>
  <li>delivering, installing or servicing machinery and equipment as part of a contract or warranty</li>
  <li>carrying out funeral activities in line with the Croatian regulations</li>
</ul>

<h3>90-day certificate</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a service provider for tourism or a tourist agent</li>
  <li>a tourist agent of non-Croatian tourist agencies providing services under an agreement with a Croatian tourist agency</li>
  <li>a scientist on scientific and professional training, a scientific representative of an international organisation or a scientist who will be working on a scientific project that is of importance to Croatia</li>
  <li>an expert, teacher, lecturer or admin staff from a non-Croatian cultural, educational and scientific institution working as part of a cultural and educational cooperation program, or whose employer is in the same group as the Croatian company</li>
  <li>an accredited foreign correspondent or media reporter</li>
  <li>supervising or inspecting shipbuilding or overhaul and the production and installation of equipment or machinery being exported</li>
  <li>a registered crew member of a non-Croatian vessel</li>
  <li>an expert in cultural heritage protection, library and archive science</li>
  <li>lecturing at an organised professional seminar</li>
  <li>artists, writers, performers and technical staff participating in opera, ballet, theatre, concerts or other cultural activities</li>
  <li>artists, writers, performers and technical staff involved in the film and television industry</li>
  <li>artists, writers, technical crew members or other staff involved in high budget filmmaking</li>
  <li>implementing international agreements</li>
</ul>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract and be on UK payroll, or have a service agreement or offer with a client in Croatia</li>
  <li>have relevant professional experience</li>
</ul>

<p>A temporary stay and work registration certificate can take 3 to 5 days to get. It’s valid for up to 30 or 90 days per calendar year and you can’t extend in the same calendar year.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>You need to check with Croatia’s authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You or the Croatian company submit a work registration certificate application to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mup.gov.hr/police/police-administration/146" rel="external">local police station (MUP)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You or the Croatian company collect your work registration certificate from the local police station in Croatia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mup.gov.hr/police/police-administration/146" rel="external">register with the local police (MUP)</a> within 48 hours of arriving in Croatia.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Application documents</h3>

<p>Croatia’s authorities may request different documents at different stages of the process. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed application form</li>
  <li>UK passport, valid for 3 months after your intended departure date</li>
  <li>diploma or qualification certificate, if applicable</li>
  <li>work contract or service agreement for an independent and temporary work activity, if applicable</li>
  <li>statement issued by the regulator, if you’re working in a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://reguliraneprofesije.azvo.hr/en/professions/" rel="external">regulated profession</a>
</li>
  <li>employment contract or offer, service agreement or offer, if you’re working in academic teaching, or a highly qualified activity</li>
  <li>document issued by a sports federation certifying the practice of your referred sport, if applicable</li>
  <li>request letter from the Croatian company</li>
  <li>excerpt from the trade court register for the company in Croatia</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to check with Croatia’s authorities on the exact process. This is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You or your employer send a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mup.gov.hr/UserDocsImages//dokumenti/stranci//Obrazac%201a.pdf" rel="external">residence permit application</a> to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:radna.dozvola.zagreb@mup.hr">radna.dozvola.zagreb@mup.hr</a> or submit it in person at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mup.gov.hr/police/police-administration/146" rel="external">local police station (MUP)</a>, Croatian embassy or consulate.</p>
