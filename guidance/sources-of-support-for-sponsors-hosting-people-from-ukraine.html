<p>First, thank you for becoming a sponsor. You have saved lives, given hope, and offered sanctuary to people in desperate need. Most hosts find the experience rewarding, but we know some hosts are facing challenges they are not experienced with, in welcoming people into your home, so it’s a good idea to know where to find support.</p>

<p>As a sponsor your main source of information should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this page</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/homes-for-ukraine-scheme-frequently-asked-questions">frequently asked questions</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/welcome-a-guide-for-ukrainians-arriving-in-the-uk">a guide for people from Ukraine living in the UK</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to this official guidance, there are other sources of support, and this guide sets out how to find them. We will update this page regularly.</p>

<h2>Becoming a sponsor</h2>

<p>If you are thinking about becoming a sponsor, the government has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recognised-providers-organisations-who-can-help-uk-citizens-become-sponsors">published a list of Recognised Providers</a>. These are voluntary and community sector organisations that provide support, and help to link up sponsors with people coming to the UK from Ukraine.</p>

<h3>Toolkits for sponsors</h3>

<p>Organisations experienced in supporting new arrivals in the UK have produced toolkits to help new sponsors. These toolkits give a general overview and advice about being a sponsor and a host:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Training and advice</h3>

<h2>After your guests have arrived</h2>

<h3>Your wellbeing</h3>

<p>As a sponsor you might like to talk to and share things with others who are also sponsoring in your area. Your local authority or the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.augb.co.uk/" rel="external">(AUGB)</a> might be able to help you find a local peer support group. They also offer drop-in sessions or may be able to direct you to a local support group that does</p>

<p>We also know sponsorship works best when the responsibility for hosting and supporting guests is shared. This guide shows you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.northdevonwithukraine.co.uk/building-a-support-group" rel="external">How to build a support group</a> .</p>

<p>Sponsors and guests might need some time out or space from their living arrangement. This support varies across the country, but here are some good examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.augb.co.uk/" rel="external">Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain (AUGB)</a> offer drop-in sessions or may be able to direct you to a local support group that does</li>
  <li>Your local council may also have organised activities for children over the school holidays. Check their websites for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Supporting your guests to access public services</h4>

<p>Your guests can access public services and support around housing, there is more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/welcome-a-guide-for-ukrainians-arriving-in-the-uk">information in the welcome guide.</a></p>

<h4>Housing, private renting and homelessness</h4>

<p>Renting in the UK can be expensive and costs can vary depending on the region. London is the most expensive place to live followed by other major cities. People in these locations will often commute for an hour to get to and from work and live in smaller dwellings, often with no outside space.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice" rel="external">Shelter</a> is a charity in the UK that can provide advice about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>homelessness</li>
  <li>private renting</li>
  <li>social housing</li>
  <li>eviction</li>
  <li>tenancy deposits</li>
  <li>Benefits</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussing next steps</h2>
