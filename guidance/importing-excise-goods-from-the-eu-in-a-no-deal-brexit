<p>The UK will leave the EU on 31 October. This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit. It will be updated if anything changes, including if a deal is agreed.</p>

</div>

<p>After Brexit, imports of excise goods from the EU will be treated the same as imports from the rest of the world. This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-and-declaring-excise-goods-in-the-event-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal#in-uk">moving imported excise goods within the UK.</a></p>

<h2 id="importing-excise-duty-paid-goods">Importing excise duty paid goods</h2>

<p>After Brexit, you’ll not be able to use the following to import excise duty paid goods into the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document (<abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>EU distance-selling arrangements</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to complete a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-declarations-for-goods-brought-into-the-eu">customs declaration.</a></p>

<h2 id="importing-excise-duty-suspended-goods">Importing excise duty suspended goods</h2>

<p>If your excise goods are dispatched  from an EU member state  on or after Brexit, you must use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/import-export">relevant customs procedures</a> when they arrive at the place they enter the UK.</p>

<p>You can use transitional simplified procedures to import excise goods. This means you’ll be able to transport your goods into the UK without having to make a full customs declaration in advance.</p>

<p>To use transitional simplified procedures, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-for-simplified-import-procedures-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal">register for transitional simplified procedures</a>
</li>
  <li>to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-declarations-using-transitional-simplified-procedures#controlled-goods-procedure">controlled goods procedure</a>
</li>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-procedures-if-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-without-a-deal#dut-der">duty deferment account</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="moving-imported-excise-goods-within-the-uk">Moving imported excise goods within the UK</h2>

<p>You must use the Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) to move excise duty suspended goods from the place they enter the UK to their final destination.
You’ll need to appoint a registered consignor to move the goods, or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-and-declaring-excise-goods-in-the-event-the-uk-leaves-the-eu-with-no-deal#reg-con">become a registered consignor.</a></p>

<p>The registered consignor must complete and submit an electronic administrative document (<abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr>) through <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> before the movement takes place.This will generate a unique Administrative Reference Code (<abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr>) for that specific movement. The code must travel with the goods at all times.</p>

<p>You’ll need to supply the person accompanying the goods (for example, the driver of the vehicle transporting the goods) with a printed version of the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> or any other commercial document which clearly states the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Once the goods are received and checked into the excise warehouse, the warehousekeeper receiving them (the consignee) will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm that the goods have arrived</li>
  <li>complete and submit a ‘report of receipt’</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="become-a-registered-consignor">Become a registered consignor</h2>

<p>If you want to become a registered consignor, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-application-to-be-a-registered-consignor-ex72">apply to be a registered consigner</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/excise-movement-and-control-system-how-to-register-and-use">register to use the Excise Movement and Control System</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It can take up to 45 days to register, so you should appoint someone who is already a registered consignor to move your goods whilst your application is being approved.</p>

<h2 id="if-your-goods-are-dispatched-before-brexit-but-received-after-brexit">If your goods are dispatched before Brexit but received after Brexit</h2>

<p>You do not need to complete a UK customs declaration or pay customs duty in the UK if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods are travelling under a recognised excise scheme at that time</li>
  <li>you can show that the movement started before Brexit</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirements and any sanctions that may apply to these goods will be based on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">current UK excise legislation and duty points that apply to EU movements.</a></p>

<p>HMRC or Border Force may ask for evidence of the date and time your goods were dispatched. You can show this by providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for excise duty suspended goods - the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> or a commercial document containing the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>for excise duty paid goods, either:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">request to import excise goods bought duty paid in another EU member state</a> (HM4)</li>
      <li>the Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document (<abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr>) form</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot prove the date and time your goods were dispatched, the movement will be treated in the same way as one that started after 31 October 2019 and customs import procedures will apply.</p>

<h3 id="closing-movements-that-started-before-brexit-but-received-after-brexit">Closing movements that started before Brexit but received after Brexit</h3>

<p>If your goods arrive in the UK after Brexit but were dispatched from the EU before this time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you cannot use <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> to create reports of receipt</li>
  <li>the movement will remain open in the system</li>
  <li>you’ll need to provide a paper document to HMRC that includes the same information as an <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> report of receipt</li>
</ul>

<p>For excise duty paid goods, you must still approve and return copy 3 of the <abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr> to the EU business if they request it. Copy 1 stays with the dispatching business and copy 2 is kept by the UK receiving company.</p>
