<h2>Book and plan your visit to Birmingham Prison</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>January 2022 update</h3>

<p>HMP Birmingham is offering visits for family and friends. Visiting times and availability may change at short notice. You should <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact the prison direct for any queries</a>.</p>

<p>Visitors aged 12 and over need to take a lateral flow device test (LFD) before coming for their visit. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic#testing">Find out more here</a>.</p>

<p>There are a number of other ways to <a class="govuk-link" href="#keepintouch">contact someone in prison if you are unable to visit them</a>.</p>

<p>You can also contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/helpline" rel="external">Prisoners’ Families Helpline</a> on 0808 808 2003. You will not be able to book a visit using this number.</p>
</div>

<p>Birmingham is now offering <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-to-book-family-and-friends-visits">limited visits for family and friends</a> in line with coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>To ensure the safety of visitors, prisoners and staff, there are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic">strict guidelines which must be followed</a> during you visit.</p>

<p>At Birmingham, prisoners are responsible for booking their own visits. To be able to visit, they will need to add you to their visitor list first.</p>

<p>When they make a booking, you will receive a visiting order confirming the date and time of your visit. You will need to bring a copy of the visiting order and the <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-Birmingham">required ID</a> to your visit.</p>

<p>There may be a limit to the number of visits a prisoner can have. You can check this with Birmingham Prison when booking.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">Contact Birmingham Prison</a> if you have any questions about visiting.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a visitors car park, including spaces for Blue Badge holders.</p>

<h3>Entering Birmingham Prison</h3>

<p>All visitors, aged 16 or older must prove their identity before entering the prison. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/management-of-security-at-visits-policy-framework-open-estate/acceptable-forms-of-identification-id-when-visiting-a-prison-in-england-and-wales-annex-a">Read the list of acceptable forms of ID for all visitors.</a>.</p>

<p>All visitors will need to be given a pat-down search, including children. You may also be sniffed by security dogs.</p>

<p>Birmingham Prison has a strict dress code policy which means visitors should dress sensibly. You may be turned away if you are wearing items like vests, low-cut tops, high-cut shorts or dresses, ripped jeans, or anything with offensive patterns or slogans. See posters in the visitors centre and visitor waiting area for details.</p>

<p>There will be no refreshments available during your visit.</p>

<p>There are strict controls on what you can take into the prison. You will have to leave most of the things you have with you in a locker or with security. Pushchairs and car seats can be brought as far as the visitor waiting area.</p>

<p>You will be told the rules by an officer at the start of your visit. If you break the rules, your visit could be cancelled and you could be banned from visiting again.</p>

<h3>Visiting facilities</h3>

<p>Coronavirus restrictions mean there are currently no refreshments available during your visit and the childrens play area is not available to use.</p>

<h3>Family days</h3>

<p>There are no family days currently being run.</p>

<h2>Keep in touch with someone at Birmingham Prison</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can keep in touch with someone during their time at Birmingham Prison.</p>

<h3>Secure video calls</h3>

<p>Secure video calling is available at this prison. Family and friends need to download the purple visits app, create an account, register all visitors, and add the prisoner to their contact list. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-a-prisoner-using-a-video-call">Read more about how it works</a></p>

<h3>Phone calls</h3>

<p>Prisoners have phones in their rooms and are able to make calls every day between 7am and 11pm.</p>

<p>Phones do not accept incoming calls so they will always have to call you. They have to buy phone credits to do this.</p>

<p>They can phone anyone named on their list of friends and family. This list is checked by security when they first arrive so it may take a few days before they are able to call.</p>

<p>You can also exchange voicemails using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prisonvoicemail.com/" rel="external">Prison Voicemail service</a>.</p>

<p>Officers may listen to phone calls as a way of preventing crime and helping keep people safe.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>You can send emails to someone in Birmingham Prison using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.emailaprisoner.com/" rel="external">Email a Prisoner service</a>.</p>

<p>You might also be able to attach photos and receive replies, depending on the rules at Birmingham Prison.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>

<p>You can write at any time.</p>

<p>Include the prisoners name and prison number on the envelope.</p>

<p>If you do not know their prison number, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contacts">contact Birmingham Prison</a>.</p>

<p>All post apart from legal letters will be opened and checked by officers.</p>

<h2>Send money and gifts</h2>

<p>You can use the free and fast <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-prisoner-money">online service to send money to someone in prison</a>.</p>

<p>You can no longer send money by bank transfer, cheque, postal order or send cash by post.</p>

<p>If you cannot use the online service, you may be able to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://send-money-to-prisoner.service.gov.uk/help/apply-for-exemption/" rel="external">apply for an exemption</a> - for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unable to use a computer, a smart phone or the internet</li>
  <li>do not have a debit card</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow you to send money by post.</p>

<h3>Gifts and parcels</h3>

<p>Prisoners in Birmingham Prison have a list of approved items that can be given to them by family and friends.</p>

<p>Prisoners must first apply for permission to receive items. Birmingham Prison then sends the family member or friend an approved stamp to fix to their parcel.</p>

<p>Family and friends can then hand in the parcel before visits.</p>

<p>Items should be handed in to the property desk in the visitors centre.</p>

<p>You must have a visit booked for the time you hand anything in, otherwise it won’t be accepted.</p>

<p>Items are not normally accepted by post. However, a prisoner who is a foreign national or does not get visits can apply for permission for a family member or friend to send items in. These parcels must also be marked with an approved stamp. Birmingham Prison takes no responsibility for items sent in the post.</p>

<p>Make sure to include the prisoner’s name and prison number on parcels. All items will be opened and inspected by an officer.</p>

<p>Friends and families of prisoners are permitted to send books directly to their loved ones, or can order books from approved retailers, which can source and send the books on to prisoners.</p>

<p>For the full list of approved retailers, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incentives-policy-framework/incentives-policy-framework-annex-f-sending-and-handing-in-of-books-to-prisoners">HMPPS Incentives Policy, Annex F</a>.</p>
