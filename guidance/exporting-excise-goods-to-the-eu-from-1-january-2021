<p>From 1 January 2021, exports of excise goods from Great Britain to the EU will be treated the same as exports to the rest of the world. This includes <a href="#move-gb" class="govuk-link">moving excise goods to a place of export in Great Britain.</a></p>

<p>There may be different rules in respect of Northern Ireland movements after transition. These will be published at a later date.</p>

<h2 id="exporting-excise-duty-paid-goods">Exporting excise duty paid goods</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2021 you’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-declarations-and-the-national-export-system-export-procedures" class="govuk-link">submit an electronic export declaration</a>. If you’re a business, you may be able to recover the excise duty on the exported goods by <a href="#excise-claims" class="govuk-link">claiming excise duty drawback.</a></p>

<h2 id="exporting-excise-duty-suspended-goods">Exporting excise duty suspended goods</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2021 you cannot use the Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>) to move excise duty suspended goods directly from Great Britain to the EU. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-declarations-and-the-national-export-system-export-procedures" class="govuk-link">submit an electronic export declaration</a>. If you move goods without following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/customs-declarations-for-goods-taken-out-of-the-eu" class="govuk-link">relevant customs export procedures</a> at the place they are exported from, you may be liable for excise duty and penalties. Your goods may also be seized.</p>

<p>If you raise a movement on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> to an EU member state 7 days before 1 January 2021 with a dispatch date on or after 1 January 2021 the movement will be rejected by <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> and HMRC.</p>

<h2 id="move-gb">Moving excise duty suspended goods to the place of export from Great Britain</h2>

<p>You must use <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> to move excise duty suspended goods from within Great Britain to the place they are being exported from.</p>

<p>You’ll need to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the authorised warehousekeeper declares the movement on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> when the goods are held in excise duty suspension in their warehouse</li>
  <li>appoint a registered consignor to move the goods or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-excise-goods-from-the-eu-in-a-no-deal-brexit#reg-con" class="govuk-link">become a registered consignor</a> - when the goods are being released from a customs control for re-export</li>
</ul>

<p>The authorised warehousekeeper or registered consignor must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete and submit an electronic administrative document (<abbr title="electronic Administrative Document">eAD</abbr>) through <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> before the movement takes place</li>
  <li>get a unique Administrative Reference Code (<abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr>) for that specific movement (that <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> generates)</li>
  <li>complete a customs export declaration using the National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>) and enter the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> in box 40</li>
  <li>receive an ‘accepted for export’ notification on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> after the goods are cleared by customs - this should be generated if the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> matches the details in Box 40 of the customs export declaration</li>
  <li>receive a ‘report of export’ to ensure the export is closed on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> does not match the customs export declaration within 30 days of the customs export declaration being submitted, the warehousekeeper or registered consignor will receive a ‘rejected for export’ notification to remind them that the movement is still open on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. You’ll need to establish why this has happened and take corrective action.</p>

<p>Where excise warehouses are also approved for Local Clearance Procedures or Customs Supervised Exports they can continue to benefit from export simplifications and not record the movement on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>. This is on the condition that the excise movement guarantee reference is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197#sect13" class="govuk-link">included on the export declaration</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re exporting excise goods, you must ensure you submit a departure message to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> to achieve ICS60. This will ensure <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr> is updated to ‘Delivered’.</p>

<h2 id="if-youre-a-registered-excise-business-or-use-authorised-destinations">If you’re a registered excise business or use authorised destinations</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2021, the following registered excise businesses and some authorised destinations will no longer be authorised to receive or dispatch excise goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered consignee (including movements for direct delivery)</li>
  <li>temporary registered consignee</li>
  <li>unknown destination for energy products</li>
  <li>tax representative (for excise duty on distance sales from the EU)</li>
  <li>registered commercial importer</li>
  <li>unregistered commercial importer</li>
</ul>

<p>Movements to exempt consignees will also no longer be able to take place on <abbr title="Excise Movement Control System">EMCS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If this impacts your business, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-ready-brexit-check" class="govuk-link">take steps so that you can continue trading</a>.</p>

<h2 id="if-your-goods-are-dispatched-on-or-before-31-december-2020-but-received-on-or-after-1-january-2021">If your goods are dispatched on or before 31 December 2020 but received on or after 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>You do not need to complete a customs export declaration in Great Britain if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods are travelling under a recognised excise scheme at that time</li>
  <li>you can show that the movement started on or before 31 December 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>The export requirements and any sanctions that may apply to these goods will be based on the UK excise legislation and duty points that apply at the time the movement started.</p>

<p>HMRC or Border Force may ask for evidence of the date and time your goods were dispatched. You can show this by providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for excise duty suspended goods - the <abbr title="electronic Administrative Document">eAD</abbr> or a commercial document containing the <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>for excise duty paid goods, either:
    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4" class="govuk-link">request to import excise goods bought duty paid in an EU member state</a> (HM4)</li>
      <li>the Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document (<abbr title="Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document">SAAD</abbr>) form</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot prove the date and time your goods were dispatched, the movement will be treated in the same way as one that started on or after 1 January 2021 and customs export procedures will apply.</p>

<p>Guidance about closing duty suspended movements that started on or before 31 December 2020 but received on or after 1 January 2021 will be published at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="excise-claims">Excise duty drawback claims</h3>

<p>If you provide HMRC with an EX75 Notice of Intention (NOI) on or before 31 December 2020 but the drawback claim is made after this date, the way you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback" class="govuk-link">claim duty drawback</a> will change.</p>

<p>HMRC will provide more information about these changes before 1 January 2021.</p>
