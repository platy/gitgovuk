<p>This guidance will next be updated in the 2021/22 test cycle.</p>
</div>

<p>Schools must make review applications in the ‘Pupil results’ section of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">NCA tools</a>. The application section will be open from 7.30am on Tuesday 9 July 2019 until 11:59pm on Friday 19 July 2019.</p>

<p>A review is successful, and free of charge to the school, if it results in a change to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the pupil achieving the expected standard</li>
  <li>the pupil not meeting the expected standard</li>
  <li>2 or more marks to the raw score</li>
</ul>

<p>A scaled score calculator will be available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">NCA tools</a> from Tuesday 9 July 2019. Schools can use this when deciding whether to apply for a review. It will calculate what effect a change to the total raw score has on the scaled score awarded. Test materials and mark schemes are available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-practice-materials">practice materials</a> collection.</p>

<p>Please note we will only accept review applications made by schools that are authorised by the headteacher or a delegated senior member of staff. We will not accept applications from pupils, parents or governors.</p>

<h2>Applying for a review</h2>

<p>A user guide will be available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">NCA tools</a> from Tuesday 9 July 2019 to assist schools with the online application process.</p>

<h2>Types of review</h2>

<h3>Marking review query</h3>

<p>Schools can apply for a marking review for as many pupils as they wish if they consider there is a discrepancy between how the questions have been marked and the published mark scheme. We recommend that schools only submit a review application if it meets the criteria for a successful review.</p>

<p>You should be aware that a pupil’s total raw score and scaled score could go up or down as a result of a marking review.</p>

<p>Marking reviews can only be completed where a pupil has a result for every test paper for that subject.</p>

<h3>Clerical review query</h3>

<p>Schools can apply for a clerical review if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a test marked on paper has an error, such as an incorrect addition of the marks awarded</li>
  <li>a test script has been matched to the wrong pupil</li>
  <li>there is an error on the school attendance register – for example, an attendance code needs to be corrected</li>
</ul>

<p>Only acceptable changes to attendance registers can be made. For example, if a pupil has taken a test and their script has been sent for marking, their school cannot request that the attendance register is changed to indicate that the pupil was working below the standard of the test (marked as B).</p>

<h3>Charges</h3>

<p>The table below sets out when we would charge for a review and how much it costs per pupil, per subject.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Type of review</th>
      <th scope="col">When charges would apply</th>
      <th scope="col" style="text-align: right">Cost per pupil, per subject</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Marking review</td>
      <td>The review does not result in a change to the pupil achieving the expected standard, the pupil not meeting the expected standard, or a total raw score change by fewer than 2 marks.</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">£9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Clerical review</td>
      <td>The review does not correct a test script matched to the wrong pupil, or produces no change to the raw score or scaled score, or the assigned code for why the pupil has not taken the test.</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">£5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Where charges are applicable, our supplier, Pearson, will invoice your school once the review process is complete.</p>

<h2>The review process</h2>

<p>During a marking review, we check all test papers for that subject to make sure that the original application of the mark scheme was accurate and no clerical errors were made. For example, for mathematics, we check Paper 1: arithmetic, Paper 2: reasoning and Paper 3: reasoning.</p>

<p>A panel of experienced supervisory markers, who have achieved the highest quality marking standards throughout the marking period, complete review marking. Review markers are supervised and their work is sampled to ensure that the mark scheme for the subject they are reviewing is applied correctly and marking quality is maintained. If review markers do not apply the mark scheme as required, or do not adhere to the review procedures, they will be stopped from marking. In this situation, any review marking they have carried out will be reviewed again by another review marker.</p>

<p>Marks may be awarded or deducted following the review of a pupil’s test papers. As a result, a review can lead to an increase or decrease of the total raw score, which may affect the scaled score and the achievement of the expected standard.</p>

<h3>Tests marked on screen</h3>

<p>When applying for a subject review, we will ask you whether you have a marking or clerical query. For a clerical query, you will be asked to select from a list of possible queries. You will then be prompted to provide information about the potential error.</p>

<p>For marking reviews, we will review all test papers taken by the pupil for that subject. You have the option to select whether your query is for a particular question, or all questions on an individual test paper, or all test papers for that subject. You can then provide details about your query at a question or paper level.</p>

<p>Test scripts marked on screen will be reviewed on screen.</p>

<h3>Tests marked on paper</h3>

<p>We mark the following tests on paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all braille, enlarged print and modified large print versions of the tests</li>
  <li>test scripts that could not be scanned for on-screen marking – for example, due to the condition of the test scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>You must indicate whether you are applying for a marking review or clerical review. A marking review for tests marked on paper also includes a clerical review of the addition of marks.</p>

<p>When you apply for a review on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">NCA tools</a>, it will be clear which test papers, if any, were marked on paper. You need to return any papers to Pearson to review. If Pearson does not receive them by the deadline, Monday 29 July 2019, the review will be rejected.</p>

<p>Instructions about where to send test scripts and an address label for submitting them are available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">NCA tools</a>. You must send the original test scripts. We will not accept copies.</p>

<p>We will only consider review applications if a pupil’s test script has not been amended or annotated in any way following marking (including circling the evidence for review or adding sticky notes to the test script). This is so the review panel can reach an impartial judgement. Schools can provide comments as part of the review application at both question and paper level.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to reject review applications, without giving any further reason, if a school has made amendments of any kind to a pupil’s test script.</p>

<h2>Review outcomes</h2>

<p>We will inform you of the outcome of your review on Wednesday 11 September 2019. We will amend pupil results on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">NCA tools</a> to reflect the outcome of the reviews.</p>

<p>A letter confirming the outcome of your review application, a notification of changes sheet and a marking review report will be available for each review application. Each of these contains important information about your review. The marking review report is completed by the review marker who checked your school’s test scripts. This will contain information about the marking for all pupils’ scripts submitted for a marking review.</p>

<p>You will be able to access the reviewed test scripts in the ‘Pupil results’ section of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ncatools.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">NCA tools</a> using the ‘Test scripts and reviews’ tab. This will show the original marks with the review marks alongside, circled in blue.</p>

<p>If you send test scripts marked on paper for review, we will return them to your school by Wednesday 11 September 2019.</p>

<p>Where a mark is changed through the review process, the scaled score derived from the reviewed mark will not be taken into account in the provisional school level performance measures until after the school <a class="govuk-link" href="https://tableschecking.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">checking exercise</a> takes place in September.</p>
