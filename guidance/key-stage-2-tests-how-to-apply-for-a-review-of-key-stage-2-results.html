<p>Schools can make review applications using the ‘View and download KS2 test results’ form in the ‘Available activity’ section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.primaryassessmentgateway.education.gov.uk/publicaccessproduction/selfservice/citizenportal/login.htm" rel="external">Primary Assessment Gateway</a>. The form will be available from 7.30am Tuesday 5 July 2022 until the deadline 11.59pm Friday 22 July 2022.</p>

<p>A review is successful, and free of charge to the school, if it results in a change to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the pupil achieving the expected standard</li>
  <li>the pupil not meeting the expected standard</li>
  <li>2 or more marks to the raw score</li>
</ul>

<p>A raw score to scaled score calculator will be available within the ‘View and download KS2 test results’ form. Schools can use this when deciding whether to apply for a review. It will calculate what effect a change to the total raw score has on the scaled score awarded. Test materials and mark schemes are available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-practice-materials">practice materials</a> collection.</p>

<p>Please note we will only accept review applications made by schools that are authorised by the head teacher or a delegated senior member of staff. We will not accept applications from pupils, parents or governors.</p>

<h2>Types of review</h2>

<h3>Marking review query</h3>

<p>Schools can apply for a marking review for as many pupils as they require, if they consider there is a discrepancy between how the questions have been marked and the published mark scheme. We recommend that schools only submit a review application if it meets the criteria for a successful review.</p>

<p>Schools should be aware that a pupil’s raw score and scaled score could go up or down as a result of a review.</p>

<p>Marking reviews can only be completed where a pupil has a result for every test paper for that subject.</p>

<h3>Clerical review query</h3>

<p>Schools can apply for a clerical review if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a test marked on paper has an error, such as an incorrect addition of the marks awarded</li>
  <li>a test script has been matched to the wrong pupil</li>
  <li>there is an error on the school attendance register – for example, an attendance code needs to be corrected</li>
</ul>

<p>Only acceptable changes to attendance registers can be made. For example, if a pupil has taken a test and their script has been sent for marking, their school cannot request that the attendance register is changed to indicate that the pupil was working below the standard of the test (marked as B).</p>

<p>Schools should be aware that a pupil’s raw score and scaled score could go up or down as a result of a review.</p>

<h3>Charges</h3>

<p>The table below sets out when we would charge for a review and how much it costs per pupil, per subject.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Type of review</th>
      <th scope="col">When charges would apply</th>
      <th scope="col" style="text-align: right">Cost per pupil, per subject</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Marking review</td>
      <td>The review does not result in a change to the pupil achieving the expected standard, the pupil not meeting the expected standard, or a total raw score change by fewer than 2 marks.</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">£9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Clerical review</td>
      <td>The review does not correct a test script matched to the wrong pupil, or produces no change to the raw score or scaled score, or the assigned code for why the pupil has not taken the test.</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">£5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Where charges are applicable, our supplier, Capita, will invoice your school through the ‘Outstanding activity’ section of the Primary Assessment Gateway once the review process is complete. Your school’s account manager will receive an email notification when your review invoice is available.</p>

<h2>Applying for a review</h2>

<p>Schools should read this guidance in full before requesting a marking or clerical review on the Primary Assessment Gateway.</p>

<p>Schools can request a review using the ‘View and download KS2 test results’ form and selecting the test subject. Reviews must be submitted for each pupil, for each subject, individually using the ‘Request’ button in the review column next to the relevant pupil’s outcome.</p>

<p>On the application form, schools must select whether the request is for a clerical or marking review.</p>

<p>For a clerical review, schools must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select a reason from the drop-down list</li>
  <li>provide more information about the reason for the request</li>
  <li>provide up to two alternate contacts for any application queries during the summer holidays</li>
  <li>select ‘Submit’</li>
</ul>

<p>For a marking review, schools must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide more information, this must include the reason for the review for each paper / question. Please use the following format to enable the review marker to understand and respond to your concerns. ‘Paper (insert which paper if applicable) / Question (insert question number) – (insert comment)’</li>
  <li>provide up to two alternate contacts for any application queries during the summer holidays</li>
  <li>select ‘Submit’</li>
</ul>

<p>The Primary Assessment Gateway generates an automated email confirming that the review has been submitted and can be amended up to the deadline of 11:59pm on Friday 15 July.</p>

<p>Providing contact details is essential should our supplier need to resolve any queries with your school. If they cannot make contact to resolve queries during the review marking period (over the school summer holidays), applications may be rejected.</p>

<h2>The review process</h2>

<p>During a marking review, we check all test papers for the pupil, for that subject, to make sure that the original application of the mark scheme was accurate and no clerical errors were made. For example, for mathematics, we review mark Paper 1: arithmetic, Paper 2: reasoning and Paper 3: reasoning.</p>

<p>A panel of experienced supervisory markers, who have achieved the highest quality marking standards throughout the marking period, complete review marking. Review markers are supervised and their work is sampled to ensure that the mark scheme for the subject they are reviewing is applied correctly and marking quality is maintained. If review markers do not apply the mark scheme as required, or do not adhere to the review procedures, they will be stopped from review marking. In this situation, any review marking they have carried out will be reviewed again by another review marker.</p>

<p>Marks may be awarded or deducted following the review of a pupil’s test papers. As a result, a review can lead to an increase or decrease of the raw score, which may affect the scaled score and the achievement of the expected standard.</p>

<h3>Tests marked on screen</h3>

<p>Test scripts marked on screen will be reviewed on screen. However, if there are any difficulties review marking a script onscreen, it will be review marked on paper.</p>

<h3>Tests marked on paper</h3>

<p>We mark the following tests on paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all braille, braille transcriptions, enlarged print and modified large print versions of the tests</li>
  <li>test scripts that could not be scanned for on-screen marking – for example, due to the condition of the test scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>You must indicate whether you are applying for a marking review or clerical review. A marking review for tests marked on paper also includes a clerical review of the addition of marks.</p>

<p>If you apply for a review for any test scripts which were marked on paper these must be returned to Capita to enable a review. Schools can arrange a marking review script collection by contacting the national curriculum assessments helpline on 0300 303 3013.</p>

<p>Schools must ensure the original marked test scripts are ready for collection as agreed with Capita. We will not accept copies. If schools do not have scripts ready for the agreed collection, it will be the school’s responsibility to return scripts to Capita by an agreed date at their own cost. Schools would need to contact the helpline to confirm the return address and deadline. If Capita does not have the scripts marked on paper, they will be unable to complete the review and the review will be rejected.</p>

<p>We will only consider review applications if a pupil’s test script has not been amended or annotated in any way following the original marking (including circling the evidence for review or adding sticky notes to the test script). This is so the review marker can reach an impartial judgement. Schools can provide comments using the ‘more information’ box within the review application form.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to reject review applications, without giving any further reason, if a school has made amendments of any kind to a pupil’s test script.</p>

<h2>Review outcomes</h2>

<p>Review outcomes will be available on Primary Assessment Gateway on Wednesday 7 September 2022.
Depending on the outcome of the review, we will amend pupil results in the ‘View and download KS2 test results’ form on the Primary Assessment Gateway.</p>

<p>For each subject you will have available, a letter confirming the outcome of your review application, a notification of changes sheet and a marking review report for each per pupil. Each of these contains important information about your review. The marking review report is completed by the review marker who review marked your school’s test scripts for a given subject.</p>

<p>You will be able to access reviewed test scripts using the ‘View and download KS2 test results’ form in the ‘Available activity’ section of the Primary Assessment Gateway. This will show the review marks for each pupil.</p>

<p>If you send test scripts marked on paper for review, we will return them to your school by Tuesday 6 September 2022.</p>
