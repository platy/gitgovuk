<h2>When you can make a delayed supplementary declaration</h2>

<p>You can only make a delayed supplementary import declaration using the Customs Declaration Service if your goods are not controlled, are moving from EU free circulation and HMRC has not told you that you cannot make an import declaration in your records without authorisation, and either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you brought goods from EU free circulation into free circulation in Great Britain, between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021</li>
  <li>you bring goods from free circulation in Ireland (including goods that started their movement in Northern Ireland) into free circulation in Great Britain, from 1 January 2022</li>
  <li>you bring goods that <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-to-declare-goods-you-bring-into-or-take-out-of-the-UK/start?_ga=2.12322355.64415001.1639733804-693254290.1612880359">need to be declared</a> from Northern Ireland (including goods that started their movement in Ireland) into free circulation in Great Britain, from 1 January 2022</li>

<h3>Data Element 1/1 – Declaration type</h3>

<p>Enter ‘IM’.</p>

<h3>Data Element 1/2 – Additional declaration type</h3>

<p>You (or someone dealing with customs for you) must be authorised for either entry in the declarant’s records or the simplified declaration procedure before you can submit a delayed supplementary declaration.</p>

<p>Enter the code for the authorisation you hold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>code ‘Y’ for a simplified declaration procedure</li>
  <li>code ‘Z’ for entry in a declarant’s record</li>
</ul>

<p>You will only be able to use the code you are authorised to use. You will find this information in your authorisation letter sent to you by HMRC.</p>

<p>If you are not authorised you must get this authorisation from HMRC (or get someone to deal with customs for you) before submitting your delayed supplementary declaration.</p>

<h3>Data Element 1/6 – Goods item number</h3>

<p>This identifies the specific item you’re currently filling out the information for. For example, item number 5 of 12 items.</p>

<h3>Data Element 1/8 – Signature or authentication</h3>

<p>Leave blank. Your system ID will replace the requirement for a signature.</p>

<h3>Data Element 1/9 – Total number of items</h3>

<p>You’ll need to enter the total number of goods items you’re declaring on this declaration.</p>

<p>You will find this information in your commercial records.</p>

<h3>Data Element 1/10 – Procedure</h3>

<p>You are only allowed to use delayed declarations to release goods into free circulation. The procedure code identifies the customs regime which goods are being entered into and if they were previously in a different procedure.</p>

<p>The procedure is a 4-digit code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the first 2 digits say which procedure you’ve released the goods into (for example, free circulation)</li>
  <li>the third and fourth digits is the procedure the goods were in previously   (for example, if the goods were in a customs warehouse)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are importing goods into free circulation under delayed declarations, the first 2 digits will be either ‘40’ or ‘61’.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list" class="govuk-link">Find the procedure code you need to use</a>.</p>

<h3>Data Element 1/11 – Additional procedure</h3>

<p>This is a 3-digit code which relates to a specific set of circumstances which applies to your goods. For example, for samples you would use one code to claim the duty relief and another code to claim the VAT relief.</p>

<p>You will need to look up your 4-digit procedure code on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/4-digit-to-3-digit-procedure-to-additional-procedure-code-correlation-matrix-for-cds" class="govuk-link">correlation matrix</a> to see which 3-digit codes are allowed to be used with it.</p>

<p>If you do not choose a permitted code, the system will reject it.</p>

<p>You should look up each of the permitted 3-digit codes in the index list to see which codes apply to you or your goods. Depending on the circumstances that apply, more than one Additional Procedure Code may be required so you will need to check every permitted code to ensure you identify all the necessary codes for your goods.</p>

<h3>Data Element 2/1 – Simplified declarations or previous documents</h3>

<p>On delayed declarations you must enter YDCR, then the Declaration Unique Consignment Reference quoted in the entry in declarant’s records. You must then enter YCLE, then the date the goods were entered to entry in declarant’s records.</p>

<p>Other entries may be required on the declaration depending on the procedure code declared in DE 1/10. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Check the procedure code notes in Appendix 1</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Data Element 2/2 – Additional information</h3>

<p>The codes provided in this Data Element are used to provide any extra information that is needed to process the customs declaration.</p>

<p>The information is declared using a specific code, then the required additional information.</p>

<p>The codes used help customs identify what information is being provided and why.</p>

<p>The types of additional information needed in this Data Element may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relationships between different parties (people) involved in the declaration</li>
  <li>restrictions that may apply to the goods</li>
  <li>specific processes intended to be carried out on the goods whilst under customs control</li>
  <li>names and addresses of other parties or premises involved</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the code ‘00500’ indicates where a trader is submitting a declaration themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/additional-information-ai-statement-codes-for-data-element-22-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds" class="govuk-link">Find the procedure code you need to use</a>.</p>

<h3>Data Element 2/3 – Documents produced, certificates and authorisations, and additional references</h3>

<p>A document code, with a reference number or other details to be declared is used to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>authorisation decision numbers such as simplified declaration procedure, entry in declarant’s records, Deferment, customs comprehensive guarantee</li>
  <li>licence reference numbers and quantities where required</li>
  <li>preference certificates and quantities where required</li>
  <li>veterinary or health certificates and quantities where required</li>
  <li>invoices</li>
  <li>other commercial documents, such as packing lists</li>
</ul>

<p>When using delayed declarations, the declarant must enter their simplified customs declaration procedure authorisation into this Data Element using document code ‘C514’.</p>

<p>If there is Customs Duty to pay, enter document codes ‘C505’ and ‘C506’.</p>

<p>You must also declare any document codes needed by measures against the commodity code of the goods. For example, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) goods. This will be shown in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/sections" class="govuk-link">UK Global Online Tariff</a>.</p>

<p>If you are claiming preference, you will need to enter a document code to support your claim. Use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/customs-declaration-completion-requirements-for-great-britain" class="govuk-link">Customs Declaration Completion Requirements for Great Britain</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Data Element 2/4 – Reference number or Unique Consignment Reference</h3>

<p>You may choose to use a commercial reference number for your own purposes in this field or leave this blank.</p>

<h3>Data Element 2/5 – Local Reference Number</h3>

<p>Enter a unique reference number which identifies the submission to the Customs Declaration Service. For example, if you submit a declaration and change it in future, those changes should have different reference numbers so different versions can be easily identified.</p>

<h3>Data Element 2/6 – Deferred payment</h3>

<p>You must settle any Customs Duty and import VAT (if you are not VAT registered) using your (or your customs agent’s) Duty Deferment Account number. Enter the relevant deferment approval number in this Data Element.</p>

<p>If you are authorised for simplified customs procedures, as part of your authorisation, you will have a Duty Deferment Account.</p>

<h3>Data Element 2/7 – Identification of warehouse</h3>

<p>If your goods were stored in a customs warehouse before they were in free circulation, you should enter the warehouse number where your goods were stored.</p>

<p>Your public warehouse keeper should have this information or if it a private warehouse, you should have received an authorisation with this code.</p>

<h3>Data Element 3/1 – Exporter</h3>

<p>Enter the details of the persons who sold you the goods outside Great Britain. You’ll need to provide their name and address.</p>

<p>You will find this information in your commercial records.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Data Element 4/15 – Exchange rate</h3>

<p>Only complete this Data Element if you have a fixed rate of exchange with your seller. For example, if you’re buying goods with a fixed conversion rate over a fixed period, you would specify this here. Leave it blank if you do not have a fixed exchange rate with your seller.</p>

<h3>Data Element 4/16 – Valuation method</h3>

<p>The means by which your goods are valued. There are 6 valuation methods, for example for sale price you would use method 1.</p>

<h3>Data Element 4/17 – Preference</h3>

<p>Completion of this box is mandatory. If you are not claiming preference, use a code beginning with ‘1’.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to pay a reduced about of duty if your goods if they’re covered by the free trade agreement with the EU</p>

<p>Use this data element if you’ve declared an air freight adjustment in Data Element 4/9. This relates to the airport the goods left from. Enter the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/place-of-loading-codes-for-data-element-521-of-the-customs-declaration-service" class="govuk-link">3-digit code relevant to the airport</a>.</p>

<h3>Data Element 5/23 – Location of goods</h3>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/goods-location-codes-for-data-element-523-of-the-customs-declaration-service" class="govuk-link">the code where the goods were  located</a> at the point of release to the procedure. For example, the port of airport the goods came into Great Britain.</p>

<h3>Data Element 5/26 – Customs office of presentation</h3>

<p>Leave this field blank.</p>

<h3>Data Element 5/27 – Supervising customs office</h3>

<h3>Data Element 6/1 – Net mass (kg)</h3>

<p>The weight of the goods (in kg), excluding external packaging, rounded to 6 decimal places where needed.</p>

<h3>Data Element 6/2 – Supplementary units</h3>

<p>The Customs Duty section on the commodity code   will tell you if you need to complete this data element or not.</p>

<p>If you do, enter which unit applies to the goods. For example, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>litres</li>
  <li>number of individual pieces</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Element 6/5 – Gross mass (kg)</h3>

<p>The weight of the goods (in kg), including external packaging, rounded to 6 decimal places where needed.</p>

<h3>Data Element 6/8 – Description of goods</h3>

<p>Enter a plain language description of the goods that is enough to allow for easy identification of what the goods are. You cannot use general trade terms (for example ‘parts’) or the description of the goods as they appear in the trade tariff tool.</p>

<p>For example, ‘magnesium potassium sulphate’. Do not use generic terms such as ‘minerals or chemical goods’.</p>

<h3>Data Element 6/9 – Type of packages</h3>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/package-type-codes-for-data-element-69-of-the-customs-declaration-service" class="govuk-link">the code for how your goods were  packaged</a>. For example, were  they in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>boxes</li>
  <li>bags</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Element 6/11 – Shipping marks</h3>

<p>Enter the mark that appeared  on the packages. For example, if the package had a reference number on the outside, specify the reference number. If you’ve declared more than one package, you should specify the same number of shipping marks.</p>

<h3>Data Element 6/13 – CUS code</h3>

<p>The provision of the CUS code is optional where no Tariff measure exists for the goods concerned.</p>

<p>This Data Element only needs to be completed where you import certain chemical substances. Chemicals classified in chapters 28 and 29 of the UK Trade Tariff should be described using their precise chemical name and the appropriate 8-digit CUS code. If you are not importing chemical substances, leave this Data Element blank.</p>

<p>The CUS number is the identification number assigned to chemical products in the European Customs Inventory of Chemical Substances (ECICS) database. 
Where the chemical is not listed, the precise name in accordance with British Standard 2474/1983 and the words ‘not listed’ must be declared in DE 6/8 Description of Goods.</p>

<p>Enter the first 8 digits of the commodity code for the goods described in Data Element 6/8 as set out in the UK Trade Tariff.

<h3>Data Element 6/15 – Commodity code – TARIC code</h3>

<p>Enter the 9th and 10th digit of the commodity code. This will tell customs if any duty is owed.</p>

<h3>Data Element 6/16 – Commodity code – TARIC additional codes</h3>

<p>Enter the 11th to 14th digits of the commodity code. You will need to look up the applicable TARIC additional code. There are two ways of identifying codes. Where no TARIC additional code applies this box may be left blank.</p>

<h4>Meursing codes</h4>

<p>These are TARIC additional codes that specify if additional restrictions or measures apply to the goods, such as milk products (meursing codes) or prohibitions or restrictions on import.</p>

<p>Meursing codes are needed for the import or export of goods containing certain types of milk and sugars covered Regulation (EC) No. 118/2010.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/additional-commodity-code" class="govuk-link">look up meursing codes using the online tool</a>.</p>

<h4>Other TARIC additional codes</h4>

<p>Other TARIC additional codes are needed where a prohibition or restriction, Anti-dumping measure or specific Tariff Preference measure applies to the goods. Tariff Preference does not always need an additional code to be declared in Box 33(3).</p>

<p>These TARIC additional codes are shown as Tariff measures in the UK Trade Tariff.</p>

<p>They can also be found using the <a href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/additional_code_search" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UK Global Online Tariff</a>.</p>

<h3>Data Element 6/17 – Commodity code – national additional codes</h3>

<p>Enter the 15th or 18th digits of the commodity code. This is used to specify the rate of national taxes. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>zero-rated VAT</li>
  <li>rate of excise duty</li>
</ul>

<p>If the commodity code for your goods is entirely zero-rated for import VAT, you must still enter the code ‘VATZ’ to get the zero-rating.</p>

<p>You will get this from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff">the trade tariff tool</a>. Appendix 19 of the Customs Declarations Service Tariff provides an index list for these codes.</p>

<h3>Data Element 6/18 – Total packages</h3>

<p>Enter the total number of packages across all items.</p>

<h3>Data Element 7/2 – Container</h3>

  <li>‘1’ if the goods were  in a container</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Element 7/4 – Mode of transport at the border</h3>

<p>Enter the mode of transport used at the border to import your goods. Enter code ‘6’ where a Roll-On Roll-Off (<abbr title="Roll-On Roll-Off">RoRo</abbr>) vehicle is used at a <abbr title="Roll-On Roll-Off">RoRo</abbr> listed location.</p>

<h3>Data Element 7/5 – Inland mode of transport</h3>

<h3>Data Element 7/9 – Identity of means of transport on arrival</h3>

<p>Enter the registration number or name of the means of transport. For example:</p>

<ul>

<h3>Data Element 8/2 – Guarantee type</h3>

<p>If you are using your Duty Deferment Account to settle any Customs Duty owing, you must complete this Data Element. If you need to evidence a guarantee on the declaration, enter code ‘1’.</p>

<h3>Data Element 8/3 – Guarantee reference number</h3>

<p>If you entered code ‘1’ in Data Element 8/3 and do require a guarantee, enter the reference number of the guarantee.   This will be provided to you by your bank or other institution that provided you with the guarantee.</p>

<p>If you entered code ‘0’ in Data Element 8/2 and do not need a guarantee, enter ‘guaranteenotrequired’ if you do not require a guarantee.</p>

<h3>Data Element 8/5 – Nature of transaction</h3>
