<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance is designed to assist people planning to get married or form a civil partnership in England, and venues that host ceremonies and receptions, to enable them to conduct them in a manner that reduces the risk of transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to all weddings and civil partnership ceremonies and formations taking place in England as well as wedding and civil partnership receptions and celebrations.</p>

<p>Alternative wedding ceremonies that are not binding under the law, whether religious, belief based, blessings, or other forms of non-statutory ceremony, are also covered by this guidance.</p>

<p>Those wishing to conduct a religious ceremony should refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-during-the-pandemic-from-4-july" class="govuk-link">places of worship guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Keeping yourself and others safe</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s important that we all use personal judgement to manage our own risk. All of us can play our part by exercising common sense and considering the risks. There are steps everyone can take to reduce the risk of transmission:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19, even if theyâ€™re mild, should not attend. This includes the couple, attendees, and anyone working or involved in the ceremony or reception. They should self-isolate immediately and <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link">get a PCR test</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone has been instructed by NHS Test and Trace to self-isolate they must self-isolate and not attend. Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#main-messages">guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People should wear a face covering in enclosed and crowded spaces. People are encouraged to respect other attendees and those working at events who may wish to adopt a more cautious approach. Please refer to the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread#keeping-yourself-and-others-safe" class="govuk-link">how to stay safe and stop the spread of COVID-19</a> for further information and the actions to take to reduce the chance of spreading COVID-19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NHS COVID-19 app is a vital part of NHS Test and Trace in England and Wales. Using the app helps stop the spread of the virus by informing you that you have been in close contact with someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus, even if you donâ€™t know each other.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>A face covering is something which safely covers your mouth and nose. Face coverings work best if they are made with multiple layers (at least 2 and preferably 3) and form a good fit around the nose and mouth.</p>

<p>Face coverings are no longer required by law. However, the government suggests that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed settings where they come into contact with people they do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Where worn correctly, this may reduce the risk of transmission to themselves and others. Be aware that workers may choose to wear a face covering in the workplace.</p>

<p>Businesses can choose to encourage visitors or workers to wear a face covering. Consider encouraging the use of face coverings by visitors and workers in enclosed and crowded spaces where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet.</p>

<p>When deciding your approach to face coverings, you need to consider the reasonable adjustments for staff and visitors with disabilities. You also need to consider carefully how this fits with other obligations to visitors and workers arising from the law on employment rights, health and safety and equality legislation.</p>

<p>Some people are not able to wear face coverings, and the reasons for this may not be visible to others. Please be mindful and respectful of such circumstances.</p>

<p>Be aware that face coverings may make it harder to communicate with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">Find out more about face coverings.</a></p>

<h2>Let fresh air in</h2>

<p>When events take place inside or in other enclosed spaces, consider how the space can be continually well ventilated, before, during and after the event.</p>

<p>Letting fresh air into indoor spaces is important because when a person infected with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> coughs, talks or breathes, they release droplets and aerosols which can be inhaled by other people. The more fresh air there is to breathe, the less likely other people are to inhale infectious particles. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus/ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19">Read the guidance on ventilation of indoor spaces to stop the spread of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Around 1 in 3 people with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> do not have any symptoms but can still infect others. Testing increases the chances of detecting <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> when a person is infectious, helping to make sure people donâ€™t spread <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>You may wish to take a rapid lateral flow test if you expect there will be a period of high risk that day or before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illness if they were infected with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. Tests are available from pharmacies or online. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests" class="govuk-link">Find out more about how to get rapid lateral flow tests</a>.</p>

<h2>Using the NHS Covid Pass</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID Pass allows people to demonstrate that theyâ€™re at a lower risk of carrying <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> and transmitting it to others, through vaccination, testing or natural immunity. It can help organisations to reduce the risk of transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s no longer mandatory for high-risk events and venues to check the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> status of attendees. However, weddings with large numbers of attendees may choose to continue to check the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> status of attendees and the workforce to keep everyone safer.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/covid-19-response/using-the-nhs-covid-pass/" rel="external">Find out more about how to use the NHS COVID Pass.</a></p>

<h2>Returning to the workplace</h2>

<p>The government is no longer asking people to work from home if they can.</p>

<p>You should now talk to your workers to agree arrangements to return to the office, consulting with workers and trade unions where appropriate. You should remain responsive to workersâ€™ needs and consult with them on any health and safety measures you have put in place to reduce the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> spreading. You should give extra consideration to people at higher risk of severe illness from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, and to workers facing mental and physical health difficulties.</p>

<p>When considering working arrangements, employers should take into account their other existing legal obligations.</p>

<p>When considering workers return to their place of work, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reflect this in your risk assessment</li>
  <li>take action to manage the risks of transmission in line with this guidance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-isolation</h2>

<p>If you develop <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms, you must self-isolate immediately and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/">get a PCR test</a>.</p>

<p>If you have been identified as a contact of someone with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, and youâ€™re not legally required to self-isolate, youâ€™re now strongly advised to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a rapid lateral flow test every day for 7 days, or until 10 days after your last contact with the person who tested positive for <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> if this is earlier</li>
  <li>take this daily rapid lateral flow test before you leave your home for the first time that day</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these tests are positive, you should immediately self-isolate.</p>

<p>People who have received a positive rapid lateral flow test result but do not have any of the main symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, should report the result and self-isolate. You do not need to take a follow-up PCR test unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you want to claim the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/test-and-trace-support-payment" class="govuk-link">Test and Trace Support Payment</a>
</li>
  <li>you have a health condition that means you may be suitable for new <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> treatments</li>
  <li>youâ€™re taking lateral flow tests as part of research or surveillance programmes, and the programme asks you to do so</li>
  <li>youâ€™re an international arrival and have a positive day 2 lateral flow test</li>
</ul>

<p>You must self-isolate from the day your symptoms started or from the day you receive a positive test result if you do not have symptoms.</p>

<p>You may be able to end your self-isolation period before the end of the 10 full days. You can end your self isolation on the sixth day of self-isolation following 5 full days isolating and 2 negative rapid lateral flow tests taken on consecutive days. The first rapid lateral flow test should not be taken before the fifth day. The self-isolation period remains 10 full days for those without negative results from 2 lateral flow tests taken a day apart. This is the law, regardless of whether you have been vaccinated.</p>

<p>Self-isolating is important because you could pass the infection on to others, even if you do not have symptoms. You must self-isolate for the full amount of time you are told to, because this is the period when the virus is most likely to be passed on to others.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Under 5s are exempt from self-isolation and do not need to take part in daily rapid lateral flow testing.</p>
</div>

<h2>Protecting the vulnerable</h2>

<p>People at higher risk are advised to follow the guidance on how to stay safe and prevent the spread of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>They should take advice from their health professional on whether additional precautions are right for them.</p>

<h2>Handling objects and communal resources</h2>

<p>Surfaces can become contaminated with viruses like <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. Once contaminated, touching them can transfer viruses to peopleâ€™s eyes, nose or mouth. From there, viruses can enter someoneâ€™s body and infect them. This means that, touching or kissing objects that are handled communally including consumables, carries a risk of catching or spreading a virus.</p>

<p>The use of shared communal objects, including consumables, is now a personal choice. However, youâ€™re advised to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">advice on personal hygiene</a>.</p>

<h2>Singing, music, and performances</h2>

<p>There are no limits on the number of people who can sing or perform indoors or outdoors. However, some activities can also increase the risk of catching or passing on <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. This happens where people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe heavily, such as singing, dancing, exercising or raising their voices.</p>

<p>The risk is greatest where these activities take place when people are in close contact with others, for example in crowded indoor spaces where people are raising their voices.</p>

<p>In situations where there is a higher risk of catching or passing on <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, you should be particularly careful to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">guidance on keeping yourself and others safe</a>.</p>

<p>Where a venue or part of a venue is being used for an event where the main activities include eating, drinking and dancing, face coverings are not required.</p>

<h2>Businesses and venues</h2>

<p>All businesses should follow the principles set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">working safely guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Employers still have a legal duty to manage risks to those affected by their business. The way to do this is to carry out a health and safety risk assessment, including the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, and to take reasonable steps to mitigate the risks identified. Working Safely guidance sets out a range of mitigations employers should consider including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaning surfaces that people touch regularly</li>
  <li>identifying poorly-ventilated areas in the venue and taking steps to improve air flow</li>
  <li>ensuring that staff and customers who are unwell do not attend the workplace or venue</li>
  <li>communicating to staff and customers the measures you have put in place</li>
</ul>

<h2>Food and drink</h2>

<p>Where food and drinks are consumed, staff and attendees should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/restaurants-pubs-bars-nightclubs-and-takeaway-services" class="govuk-link">guidance for restaurants, pubs, bars, nightclubs and takeaway services</a>.</p>

<h2>Using the NHS <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> app</h2>

<p>Using the NHS <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> app helps stop the spread of the virus by informing people that they have been in close contact with someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus, even if they donâ€™t know each other. The app is free and easy to use.</p>

<p>The app also allows people to report symptoms, order a coronavirus test and check in to venues using a QR code. To help protect yourself and others, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.covid19.nhs.uk/">download and use the latest version of the NHS <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> app</a>.</p>

<h2>Collection of contact details</h2>

<p>Businesses are no longer required by law to collect customer contact details, or keep a record of staff and visitors.</p>

<p>However, businesses are encouraged to continue to display an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">NHS QR code</a> for customers wishing to check in using the app, as this will help to reduce the spread of the virus and protect customers, visitors and staff. Businesses do not have to ask customers to check in, or turn them away if they refuse.</p>

<p>If businesses display an NHS QR code, they should also have a system to collect (and securely store) names and contact details for those who ask to check-in but do not have access to a smartphone or prefer not to use the app.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>If somebody from abroad is travelling to England to attend a marriage or a civil partnership ceremony or reception, they should check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">advice on travelling to England</a>.</p>
