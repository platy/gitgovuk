<p>This page tells you what to do if thereâ€™s a no-deal Brexit. It will be updated if anything changes, including if a deal is agreed.</p>

<p>After the UK leaves the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> it will no longer be part of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> competition system.</p>

<p>The European Commission will no longer begin investigations into the UK elements of mergers or cases involving anti-competitive conduct in the UK.</p>

<p>Instead, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority">Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>)</a> will be responsible for investigating mergers and cases of anti-competitive conduct which affect the UK market.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> will also take jurisdiction of the UK aspects of live <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> antitrust and merger cases that the European Commission was investigating before Brexit, but which have not yet been decided. Businesses should be aware that it is possible that there will be no agreement on jurisdiction over these cases.</p>

<p>Businesses operating in the UK must continue to comply with UK competition law as they do now and those operating in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> must comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> competition law.</p>

<h2 id="actions-for-businesses-and-other-stakeholders">Actions for businesses and other stakeholders</h2>

<p>Most businesses will not need to take any action unless you are subject to an ongoing investigation or considering a merger transaction.</p>

<h3 id="mergers">Mergers</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> merger system will continue to apply to the UK until the point of Brexit. Businesses considering a merger which will have an impact in both the UK and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> single market will need to comply with both <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and UK merger rules.</p>

<p>Businesses should contact both the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and the European Commission where they meet the relevant thresholds.</p>

<p>For live <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> merger cases with UK aspects, where businesses do not expect to receive an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decision before exit, they should contact the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and the European Commission to find out if they need to make parallel notifications.</p>

<h3 id="antitrust">Antitrust</h3>

<p>Businesses subject to an ongoing antitrust investigation at the point of exit should take independent legal advice on how to comply with any ongoing investigation by the European Commission and/or the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Businesses operating in the UK and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> will need to comply with the UK and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> antitrust rules. Breaches of these rules may be investigated by both the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and the European Commission in parallel where there are effects in both markets.</p>

<h3 id="block-exemptions">Block exemptions</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> block exemption regulations that currently exempt certain types of agreements from competition rules where there are benefits for consumers will be preserved in the UK.</p>

<p>Businesses will want to satisfy themselves that they continue to fall within the terms of the preserved exemptions, but the intention is that agreements that benefit from these exemptions should continue to do so.</p>

<h3 id="damages">Damages</h3>

<p>Businesses or consumers who wish to claim damages based on competition infringement decisions will not be able to rely on decisions made by the European Commission after Brexit day in the UK courts. They should take independent legal advice about pursuing any claim.</p>
