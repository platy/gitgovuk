<p>This guide is for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British citizens</a> travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<h2>Entry requirements</h2>

<p>If you’re going to Sweden to work (or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU country</a>, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein#passports-check-if-you-need-to-renew">make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some work-related things without needing a visa or work permit, such as attend business meetings.</p>

<p>These are usually covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">Schengen visa waiver</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going for other types of work you may need a visa, work permit or residence permit.</p>

<p>The Swedish authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You must always check with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Startpage.html" rel="external">Sweden’s government</a>  before you travel, to make sure you meet their legal requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re working in more than one country you will need to check the entry rules of each country.</p>

<p>If you need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe">passport</a>, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.</p>

<h3>Visa and permit documents</h3>
<p>This guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Sweden. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.</p>

<p>It may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with the Swedish authorities or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<p>You must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>translated</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised">‘legalised’ (apostillised)</a> or notarised</li>
  <li>originals, or if copies are acceptable</li>
  <li>signed in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)</li>
  <li>dated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Countries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa.</p>

<p>This guide uses the same terms used in Sweden, so you know which ones to use when speaking to the Swedish authorities.</p>

<h2>Check if you need a visa or permit</h2>

<p>You don’t need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Sweden for up to 90 days within 180 days for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running or attending job interviews</li>
  <li>going to court as a witness</li>
  <li>attending trade fairs</li>
  <li>meeting clients or customers (including entertainment like eating at a restaurant)</li>
  <li>meeting colleagues, contractors or sellers</li>
  <li>fact-finding visits</li>
  <li>negotiating, signing and executing deals or contracts in certain situations</li>
  <li>attending, speaking or presenting at a conference if you’re not being paid</li>
  <li>team building activities</li>
  <li>leisure travel, such as holidays or visiting friends or family</li>
</ul>

<p>Or for the following types of training, so long as it’s for the same company or group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receiving classroom-based training</li>
  <li>receiving on-the-job training</li>
  <li>shadowing someone’s job</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are covered by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-a-visa-or-permit-for-europe">visa waiver</a>.</p>

<h3>Border checks</h3>

<p>At the border, you may be asked to show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets</li>
  <li>health insurance that covers your stay</li>
  <li>proof of accommodation for your entire stay</li>
  <li>enough money for the duration of your trip</li>
  <li>an invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip, or a plan for any training with a description of the purpose of your visit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Sweden’s exemptions</h2>

<p>Certain types of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Other-operators/Employers/Special-rules-for-certain-occupations-and-citizens-of-certain-countries/Exemptions-to-the-work-permit-requirement.html" rel="external">work-related activities do not require a visa or permit</a> because they’re exempt.</p>

<p>All countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.</p>

<p>These do not require a visa or permit in Sweden:</p>

<ul>
  <li>emergency repairs or installation activities, including technical fitters and instructors – for up to 2 months</li>
  <li>participating in training, testing, preparation or completion of deliveries, or similar activities as a business transaction – for up to 3 months in a 12-month period</li>
  <li>specialists working temporarily for an international corporation for less than 90 days</li>
  <li>consular officials or diplomats and their families and staff – this generally applies to the current mission only</li>
  <li>temporary TV or radio workers for Nordisk Television AB (TV4-gruppen/TV4 AB), Sveriges Utbildningsradio AB, Sveriges Radio AB or Sveriges Television AB – for up to 1 month</li>
  <li>performers for film, audio-visual content and shows and their technical production team – so long as the performer has been invited by an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Other-operators-English/Employers/Special-rules-for-certain-occupations-and-citizens-of-certain-countries/Performers/Established-arrangers.html" rel="external">established arranger from the Swedish Migration Agency</a> – for up to 14 business days over 12 months</li>
  <li>professional athletes and functionaries taking part in international competitions – for up to 3 months over 12 months</li>
  <li>railway personnel and international commercial traffic lorry drivers employed outside of Sweden</li>
  <li>temporary employees working for a company that doesn’t have a branch or office in Sweden, such as journalists or salespeople</li>
  <li>caregivers working for an employer who is visiting Sweden for medical treatment – for up to 3 months</li>
  <li>professors and researchers invited to teach, research or hold lectures at higher education institutions – for up to 3 months in a 12-month period</li>
  <li>claimants (plaintiffs) or witnesses in a criminal investigation who obtained a residence permit as a result of that</li>
  <li>volunteers giving aid support for a disaster or accident in Sweden – for the period of deployment</li>
  <li>drivers and travel guides who accompany tourist groups to Sweden – for up to 3 months</li>
  <li>those with a residence permit for higher education studies in Sweden</li>
  <li>those with an EU-intra company transfer permit (EU ICT) from another country – for 90 days in a 180-day period</li>
  <li>sole traders working for Swedish clients on contracts – for a maximum of 90 days or the amount of available Schengen days they have (conditions apply so check with the authorities)</li>
</ul>

<p>Employers need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.av.se/en/work-environment-work-and-inspections/foreign-labour-in-sweden/Posting-foreign-labour-in-sweden/employers-obligations/" rel="external">submit a notification</a> to the Swedish work environment authority (SWEA) for all workers sent (posted) to Sweden to work.</p>

<h3>Show proof of exemption</h3>

<p>You need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an assignment or invitation letter</li>
  <li>employment confirmation</li>
  <li>a contract</li>
  <li>proof of required qualifications, such as a diploma or professional certificate</li>
  <li>CV</li>
</ul>

<h3>Further checks</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">Swedish embassy</a>.</p>

<h2>Applying for a visa or permit</h2>

<p>This guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit type, but you need to check the exact rules and processes with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden.html" rel="external">Swedish Migration Agency</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy</a>.</p>

<h3>Taking your family</h3>

<p>If you have a family they may be able to join you on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Permits-for-family-members.html" rel="external">dependant visas</a>. It depends what type of permit you have.</p>

<h3>Work and residence permits</h3>

<p>Sweden offers the same permits for short or long stays. If you’re working in Sweden for 3 months or less, you will only need a work permit. If you’re working in Sweden for more than 3 months you will need a work and residence permit.</p>

<p>You must apply for a permit if you’re in Sweden because you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer">transferring to the Swedish branch of a UK-based company</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#employment">working for a Swedish company on a Swedish employment contract</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#services">providing services to a client in Sweden</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#self-employed">carrying out self-employed work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#researcher">conducting research work</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They are valid for up to 3 years depending on which one you need.</p>

<h2>Transferring to a Swedish branch of a UK-based company</h2>
<p>You need one of the following permits if your UK-based company moves you to a Swedish branch to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#ICT">EU intra-company transfer permit</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#residence">Work and residence permit (assignment)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>EU intra-company transfer</h3>
<p>You need a long-term <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Employed/Special-rules-for-certain-occupations-and-citizens-of-certain-countries/ICT-permit.html" rel="external">intra-company transfer permit (ICT)</a> if your UK-based company moves you to a branch in Sweden to work for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 3 years if you’re a manager or specialist</li>
  <li>1 year if you’re a trainee</li>
</ul>

<p>To qualify you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have worked for the company abroad for at least 3 consecutive months</li>
  <li>be a manager, specialist or trainee</li>
  <li>be of great importance to the business if you’re a manager or specialist – having a manager or specialist title is not enough</li>
  <li>have a bachelor’s level degree as a trainee, or relevant work experience as a specialist or manager</li>
  <li>have specialist knowledge in the field</li>
  <li>have the required qualifications recognised in Sweden for regulated professions</li>
  <li>be paid a salary that is at least at the same level as in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.av.se/en/work-environment-work-and-inspections/foreign-labour-in-sweden/Posting-foreign-labour-in-sweden/swedish-labour-market-model-and-collective-agreements/" rel="external">Swedish collective agreements</a>, or equivalent to similar positions in Sweden</li>
  <li>have employment terms that are at least on the same level as for employees on assignment in Sweden</li>
  <li>get insurance covering health, life, occupational injury and pension from your employer</li>
  <li>keep your UK employment contract</li>
  <li>be on UK or Swedish payroll</li>
</ul>

<p>A long-term ICT can take up to 3 months to get. You can’t extend it beyond the 3 years, or 1 year for trainees.</p>

<p>If you have a partner, or children under 18, they can join you with this permit type. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Permits-for-family-members.html" rel="external">Find out about permits for family members</a>.</p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>You need to check with the Swedish authorities on the exact process.
The following is a rough guide to help you prepare.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Your employer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Startpage.html" rel="external">creates an online account and applies for your work permit</a> with the Swedish Migration Agency. The website explains how once you’ve signed up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your employer submits the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Frequently-asked-questions-about-work-permits.html#Questionsandanswersontradeunionstatement" rel="external">union opinion</a>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You log in and complete the online application and submit the <a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer-documents">necessary documents</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You submit biometric information at the Swedish embassy and collect your biometric residence card permit when available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your employer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.av.se/en/work-environment-work-and-inspections/foreign-labour-in-sweden/Posting-foreign-labour-in-sweden/employers-obligations/" rel="external">submits a posted worker declaration</a> to the Swedish work environment authority (SWEA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your employer notifies the Swedish tax agency on the 12th day of the month following the day that you started working in Sweden.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Application documents</h4>

<p>Swedish authorities may request different documents. Usually, they need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK passport for you and any dependants, valid for the duration of the assignment and with 2 blank pages</li>
  <li>assignment letter or employment contract from your UK employer</li>
  <li>trainee agreement for trainees</li>
  <li>union statement (‘union opinion’)</li>
  <li>degree certificate for trainees</li>
  <li>marriage certificate or the equivalent for a registered partner, if applying with family, translated into English or Swedish by a certified translator</li>
  <li>documents showing you’ve lived together in another country for at least 6 months, if applying with a cohabiting partner, translated into English or Swedish by a certified translator</li>
  <li>birth certificate for any children joining you, translated into English or Swedish by a certified translator</li>
  <li>comprehensive health insurance that’s valid in Sweden for at least 3 months, or 1 year if the assignment is shorter than 1 year</li>
