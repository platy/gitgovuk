<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Switzerland.</p>

</div>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>This information is about living in Switzerland. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Switzerland.</a></p>
</div>

<p>If you started living in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare in Switzerland will stay the same for as long as you remain resident.</p>

<p>This guidance explains what you need to do in Switzerland depending on your circumstances.</p>

<p>You must have health insurance cover to live in Switzerland. You may still have to pay to use some parts of the healthcare system.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Swiss health system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>buying mandatory health insurance</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued S1 form with Switzerland’s central health insurance institution (‘Gemeinsame Einrichtung KVG’) (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Switzerland’ below)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Switzerland</h2>

<p>If you are planning on moving to Switzerland, see the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-switzerland">Living in Switzerland</a> for more information about visa and residency requirements.</p>

<p>Everyone who lives in Switzerland must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register as a resident</li>
  <li>get health insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>You choose your insurance provider from a list of government-approved providers. The <a href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Federal Office of Public Health</a> has more detailed information, including the list of insurers.</p>

<p>You’ll receive a health insurance card once you register.</p>

<p>Once you’re a resident you may also be entitled to a Swiss European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) for travel.</p>

<h3>If you were living in Switzerland before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you started living in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, your rights to access healthcare in Switzerland will stay the same for as long as you remain resident.</p>

<p>This means you may also be entitled to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Swiss <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel, including visits to the UK</li>
  <li>a UK S1 if you start drawing a UK State Pension (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Switzerland’ below)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to access healthcare services</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/switzerland-and-liechtenstein-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners" class="govuk-link">Find your nearest hospital or clinic</a> on this GOV.UK webpage.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>Even with insurance, you’ll probably still have to pay some costs. For example, most people will have to pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the first 300 Swiss francs towards your treatment per year ‒ this is the ‘deductible’ or ‘franchise’ and can be higher or lower depending on your insurance premium</li>
  <li>10% of your treatment costs over the deductible, up to a maximum of 700 Swiss francs (or 350 Swiss francs if you’re under 18 years old)</li>
  <li>a daily fee if you stay in hospital ‒ this is around 15 Swiss francs</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not have to pay a ‘deductible’ or daily hospital fees if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under 18 years old</li>
  <li>under 25 years old and in education or training</li>
  <li>a woman receiving maternity services</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Switzerland temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) country.</p>

<h3>Healthcare for posted workers who started before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>You can access healthcare in Switzerland using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or registered S1 form.</p>

<h3>Healthcare for posted workers moving to Switzerland</h3>

<p>You may need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>join a local healthcare scheme</li>
  <li>cover the cost of your healthcare with private health insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC has a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Switzerland</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance if you have an S1 as a posted worker (see ‘If your UK employer has sent you to Switzerland temporarily (‘posted workers’)’ above).</p>

<p>If you started living in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, you may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-switzerland">Swiss resident</a> and receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Swiss system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Switzerland on the same basis as a Swiss citizen.</p>

<p>You’ll also get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a> for travel</li>
  <li>
<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">planned treatments</a> in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Switzerland than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<p>If you’re entitled to an S1 form as a dependant of a State Pensioner, your health cover will be cancelled once you begin claiming your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You will be sent a new S1 form to your registered address from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services. You must register this form to ensure continuation of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>You are responsible for informing NHS Overseas Healthcare Services if you change your address or your circumstances change.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

NHS Overseas Healthcare Services
<br>Telephone: +44 (0)191 218 1999
<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension or another qualifying exportable benefit, and you started living in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services (see contact details above).</p>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Switzerland</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 form with Switzerland’s central health insurance institution (‘Gemeinsame Einrichtung KVG’).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kvg.org/en/domicile-in-switzerland-_content---1--1077.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Find out more about registering your S1 form</a></p>

<p>Once you’ve registered, you’ll receive an insurance card. This will mean you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Swiss citizen.</p>

<p>Show this card when you visit a doctor to prove you are entitled to healthcare. Check that the doctor you visit treats S1 holders.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you are experiencing delays registering your S1 with local authorities and require emergency or urgent treatment, contact the Overseas Healthcare Services on 0044 191 218 1999.</p>
</div>

<h2>Studying in Switzerland</h2>
<p>If you were already in Switzerland before 1 January 2021 because you study there, you need to <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/ehic">apply for a new UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> entitles you to medically necessary healthcare until the end of your study period in Switzerland.</p>

<h3>Students moving to Switzerland</h3>

<p>You cannot use a UK-issued <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) to get healthcare in Switzerland.</p>

<p>You should either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take out private travel insurance with healthcare coverage</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-switzerland" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> to get state health insurance and pay a student rate</li>
</ul>

<p>Speak to your university for further advice.</p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Because the NHS is a residency-based system, under NHS rules UK nationals who move abroad on a permanent basis may lose their entitlement to free NHS healthcare.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national and move to the EU, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK unless you have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, PRC or S2 to show your healthcare costs are funded by the EU country in which you now live, or another exemption applies.</p>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK war pensioners</li>
  <li>UK government employees</li>
  <li>UK nationals living in the EU on or before 31 December 2020, once they have a registered, UK-issued S1</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about using the NHS when you no longer live in the UK (see ‘UK nationals who no longer live in the UK’ in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-eu-and-efta-citizens-visiting-the-uk" class="govuk-link">Healthcare for visitors to the UK from the EU</a>).</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-nhs-when-you-return-to-live-in-the-uk" class="govuk-link">using the NHS when you return to live in the UK</a>.</p>
