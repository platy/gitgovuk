<h2>Stay up to date</h2>

<p>This guidance will be updated if anything changes to how you get state healthcare in Switzerland.</p>

</div>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>This information is about living in Switzerland. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare">There’s different guidance if you’re visiting Switzerland</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You must have health insurance cover to live in Switzerland. You may still have to pay to use some parts of the healthcare system.</p>

<p>UK nationals usually access the Swiss health system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>buying mandatory health insurance</li>
  <li>registering a UK-issued S1 form with Switzerland’s central health insurance institution (‘Gemeinsame Einrichtung KVG’) (see ‘UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Switzerland’ below)</li>
  <li>using a UK Global Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>) or European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>) for temporary stays when studying, or as a ‘posted’ (detached) worker</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare if you live and work in Switzerland</h2>

<p>If you are planning on moving to Switzerland, see the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-switzerland" class="govuk-link">Living in Switzerland</a> for more information about visa and residency requirements.</p>

<p>Everyone who lives in Switzerland must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register as a resident</li>
  <li>get health insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>You choose your insurance provider from a list of government-approved providers. The <a rel="external" href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home.html" class="govuk-link">Federal Office of Public Health</a> has more detailed information, including the list of insurers.</p>

<p>You’ll receive a health insurance card once you register.</p>

<p>Once you’re a resident you may also be entitled to a Swiss <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> for travel.</p>

<h3>How to access healthcare services</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/switzerland-and-liechtenstein-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners" class="govuk-link">Find your nearest hospital or clinic</a> on this GOV.UK webpage.</p>

<h3>How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>Even with insurance, you’ll probably still have to pay some costs. For example, most people will have to pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the first 300 Swiss francs towards your treatment per year ‒ this is the ‘deductible’ or ‘franchise’ and can be higher or lower depending on your insurance premium</li>
  <li>10% of your treatment costs over the deductible, up to a maximum of 700 Swiss francs (or 350 Swiss francs if you’re under 18 years old)</li>
  <li>a daily fee if you stay in hospital ‒ this is around 15 Swiss francs</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not have to pay a ‘deductible’ or daily hospital fees if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>under 18 years old</li>
  <li>under 25 years old and in education or training</li>
  <li>a woman receiving maternity services</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your UK employer has sent you to Switzerland temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A posted worker, also known as a ‘detached worker’, is someone employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to a European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) country.</p>

<p>UK posted workers may be able to access healthcare in Switzerland using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> or S1 form, if they are a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK national</li>
  <li>Swiss national</li>
  <li>EU citizen</li>
  <li>refugee</li>
  <li>stateless person</li>
  <li>dependant or survivor of someone with one of these nationalities or statuses</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<p>You should register your S1 with Switzerland’s central health insurance institution (‘Gemeinsame Einrichtung KVG’).</p>

<p>You may also need a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-insurance-for-workers-from-the-uk-working-in-the-eea-or-switzerland" class="govuk-link">UK-issued A1 certificate</a> to show that you pay national insurance in the UK. You can get this from HMRC.</p>

<p>If you’re using an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> or <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr>, you’ll need to show the card when you go to your appointment.</p>

<h2>UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 form in Switzerland</h2>

<p>There’s different guidance if you have an S1 as a posted worker (see ‘If your UK employer has sent you to Switzerland temporarily (‘posted workers’)’ above).</p>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you’re a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-switzerland" class="govuk-link">Swiss resident</a> and receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
</ul>

<p>You will only be eligible to receive an S1 to use in Switzerland if you are a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK national</li>
  <li>Swiss national</li>
  <li>EU citizen</li>
  <li>refugee</li>
  <li>stateless person</li>
  <li>dependant or survivor of someone with one of these nationalities or statuses</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 form if you’re a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>Once you have an S1 form, you must register it on the Swiss system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare in Switzerland on the same basis as a Swiss citizen.</p>

<p>Dependants and family members may be classified differently in Switzerland than the UK.</p>

<p>Check with the local authorities when you register your S1 form.</p>

<p>If you’re entitled to an S1 form as a dependant of a State Pensioner, your health cover will be cancelled once you begin claiming your UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You will be sent a new S1 form to your registered address from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services. You must register this form to ensure continuation of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>You are responsible for informing NHS Overseas Healthcare Services if you change your address or your circumstances change.</p>

<br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
<br>Saturday, 9am to 3pm
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>How to get an S1 form</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension or another qualifying exportable benefit, and you started living in Switzerland before 1 January 2021, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services (see contact details above).</p>

<h3>How to use an S1 form in Switzerland</h3>

<p>You must register your S1 form with Switzerland’s central health insurance institution (‘Gemeinsame Einrichtung KVG’).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kvg.org/en/domicile-in-switzerland-_content---1--1077.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Find out more about registering your S1 form</a></p>

<p>Once you’ve registered, you’ll receive an insurance card. This will mean you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Swiss citizen.</p>

<p>Show this card when you visit a doctor to prove you are entitled to healthcare. Check that the doctor you visit treats S1 holders.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you are experiencing delays registering your S1 with local authorities and require emergency or urgent treatment, contact the Overseas Healthcare Services on 0044 191 218 1999.</p>
</div>

<h2>Studying in Switzerland</h2>

<p>You should apply for a Student <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> to get state-provided, medically necessary healthcare for the duration of your study period in Switzerland, whether this is for part or all of your course. This means that you’ll get necessary healthcare services on the same basis as a Swiss citizen either for free or at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>You may only use your <abbr title="UK Global Health Insurance Card">GHIC</abbr> in Switzerland if you are a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK national</li>
  <li>Swiss national</li>
  <li>EU citizen</li>
  <li>refugee</li>
  <li>stateless person</li>
  <li>dependant or survivor of someone with one of these nationalities or statuses</li>
</ul>

<p>If you already hold a valid Student <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> you can use this until the card expires.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/">Read more about eligibility and how to apply</a></p>

<h2>Getting treatment in the UK</h2>
<p>Because the NHS is a residency-based system, under NHS rules UK nationals who move abroad on a permanent basis may lose their entitlement to free NHS healthcare.</p>

<p>If you are a UK national and move to Switzerland, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK unless you have an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, PRC or S2 to show your healthcare costs are funded by Switzerland, or another exemption applies.</p>

<p>Some former UK residents do not have to pay for NHS treatment when visiting England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK war pensioners</li>
  <li>UK government employees</li>
  <li>UK nationals living in the EU on or before 31 December 2020, once they have a registered, UK-issued S1</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about using the NHS when you no longer live in the UK (see ‘UK nationals who no longer live in the UK’ in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/healthcare-for-eu-and-efta-citizens-visiting-the-uk">Healthcare for visitors to the UK from the EU</a>).</p>

<p>If you return to live in the UK you’ll be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.</p>
