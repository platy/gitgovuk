<h2>Service issues</h2>

<h3>Annual investment allowance</h3>

<p>The Autumn Budget 2021 extended the annual investment allowance provisional £1 million cap until 31 March 2023. The extension of the temporary £1 million cap was originally due to revert to £200,000 on 1 January 2022, but this will now happen on 1 April 2023.</p>

<p>The Corporation Tax online service will be updated to reflect this change in summer 2022. You can file online before the service is updated if you’re filing a return and you do not need to claim this additional annual investment allowance.</p>

<h3>Loans to participators</h3>

<p>The Autumn Budget 2021 raised the rate of tax charged under section 455 on loans to participators from 32.5% to 33.75% from 6 April 2022.</p>

<p>The Corporation Tax online service will be updated to reflect this change in summer 2022. You can file online before the service is updated if you’re filing a return and you do not need to report this increase.</p>

<h3>Research and Development claims</h3>

<p>In 2021, HMRC introduced supplementary form CT600L for companies claiming either of the following credits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>small and medium enterprise (<abbr title="small and medium enterprise">SME</abbr>) Research and Development payable tax credit</li>
  <li>Research and Development expenditure credit</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies only claiming Research and Development enhanced expenditure do not need to complete this supplementary form and just use box 660 on the CT600 to report their claim.</p>

<p>Due to a recent update to the CT600 and CT600L forms, HMRC are aware that a small number of customers may have online filing issues because of some restrictions within the revised HMRC Corporation Tax online service.</p>

<h4>Companies claiming Research and Development enhanced expenditure, but not <abbr title="small and medium enterprise">SME</abbr> payable tax credit or Research and Development expenditure credit</h4>

<p>You will only be affected if both the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your accounting period starts on or after 1 April 2022</li>
  <li>you’re only claiming Research and Development enhanced expenditure (included in box 660) but no other Research and Development credits so would not be completing a CT600L</li>
</ul>

<h4>Companies claiming Research and Development expenditure credit and reporting Income Tax deducted from profits</h4>

<p>You will only be affected if you are reporting both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an amount carried forward under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/4/section/104N" rel="external">section 104N(2), step 2</a> of the Corporation Tax Act 2009, from a previous accounting period (included in box L5)</li>
  <li>Income Tax deducted from profits (included in box L35)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Small and Medium Enterprise companies claiming Research and Development expenditure credit but not&nbsp;<abbr title="small and medium enterprise">SME</abbr>&nbsp;payable tax credit</h4>

<p>You will be affected if you are reporting Research and Development expenditure credit claims in boxes L185 and L190 but not claiming Research and Development payable tax credit in box L170.</p>

<h4>Companies claiming Small and Medium Enterprise Payable Tax Credit</h4>

<p>If you’re claiming Research and Development payable tax credit in box L170, for an accounting period starting on or after 1 April 2021, you must give additional information by completing either of the new boxes L167 or L168. The online service has currently applied this rule to all accounting periods.</p>

<p>If your accounting period starts before the 1 April 2021 and your software has not been updated or you choose not to provide this additional information you may be affected by this issue.</p>

<p>The service will be updated in summer 2022 to fix the Research and Development issues and if you’re affected, you should wait until then to file your return.</p>

<p>If you have an urgent requirement to file your return before the service is updated HMRC&nbsp;will accept a paper return.</p>

<p>In this instance, you should file a paper return which must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/company-tax-return-it-problems">form WT1</a>, explaining (in box 6) that your Research and Development claim cannot be filed online — place this form under your return</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/corporation-tax-company-tax-return-ct600-2015-version-3">form CT600</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/corporation-tax-research-and-development-ct600l-2021-version-3">form CT600L</a></li>
  <li>your accounts and computations</li>
</ul>

<p>Send your paper return to:</p>

<br>HM Revenue and Customs

<br>United Kingdom
<br>

<h4>Companies claiming Research and Development expenditure credit and reporting an amount of brought forward step 2 restriction to be carried forward to the next accounting period</h4>

<p>This is for information only as it will not affect your ability to submit a CT600L to the HMRC Corporation Tax online service.</p>

<p>A new pre-step 1 section has been added to the CT600L for you to report the amount of step 2 restriction brought forward from previous accounting periods. Any balance not used and carried forward to the next accounting period is captured in new boxes L8 and L129.</p>

<p>The figure in box L129 is correctly included in box L140 — balance carried forward to next accounting period, but has been captured twice in box L150 — total carried forward to next accounting period. This means that your software will be reporting an incorrect figure in box L150, but this is used by HMRC for statistical purposes only.</p>

<p>The figure in box L129 will be the one included in box L5 in your next Corporation Tax Self Assessment.</p>
