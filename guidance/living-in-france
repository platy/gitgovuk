<h2 id="residency-and-visas">Residency and visas</h2>

<p>You may want to check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france/entry-requirements">entry requirements for France</a>.</p>

<p>After the UK leaves the EU, there will be a new registration system and you will need to change your registration document for a new card.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, you will have until at least June 2021 to do this. The agreement on citizens’ rights will allow UK nationals to stay in their Member State of residence after the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, UK nationals living in France on the day the UK leaves the EU will be given a grace period of one year to obtain their residence card. You will have six months from the day the UK leaves the EU to apply for your card and a year to receive it.</p>

<p>During this grace period, you will retain your right of residence, and associated work and social rights. European cartes de séjour that have already been issued will also remain valid. However, whether or not you hold a carte de séjour, you must apply for a residence card under the new system during the first six months of the grace period.</p>

<p>Your status upon applying for the new residence card will depend on which card you should apply for. The categories are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK nationals who have been living in France for five years or more</li>
  <li>UK nationals who have been living in France for less than five years and fall under one of the below categories:</li>
  <li>Salaried worker with a Contrat à Durée Indéterminée (CDI)</li>
  <li>Salaried worker with a Contrat à Durée Déterminée (CDD)</li>
  <li>Self- employed</li>
  <li>During the last year have either graduated in France or worked for at least three months and are now looking for work or creating a business.</li>
  <li>Students</li>
  <li>Family members of British Nationals who qualify for one of the above categories</li>
  <li>UK nationals who have been living in France for less than five years but do not fulfil any of the above categories.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications for a residence card will cost €119.</p>

<p>The French Ministry of Interior have detailed this information in an ordonnance and accompanying decree. You can read <a rel="external" href="https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Actualites/Le-ministere-de-l-Interieur-se-prepare-au-Brexit/Sejour">their question and answers on residency (in French)</a>. We have also provided a non-official English translation below. The French Government will shortly be updating their Q&A and will communicate details of the application process. However, in anticipation of this, you should start to gather together relevant documents like bank statements and household bills, to show you have been lawfully resident in France.</p>

<p>Before the UK leaves the EU, you can still apply for a carte de séjour at your local prefecture under the current system. However, if you have not yet had your appointment by the day the UK leaves the EU, you may be asked to begin the application process again. If your residency application is refused or you think it has been handled incorrectly by your prefecture, <a rel="external" href="https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=France&post=British%20Embassy%20Paris">please contact British Embassy Paris</a>. You should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information about the issue</li>
  <li>when the event took place</li>
  <li>which préfecture (département) it relates to</li>
</ul>

<p>We will provide feedback to the French Ministry of the Interior and push for improvements if needed.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">apply for or renew your British passport from France</a>. If you cannot get a passport in time, you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">get an emergency travel document or ‘emergency passport’</a>.</p>

<h3 id="passports-and-travel-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Passports and travel after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>You should <a rel="external" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/check-a-passport">check your passport is valid for travel</a> before you book your trip.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there will be new travel rules.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the European Commission has said <a rel="external" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6402_en.htm">you may not need visas for short stays</a>  elsewhere in the Schengen area or the EU. You may be able to stay up to 90 days in any EU country, within a 180 day period, without a visa.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, nothing will change until the end of 2020. During this period, you can continue to travel freely in the Schengen area with your UK passport. What happens after 2020 will form the next part of negotiations.</p>

<p>You should read the French government’s <a rel="external" href="https://brexit.gouv.fr/sites/brexit/accueil/vous-etes-britannique/niveau-3-Modalit%C3%A9-de-voyage.html">website on travel to France after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-in-france">Healthcare</h2>

<p>You should ensure that you are correctly registered for healthcare as a resident in France, and if necessary, for health insurance. Please read the NHS guidance on who is able to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-france/">access healthcare in France, and how to register</a>.</p>

<p>If you are legally resident in France, you can get a French social security card for healthcare (carte vitale). To get a French social security card, you will need to register with your local Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie (CPAM). They can tell you which documents they need for your registration. Top-up insurance cover (mutuelle) also exists to cover the cost of healthcare not covered by a Carte Vitale.</p>

<h3 id="ehic-cards">EHIC cards</h3>

<p>If you are resident in France, you should not be using a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from the UK to access healthcare in France.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may use an EHIC to access state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland.</li>
  <li>The EHIC covers treatment that is medically necessary until your planned return home.</li>
  <li>An EHIC is not a replacement for comprehensive travel insurance.</li>
  <li>For more information you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">read our travel advice page</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance#eu-exit-update">advice on foreign travel insurance</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="state-healthcare--s1">State healthcare — S1</h3>

<p>If you live in France and receive an exportable UK pension, contribution-based Employment Support Allowance or another exportable benefit, you may currently be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK. You will need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 certificate.</p>

<p>You can read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-france/">NHS’s guidance on France</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the NHS’s guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/">healthcare and studying abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs">check your prescriptions are legal</a> in France.</p>

<p>You can find information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-experiencing-mental-health-difficulties-in-france">mental health in France</a>.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Healthcare after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your current rights on access to healthcare in France will remain the same until 31 December 2020, as long as you remain a resident in France.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your access to healthcare is likely to change. If you are a permanent or temporary resident, you should review the status of your healthcare cover.</p>

<p>Under new legislation, the French government has proposed that UK pension holders that are currently entitled to S1 healthcare will continue to be entitled to healthcare for up to 2 years. This is while arrangements are negotiated to provide similar agreements for French citizens.</p>

<p>Healthcare entitlements from employment in France should not be affected.</p>

<p>Your EHIC may not be valid in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The UK has offered to maintain the EHIC scheme should the UK leave the EU without a deal; however, this is reliant on France continuing to accept UK EHICs.</p>

<p>You should take action now to confirm your residency status and decide what steps you need to take to ensure access to healthcare if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. UK nationals will be able to return to the UK for treatment.</p>

<p>You should read <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/healthcare-when-travelling-abroad/healthcare-in-france/">the NHS’s guidance on healthcare for UK nationals in France and how it may change after the UK leaves the EU</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-france">Working in France</h2>

<p>You should read our guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad">working in another EU country</a>.</p>

<p>You may need a:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/acro_std.aspx?id=2379">UK police certificate</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.acro.police.uk/Subject_Access_Online.aspx">UK equivalent of a casier judiciare</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="working-in-france-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Working in France after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, your right to work will stay the same until the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves without a deal, UK nationals living and working in France on the day the UK leaves the EU will keep their right to work for a period of one year whilst their application for a residence card is in process <a href="#visas-and-residency">(see residency)</a>. If you are living and working in France on the day the UK leaves the EU, this residence card will allow you to keep your right to work.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to start a business, provide a service, or do a job in a regulated profession after the UK leaves the EU, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/france-providing-services-after-eu-exit">further guidance can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="money-and-tax">Money and tax</h2>

<p>The UK has a double-taxation agreement with France to ensure people do not pay tax on the same income in both countries.</p>

<p>You should read the guidance about:
* <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-right-retire-abroad-return-to-uk">tax if you leave the UK to live  abroad</a> 
* <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/taxed-twice">tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a>.
* <a rel="external" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/france/index_en.htm">paying income tax in France</a> by the European Union</p>

<p>We recommend you get professional advice on paying tax in France. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/france-list-of-lawyers">Find an English-speaking lawyer in France</a>.</p>

<h3 id="declaration-of-assets">Declaration of assets</h3>

<p>All residents must declare any assets held outside France, including bank accounts, securities, rights, insurance, annuities and property. This declaration is separate to the annual tax return.</p>

<h3 id="national-insurance">National Insurance</h3>

<p>You may be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-if-you-go-abroad">pay National Insurance while abroad</a> in order to protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances.</p>

<h3 id="money-and-tax-after-the-uk-leaves-the-eu">Money and tax after the UK leaves the EU</h3>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it may become more expensive to use your UK bank card in France.</p>

<p>The UK leaving the European Union will not change existing double taxation arrangements for UK nationals living in France. You should direct individual taxpayer questions about double taxation to the relevant tax authority.</p>

<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>

<p>You will need to tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/moving-or-retiring-abroad">moving or retiring abroad</a>.</p>

<p>If you retire in France, you can claim:</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The French government has also said that UK nationals with less than five years’ residence who receive the Revenu de Solidarite Active (RSA) prior to the UK’s exit from the EU will be able to continue receiving the RSA benefit for a period of a year. Eligible UK nationals with more than five years’ residence will also be able to continue receiving the benefit during the grace period and beyond.</p>
