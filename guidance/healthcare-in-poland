<p>This information is about living in Poland. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-residents-visiting-the-eueea-and-switzerland-healthcare" class="govuk-link">There is different guidance about visiting Poland.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Poland has an insurance-based healthcare system.</p>

<p>If you’re not insured, you may be charged for using state healthcare services.
At the moment, UK nationals usually access the Polish healthcare system in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paying insurance contributions to the Polish state health system state through their employer</li>
  <li>paying voluntary insurance contributions  to the Polish state health system directly</li>
  <li>taking out private health insurance</li>
  <li>using a UK-issued EHIC for temporary stays</li>
  <li>registering an UK-issued S1 with the Polish state health system</li>
</ul>

<p>The S1 certificate entitles UK nationals access to state healthcare on the same basis as a Polish citizen. You’re entitled to an S1 if you receive a UK State Pension or certain other benefits. <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">Find out more about the S1.</a></p>

<h2 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period">Healthcare during the transition period</h2>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals visiting or living in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC during this time, as you did before.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Poland or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Poland as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency. This guidance explains what you need to do in Poland depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-if-you-live-and-work-in-poland">Healthcare if you live and work in Poland</h2>
<p>If you’re employed, monthly insurance contributions to the National Health Fund (NFZ) are taken from your salary before you’re paid.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not working, you can pay <a rel="external" href="http://www.nfz-lublin.pl/voluntary_health_insurance" class="govuk-link">voluntary insurance contributions</a> directly to the National Health Fund each month. You cannot do this if you’re registered as unemployed in Poland.</p>

<p>Your dependants will be covered by your insurance if they do not have their own.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-register">How to register</h3>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-poland" class="govuk-link">register as a resident</a> at the administrative offices of your provincial authority.</p>

<p>You then need to register with the National Health Fund.</p>

<p>If you work for a Polish employer, they will register you.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not working, go to your regional branch of the National Health Fund.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.nfz-lublin.pl/voluntary_health_insurance" class="govuk-link">Find out what documents you need to bring from the National Health Fund website.</a></p>

<p>Show ID and proof of your insurance when you visit a doctor.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-youll-pay">How much you’ll pay</h3>
<p>Monthly contributions cost 9% of your salary if you’re employed.</p>

<p>If you’re self-employed or not working, monthly contributions are based on national average salary.</p>

<p>State medical services are free if you pay insurance contributions, but you need to pay for some prescription medicines.</p>

<p>You can use some private medical facilities for free, if the facility has a signed contract with the Polish state health system.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-you-live-and-work-in-poland">Healthcare during the transition period if you live and work in Poland</h3>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>If you’re living in Poland or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Poland as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>This means you’ll also have the right to apply for a <a href="#s1" class="govuk-link">UK S1</a> if you start drawing a UK State Pension.</p>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="posted-worker">If your UK employer has sent you to Poland temporarily (‘posted workers’)</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/working-abroad/posted-workers" class="govuk-link">posted worker</a> is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK, but temporarily sent to another European Economic Area (EEA) country.</p>

<p>Currently, posted workers can use an EHIC or an S1 certificate to access Polish healthcare.</p>

<p>HMRC has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">helpline for National Insurance enquiries from non-UK residents</a>. They can answer questions about posted worker status and explain which documents you will need to get healthcare while posted.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-youre-a-posted-worker">Healthcare during the transition period if you’re a posted worker</h3>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC or S1 during this time, as you did before.</p>

<h2 id="s1">UK-funded healthcare: getting and using an S1 in Poland</h2>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Poland and receive either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>some other ‘exportable benefits’</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Not all UK benefits that can be claimed while abroad entitle you to UK-funded healthcare. Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/where-you-can-claim-benefits" class="govuk-link">claiming benefits if you move abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus" class="govuk-link">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> to ask about a benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>You may also be entitled to an S1 if you’re a <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">posted worker</a> or a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another). You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents" class="govuk-link">contact HMRC National Insurance enquiries</a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<p>Once you have an S1 certificate, you must register it on the Polish system.</p>

<p>This will mean you and your dependants will be entitled to healthcare on the same basis as  a Polish citizen.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-an-s1">How to get an S1</h3>
<p>If you have a UK State Pension, you must request an application form by phone from NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<br></br>Telephone: 0191 218 1999
<br></br>Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm
<br></br>
</p></div></div>

<h3 id="how-to-use-an-s1-in-poland">How to use an S1 in Poland</h3>
<p>You must register your S1 with the National Health Fund.</p>

<p>Once registered, you will be given a certificate confirming your registration with NFZ. This shows that you’re entitled to healthcare on the same basis as a Polish citizen.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-you-use-an-s1">Healthcare during the transition period if you use an S1</h3>
<p>There is different guidance <a href="#posted-worker" class="govuk-link">if you have an S1 as a posted worker</a>.</p>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK S1 holders in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and 
Switzerland before the end of 2020 if you’re either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone with an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>someone with another ‘exportable benefit’</li>
  <li>a frontier worker (someone who works in one state and lives in another)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re living in Poland or move there permanently before the end of 2020, you’ll have life-long healthcare rights in Poland as you do now, provided you remain legally resident.</p>

<p>This means that you’ll get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continued access to healthcare in Poland using your UK-issued S1</li>
  <li>a UK-issued EHIC for travelling to other countries in the EU</li>
  <li>planned treatments in other EU countries via the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/what-is-the-s2-route/" class="govuk-link">S2 route</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to register or apply for residency depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="moving-back-to-the-uk">Moving back to the UK</h2>
<p>If you return to the UK permanently you will be able to use the NHS like any other UK resident.
Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-nhs-when-you-return-to-live-in-the-uk" class="govuk-link">using the NHS when you return to live in the UK</a>.</p>

<h2 id="studying-in-poland">Studying in Poland</h2>
<p>You can apply for a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/moving-abroad/studying-abroad/" class="govuk-link">student EHIC</a>. This is different from a normal EHIC, and entitles you to cover for longer.</p>

<p>An EHIC is not a replacement for travel insurance. You should also have insurance to cover the duration of your course.</p>

<h3 id="healthcare-during-the-transition-period-if-youre-studying-in-poland">Healthcare during the transition period if you’re studying in Poland</h3>

<p>There will be no changes to healthcare access for UK nationals in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>You can continue to use your EHIC during this time, as you did before.</p>

<p>If you started studying in Poland before the end of 2020, your student EHIC will be valid for the rest of the time you study there.</p>
