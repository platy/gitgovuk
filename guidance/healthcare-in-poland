<p>A Brexit deal has been agreed but needs to be ratified. The UK could still leave with no deal on 31 October 2019 if the UK and EU do not approve and sign the withdrawal agreement.</p>

<p>This page tells you how to prepare for Brexit and will be updated if anything changes. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/email-signup/?topic=/government/brexit">Sign up for email alerts</a> to get the latest information.</p>
</div>

<p>This content was originally published on the NHS website.</p>

<h2 id="brexit-healthcare">Healthcare in Poland after Brexit</h2>

<p>You should be ready for possible changes to your access to healthcare if there is a no-deal Brexit and you are a UK national living in or visiting Poland.</p>

<p>You should review your access to healthcare now. There may be a gap or permanent change in how you access healthcare if there is no deal and no agreements with Poland in place. For example, if you are a current S1 form holder, or a posted worker or student using a <a href="#ehic">European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</a> you will not be able to rely on these to access your healthcare as you do now.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-live-in-poland">If you live in Poland</h3>

<p>You need to make the best decisions for your circumstances and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-poland#visas-and-residency">registering to live in Poland</a></li>
  <li>registering for healthcare under the local rules and legislation of Poland</li>
  <li>buying comprehensive health insurance while you are applying for residency or if you are not eligible for local schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all the right documentation and it is up to date.</p>

<p>You must demonstrate you have state or private healthcare insurance in Poland to gain residency. You can find more information on the <a rel="external" href="https://udsc.gov.pl/en/">Office for Foreigners website</a> or on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-poland#visas-and-residency">guide to living in Poland</a>.</p>

<p>When you have completed the residency process you’ll be issued with a PESEL number (individual identification number), which you need to be able to register at a health clinic.</p>

<p>If you’re a UK national resident in Poland and are registered with, and pay contributions to, the National Health Fund (<abbr title="National Health Fund">NFZ</abbr>), you’ll have the same entitlement to healthcare as a Polish national.</p>

<p>Polish official advice states that if people are not able to pay into the state system, or if they opt out, they must secure private insurance and pay fees to use state health services.</p>

<h3 id="s1-certificate-holders">S1 certificate holders</h3>

<p>Your S1 certificate may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Poland and might mean you have to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="studying-in-poland-after-brexit">Studying in Poland after Brexit</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid after exit day if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Poland and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>If you’re already studying in Poland before the UK leaves the EU, the UK will cover your healthcare costs for the duration of your course.</p>

<p>Students starting courses after the UK leaves the EU should ensure they have comprehensive healthcare cover in place.</p>

<h3 id="get-help-paying-for-medical-treatment-after-brexit">Get help paying for medical treatment after Brexit</h3>

<p>During the first 6 months after Brexit, if you need medical treatment and you’re being asked to pay for it, the UK can help.</p>

<p>This may be through arrangements with the country you live in, or by paying your healthcare provider directly.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<h3 id="using-nhs-services-when-visiting-the-uk">Using NHS services when visiting the UK</h3>

<p>You should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free if you’re living in Poland and are not currently eligible for a UK-issued S1 form or <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>. You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.</p>

<p>You may use NHS services in England, Scotland and Wales without charge after Brexit if you are living in Poland before exit day and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a UK-issued S1 form</li>
  <li>have a UK-issued European Health Insurance Card (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>would have been eligible for the UK to fund your healthcare access, if exit day had not occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>This will remain the case after exit day.</p>

<h3 id="returning-to-the-uk-permanently">Returning to the UK permanently</h3>

<p>If you meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-residence">ordinary residence test</a> you will be able to access NHS care without charge.</p>

<h3 id="ehic">European Health Insurance Cards (<abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> may not be valid if there is a no-deal Brexit. This will depend on whether the UK has an arrangement with Poland and might mean you need to pay in full for treatment.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Poland.</p>

<p>Check your insurance has the necessary healthcare cover to ensure you can get any treatment you might need. If you have any pre-existing conditions, talk with your insurer about how to get the right cover, and how this affects your travel.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> can be used to access UK-funded treatment if your visit or treatment started before exit day until you return to the UK.</p>

<p>To organise a payment, you’ll need to give your healthcare provider’s details to the NHS Business Services Authority’s Overseas Healthcare Services.</p>

<p>Call the NHS Business Services Authority on +44 (0)191 218 1999 for more information. Lines are open Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm and Saturday 9am to 3pm (UK time).</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This information is about healthcare in Poland before Brexit. <a href="#brexit-healthcare">Find out about healthcare for UK nationals living in Poland after Brexit</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>UK nationals living or working in Poland must follow the registration process to access the same entitlements to healthcare as Polish nationals.</p>

<p>If you’re going to work in Poland and make national insurance contributions, you’ll be entitled to state-run healthcare on the same basis as a Polish national.</p>

<p>All those employed in Poland, including foreigners, are obliged to possess health insurance. Employers pay a contribution on the employee’s behalf to the National Health Fund (<abbr title="National Health Fund">NFZ</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you receive UK pension to your Polish bank account, you are likely to be paying contributions to the National Health Fund (<abbr title="National Health Fund">NFZ</abbr>). You should contact <a rel="external" href="http://www.nfz.gov.pl/">National Heath Fund</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://lang.zus.pl/en/">Polish National Insurance Institution (ZUS)</a> in order to review and check your status.</p>

<p>Immediate family members of the insured person may also benefit from free medical assistance following registration with the <abbr title="National Health Fund">NFZ</abbr>. Family members include a spouse, children and parents if they live in 1 household.</p>

<p>If you are not covered by state healthcare in Poland, you can join the public system by paying voluntary contributions to the National Health Fund. You should check information provided by the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nfz.gov.pl/dla-pacjenta/zalatw-sprawe-krok-po-kroku/jak-ubezpieczyc-sie-dobrowolnie/">National Healthcare Fund (in Polish)</a> and review your situation.</p>

<p>Private services can be accessed using state health insurance where the National Health Fund has agreements in place. Where there are no agreements, fees will be incurred.</p>

<p>If you have become unemployed, you can maintain access to state healthcare if you can show that in the previous 18 months you have been in employment for 365 days. In this instance, the Labour Office will pay the insurance contributions.</p>

<h3 id="uk-posted-workers">UK posted workers</h3>

<p>If you’re a worker posted to Poland by a UK company, you may be entitled to health cover funded by the UK in the country you’re posted to.</p>

<p>You can find out more from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-insurance-enquiries-for-employees-and-individuals">contact HMRC about health cover abroad (UK residents)</a></li>

<p>You may be entitled to state healthcare paid for by the UK if you live in Poland and receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exportable UK State Pension</li>
  <li>a contribution-based Employment Support Allowance</li>
  <li>another exportable benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to apply for a certificate of entitlement known as an S1 form.</p>

<p>An S1 certificate helps you and your dependants access healthcare in Poland. If you have an S1 certificate, it’ll be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>You may be eligible for an S1 certificate, if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive certain UK benefits, such as a UK State Pension</li>
  <li>are employed by a UK body or firm (you are a posted or frontier worker)</li>
  <li>are a dependant of someone who has an S1 certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://contactcentreservices.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/selfnhsukokb/AskUs_EHIC/en-gb/6696/application-forms-and-evidence/16477/s1-form-what-is-this-and-how-do-i-obtain-one">apply for an S1 certificate</a> through the Business Services Authority.</p>

<p>If you receive a UK State Pension, you can apply for your certificate via the Overseas Healthcare Service on +44 (0) 191 218 1999 (option 5).</p>

<p>It is possible to apply for an S1 certificate until the UK leaves the EU. It is important to have all the right documentation and that it is up to date.</p>

<p>For other exportable benefits, you may need to contact a different team depending on the exportable benefit.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad">claiming benefits if you live, move or travel abroad</a>. Please note that different exportable benefits can have different rules in terms of healthcare cover.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-poland">Foreign and Commonwealth Office (<abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>)</a> provides information about what UK and Polish benefits are available to Britons living in Poland.</p>

<p>UK-issued EHICs will still be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>Make sure you have comprehensive travel insurance if you’re planning to visit Poland.</p>

<p>The government always advises UK nationals to take out comprehensive travel insurance when going overseas.

<p>Emergency medical care is provided to anyone requiring urgent attention. You can expect to be charged in full for any care provided without an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> enables you to access necessary state-provided healthcare in Poland at a reduced cost, or sometimes for free if you’re staying there temporarily.</p>

<p>Make sure you are treated by a healthcare provider in the state system as you will not be covered for private healthcare with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Remember to keep all receipts and any paperwork.</p>

<h3 id="people-with-pre-existing-health-conditions">People with pre-existing health conditions</h3>

<p>You should buy medical travel insurance before visiting Poland if you have a pre-existing health condition.</p>

<p>You must tell the insurance company about any pre-existing health conditions you have to make sure you can get the cover you need.</p>

<p>The Money and Pensions Advice Service has information about <a rel="external" href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/travel-insurance-for-over-65s-and-medical-conditions">buying travel insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions</a>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr> will be valid until the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>If you have a pre-existing condition that will need treatment while abroad, ask your doctor in the UK for advice before you travel. Take any documents about your health condition or medication with you.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling to have planned medical treatment, read the NHS guide to <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/going-abroad-for-medical-treatment/">seeking medical treatment in Europe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-services-in-poland">Healthcare services in Poland</h2>

<h3 id="finding-help-in-an-emergency">Finding help in an emergency</h3>

<p>If you have a serious life-threatening emergency or you need an ambulance, you should call 112. This number is free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="dentists">Dentists</h3>

<p>Dental treatment is available both privately and under the state healthcare system if you are registered with the National Health Fund.</p>

<h3 id="hospitals">Hospitals</h3>

<p>You’ll need to be referred by a doctor for any hospital treatment.</p>

<p>The following services require a referral:</p>

<ul>
  <li>outpatient specialist care</li>
  <li>hospital treatment</li>
  <li>therapeutic rehabilitation</li>
  <li>care for chronic illnesses</li>

  <li>oncology</li>
  <li>psychiatry</li>
  <li>venereology</li>

<p>Make sure you are treated by a healthcare provider in the state system as you will not be covered for private healthcare with an <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions</h3>

<p>Prescriptions are charged at 100%, 50%, 30% or 0% of the total medicine cost. This depends on the product and your individual circumstances.</p>

<p>When using your <abbr title="European Health Insurance Card">EHIC</abbr>, people of working age are charged 50% and pensioners are charged about 10%.</p>

<p>Pensioners will have to declare they receive a UK State Pension to pay the lower rate.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-own-medicines-to-poland">Bringing your own medicines to Poland</h2>

<p>Some prescribed medicines contain drugs that are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in the UK. This means that additional legal controls apply to these medicines.</p>
