<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<h3>1.1 What this notice is about</h3>

<p>This notice helps you complete the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return and provides information on how to submit your completed return to HMRC. It will guide you through the form, box by box. It also contains some special advice for those using <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting schemes and information about submitting your return electronically.</p>

<p>Make sure that you read any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> notices relevant to your circumstances before you complete your return.</p>

<h3>1.2 Online returns</h3>

<p>Virtually all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses are required by law to submit their returns online and pay electronically. You will not have to do this if either of the following apply, HMRC is satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your business is run entirely by practising members of a religious society whose beliefs prevent them from using computers</li>
  <li>it is not possible for you to use a computer to submit your returns, for reasons of age, disability or remoteness of location</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think either of these apply to you then contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> helpline</a> to discuss alternative arrangements.</p>

<p>You will not have to file returns online if you’re subject to an insolvency procedure, but if you’ve an approved Voluntary Arrangement you can submit online.</p>

<p>You can find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-vat-return">online <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Returns</a>. The benefits include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a safe and secure method of sending your return</li>
  <li>an on-screen acknowledgement that we’ve got your return</li>
  <li>an option to get an electronic reminder when your return is due</li>
  <li>automatic calculations to reduce errors when completing the return</li>
  <li>up to 7 extra calendar days to submit your return and pay any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due (compared with the due date for paper returns and cheques sent by post) — and if you pay by Direct Debit online at least 10 extra calendar days to pay</li>
</ul>

<p>There are <a class="govuk-link" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageOnlineServices_FAQs&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_026374" rel="external">legal conditions</a> that apply to submitting returns online and getting the extra time for paying electronically.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">Section 5</a> contains more information.</p>

<h2>2. Explanation of some common <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> terms</h2>

<p>This section gives a brief summary of some of the common terms you’ll come across as you read this notice. But, if you’re completing a return for the first time, it might be helpful to look at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/business-tax/vat"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>2.1 Supplies</h3>

<p>This is the term for the sale of goods or services which you make by way of business. All goods and services that are subject to <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> (at the standard, reduced or zero rate) are called ‘taxable supplies’.</p>

<h3>2.2 Output <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h3>

<p>This is the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on your sales of goods or services. These sales are known as outputs. Output <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> (or output tax) is the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you charge and collect from your customers on goods or services going out of the business if you’re registered for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>

<h3>2.3 Input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h3>

<p>This is the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> that you can claim on amounts paid to your suppliers for goods and services that you buy for your business. These purchases are known as inputs. Input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> (or input tax) is the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you can reclaim on goods and services coming in to your business if you’re registered for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you make, or intend to make, both taxable and exempt supplies and you incur input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> that relates to both kinds of supply, you’re classified as ‘partly exempt’. Your recovery of input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in such circumstances is subject to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-706-partial-exemption">partial exemption rules</a>.</p>

<h3>2.4 Tax due</h3>

<p>Your return asks you to record the output <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> payable to us and the input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you can claim back from us. If the output <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is greater than the input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, you’ll owe the difference to us. This is a tax due return.</p>

<p>If the input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you can claim is greater than the output <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you owe, you’ll be due a repayment of <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> from us. This is a repayment return.</p>

<h3>2.5 <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> period</h3>

<p>The top of your return will show the inclusive dates that the return covers. For example, if you submit quarterly returns and the end date shown on the return is 31 March 2018, then it will cover the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2018 and be called period 03/18. If it ends on 31 August 2018, your return period will be called 08/18.</p>

<h3>2.6 Tax point</h3>

<p>There are rules for working out the time when a supply of goods or services is treated as taking place. This is called the tax point. You must account for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> period that the tax point occurs in at the rate in force at that time unless you use the <a class="govuk-link" href="#para42">Cash Accounting Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>2.7 Imports</h3>

<p>These are goods and related costs that you buy for your business from suppliers outside the UK or if you are bringing these into Northern Ireland, from outside the EU. You can reclaim any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> that you pay on these goods as input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, subject to the normal rules (read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/imports-and-vat-notice-702">Imports (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 702)</a>).</p>

<h3>2.8 Acquisitions</h3>

<p>These are goods that you bring into Northern Ireland from EU member states. You may have to account for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, but you can also recover that <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> as input tax.</p>

<p>These are the goods that you buy from a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered business in the UK or an EU member state and are dispatched or removed into the UK. You may have to account for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in the UK (referred to as ‘acquisition tax’), but you can also recover that <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> as input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, subject to normal rules.</p>

<h3>2.9 Exports</h3>

<p>These are goods that are supplied from England, Scotland or Wales to customers outside the UK, or goods supplied from Northern Ireland to customers outside the EU. These supplies are normally zero-rated, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-on-goods-exported-from-the-uk-notice-703">Goods exported from the UK (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 703)</a>.</p>

<h3>2.10 Dispatches or removals</h3>

<p>These are goods that you supply to customers in an EU member state that are dispatched or removed from Northern Ireland. Goods leaving Northern Ireland to go to an EU member state are not called ‘exports’, but are dispatches or removals.</p>

<h2>3. How to fill in each box on your return</h2>

<p>The requirements shown here apply to both paper and online returns.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#section4">section 4</a> if you’re using a special <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting scheme such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flat Rate Scheme for small businesses</li>
  <li>cash accounting</li>
  <li>annual accounting</li>
  <li>margin schemes for second hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors’ items</li>
  <li>payments on account</li>
  <li>reverse charge accounting</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use a retail scheme, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/retail-schemes-notice-727">Retail schemes (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 727)</a>.</p>

<h3>3.1 Common requirements when completing boxes 1 to 9</h3>

<p>When filling in each box on the return you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fill in all boxes clearly in black ink</li>
  <li>write ‘none’ where necessary on paper returns and ‘0.00’ on online returns</li>
  <li>not put a dash or leave any box blank</li>
  <li>write ‘00’ in the pence column if there are no pence</li>
  <li>not enter more than 1 amount in any box</li>
  <li>put the figure in brackets on a paper return, for example, (1000.00)  if you’ve a negative amount in boxes 1 to 4</li>
  <li>insert a minus sign before negative amounts on online returns, for example, -1000.00  if you’ve a negative amount in boxes 1 to 4</li>
</ul>

<p>The paper version of the return is designed to be read by machine. Follow these rules so that the information declared can be easily read.</p>

<h3>3.2 Filling in box 1</h3>

<h4>Box 1 <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due in the period on sales and other outputs</h4>

<p>Include the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due on all goods and services you supplied in the period covered by the return. This is your ‘output <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>’ for the period.</p>

<p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> may also be due on supplies outside the mainstream of your business. This does not include exports or dispatches as these are zero rated. Include the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due in this period on imports accounted for through postponed <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting.</p>

<p>Some examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fuel used for private motoring where <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is accounted for using a scale charge (read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-on-motoring-expenses-notice-70064">Motoring expenses (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700/64)</a>)</li>
  <li>the sale of stocks and assets</li>
  <li>goods you take out of the business for your own private use</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due under reverse charge accounting and the gold scheme (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para46">paragraph 4.6</a>)</li>
  <li>supplies to your staff</li>
  <li>gifts of goods that cost you more than £50, excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</li>
  <li>distance sales to Northern Ireland which are above the distance selling threshold or, if below the threshold the overseas supplier opts to register for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in the UK</li>
  <li>commission received for selling something on behalf of someone else</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> shown on self-billed invoices issued by your customer</li>
</ul>

<p>Points to remember when filling in box 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deduct any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on credit notes issued by you</li>
  <li>deduct any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> when you make refunds under the Retail Export Scheme</li>
  <li>include <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on the full value of the goods where you’ve taken something in part exchange</li>
  <li>leave out any amounts notified to you as assessments by us</li>
  <li>you can sometimes include <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> underdeclared or overdeclared on previous returns — but read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para66">paragraph 6.6</a>
</li>
  <li>you must not declare zero-rated exports or supplies to EU member states unless certain conditions are met (read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-on-goods-exported-from-the-uk-notice-703">Goods exported from the UK (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 703)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Filling in box 2</h3>

<h4>Box 2 <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due in the period on acquisitions of goods made in Northern Ireland from EU Member States</h4>

<p>From 1 January 2021 you will only be allowed to make acquisitions on goods you bring into Northern Ireland from the EU. For acquisitions you should show the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due on all goods and related costs bought from <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered suppliers in EU member states.</p>

<p>Related costs include any payment that you make to cover your supplier’s costs in making the supply, such as packing, transport or insurance which they’re responsible for under their contract with you.</p>

<p>You must include the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due on all your acquisitions for the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> period in which the tax point occurs. This is the earlier of either the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date your supplier issued you with the invoice</li>
  <li>15th day of the month following the one that the goods were sent to you in</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also be entitled to reclaim this amount as input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and do so by including the relevant figure within the total at box 4 (but read the rules for reclaiming input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> guide (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700)</a>).</p>

<h3>3.4 Filling in box 3</h3>

<h4>Box 3 total <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due</h4>

<p>Show the total <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due, that is, boxes 1 and 2 added together. This is your ‘output <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>’ for the period.</p>

<p>This figure will be calculated automatically if you’re completing your return online.</p>

<h3>3.5 Filling in box 4</h3>

<h4>Box 4 <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> reclaimed in the period on purchases and other inputs (including acquisitions from the EU)</h4>

<p>Show the total amount of deductible <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> charged on your business purchases. This is referred to as your ‘input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>’ for the period. Include the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> reclaimed in this period on imports accounted for through postponed <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting.</p>

<p>You cannot claim input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on your return unless you have a proper <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> invoice to support the claim (but read the rules in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> guide (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700)</a>.</p>

<p>You can reclaim <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have paid under the reverse charge procedure or the gold scheme (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para46">paragraph 4.6</a>)</li>
  <li>make acquisitions of goods into Northern Ireland from EU member states (this must correspond with the amount declared within box 2)</li>
  <li>pay on imports (as long as you’ve got the relevant import <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> certificate)</li>
  <li>are claiming back as bad debt relief, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/relief-from-vat-on-bad-debts-notice-70018">Relief from <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on bad debts (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700/18)</a>

  <li>pay on removals from a warehousing regime or a free zone</li>
  <li>have shown on self-billed invoices issued by you</li>

<h2>4. Filling in the return if you use a <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Accounting Scheme</h2>

<p>If you use any of the special <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting schemes there may be different rules for completing some of the boxes on the return (read the guidance at paragraphs <a class="govuk-link" href="#para41">4.1</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para42">4.2</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para43">4.3</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para44">4.4</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para45">4.5</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para46">4.6</a>). Other boxes should be completed in the normal way as shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">section 3</a>.</p>

<p>If you trade in other goods and services outside a special scheme you should also include those supplies on your return in the normal way.</p>

<h3>4.1 Flat Rate Scheme for small businesses</h3>

<p>This scheme allows small businesses an alternative to the normal method of accounting for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. Under this scheme you can work out your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> by applying a flat rate percentage to your total turnover (including <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you use this scheme there are special rules for completing boxes 1, 4, 6 and 7 of the return. All other boxes are completed as normal.</p>

<h4>Box 1 <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due on sales</h4>

<p>To calculate the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due under the Flat Rate Scheme, you must apply the flat rate percentage for your trade sector to the total of all your supplies, including <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>

<p>This includes your supplies which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at the standard rate</li>
  <li>at the reduced rate</li>
  <li>are zero-rated</li>
  <li>are exempt</li>
</ul>

<p>For <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return periods starting before 1 June 2022, you should include imports that are due in this period through postponed <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting in the total of your supplies.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return periods starting on or after 1 June 2022, you should not include imports that are due in this period through postponed <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> accounting within the total of your supplies. The value of import <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> should be added to the total <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due after you have applied the flat rate percentage for your trade sector.</p>

<p>You may have other output tax to include in the box, such as the sale of capital expenditure goods on which you’ve claimed input tax separately while using the Flat Rate Scheme.</p>

<p>You should also use this box to record transactions that are subject to the reverse charge (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para46">paragraph 4.6</a>).</p>

<h4>Box 4 total input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h4>

<p>If you use the Flat Rate Scheme you do not normally make a separate claim for input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, including any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on imports or acquisitions, as the flat rate percentage for your trade sector includes an allowance for input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>

<p>But you can recover <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on any single purchase of capital goods of £2,000 or more, including <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, and <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on stocks and assets on hand at registration. For details, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-733-flat-rate-scheme-for-small-businesses"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 733: Flat Rate Scheme for small businesses</a>.</p>

<p>You should also use this box to claim bad debt relief and to account for reverse charge transactions (read paragraph <a class="govuk-link" href="#para46">4.6</a>).</p>

<h4>Box 6 total value of sales</h4>

<p>Enter the turnover that you applied your flat rate percentage to, including <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. You should also include the value, excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, of any supplies accounted for outside the Flat Rate Scheme, such as the sale of any capital goods that you’ve reclaimed input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on, and reverse charge transactions. Also include any amount you’ve entered in box 8.</p>

<h4>Box 7 total value of purchases</h4>

<p>Usually there’ll be no figure in this box unless you’ve bought a capital good costing more than £2,000 (including <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) and you’re claiming the input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> in box 4. In which case, enter the sale price, excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>. Also include in box 7 any amount you’ve entered in box 9 and reverse charge transactions.</p>

<p>Further information about the scheme is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-733-flat-rate-scheme-for-small-businesses"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 733: Flat Rate Scheme for small businesses</a>.</p>

<h3>4.2 Cash Accounting Scheme</h3>

<p>This scheme allows you to account for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on the basis of payments you get and payments you make, rather than on invoices you issue and receive.</p>

<p>If you use this scheme there are special rules for completing boxes 1, 4, 6 and 7 of the return. All other boxes are completed as normal.</p>

<h4>Box 1 <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due on sales</h4>

<p>If you use the Cash Accounting Scheme, you must base the figure you put in this box on the payments you’ve had, not the invoices you’ve issued.</p>

<h4>Box 4 total input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>
</h4>

<p>If you use the Cash Accounting Scheme, you must base your input <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> claim on payments you’ve made, not invoices received. But you cannot use the scheme for acquisitions of goods from EU member states, or for imports. You must account for the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on such purchases in the normal way and add that amount to your cash accounting figure in this box.</p>

<h4>Box 6 total value of sales</h4>

<p>Enter the value of all your sales, excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, for the period based on the payments you’ve had, not the invoices issued. Also include in box 6 any amount you’ve entered in box 8.</p>

<h4>Box 7 total value of purchases</h4>

<p>Enter the value of all your purchases of goods and services for the period, excluding <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, based on the payments you’ve made, not the invoices received. Also include in box 7 any amount you’ve entered in box 9.</p>

<p>Further information about the scheme is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-cash-accounting-scheme-notice-731">Cash Accounting Scheme (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 731)</a>.</p>

<h3>4.3 Annual Accounting Scheme</h3>

<p>This allows you to complete one return each year and pay regular instalments of the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> you expect to owe to avoid a large bill at the end of the year.</p>

<p>If you use this scheme complete all boxes on the return in the normal way for the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> period.</p>

<h4>Box 5 Net <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> to pay to HMRC or to reclaim</h4>

<p>Do not deduct any instalments you’ve paid during the period when working out the figure to put into this box.</p>

<p>But the end of the year payment you send with your annual return should be the box 5 figure minus any instalments you’ve already made for the period.</p>

<p>Further information about the scheme is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-annual-accounting-notice-732">Annual accounting (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 732)</a>.</p>

<h3>4.4 Margin Scheme for second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors’ items</h3>

<p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is normally due on the full value of the goods you sell. If you trade in second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors’ items, you may be eligible to use the Margin Scheme. The Margin Scheme allows you to calculate <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on the difference (or margin) between your buying price and your selling price. If no profit is made (because the buying price exceeds the selling price) then no <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is payable.</p>

<p>If you use the Margin Scheme there are special rules for completing boxes 1, 6, and 7 on the return. If you also trade in goods and services outside the Margin Scheme you must account for those supplies on your return in the normal way (described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">section 3</a>).</p>

<h4>Box 1 <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due on sales</h4>

<p>Include the output <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due on all eligible goods sold in the period covered by the return.</p>

<h4>Box 6 total value of sales</h4>

<p>Include the full selling price of all eligible goods sold in the period, less any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due on the margin.</p>

<h4>Box 7 total value of purchases</h4>

<p>Include the full purchase price of eligible goods bought in the period.</p>

<p>You do not need to include Margin Scheme purchases or sales in boxes 8 and 9 of your return.</p>

</ul>

<h3>4.5 Payments on account</h3>

<p>Every <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered business with an annual <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> liability of more than £2.3 million should make payments on account (<abbr title="payments on account">POA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Once in <abbr title="payments on account">POA</abbr> each business must make interim payments at the end of the second and third months of each <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> quarter. These interim payments are <abbr title="payments on account">POA</abbr> of the quarterly <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> liability. A balancing payment for the quarter, that is the quarterly liability less the <abbr title="payments on account">POA</abbr> already made, is then made with the return.</p>

<p>When you complete your return you should fill in and send your quarterly returns in the normal way. Do not adjust any figures on the return to take account of <abbr title="payments on account">POA</abbr> that you’ve made. But the amount to pay is the net liability shown on the return less any <abbr title="payments on account">POA</abbr> that you’ve already made in respect of that period.</p>

<p>Repayments that may be due will be made under the normal rules. If your return is a repayment return, the payments on account made in the quarter will also be repaid subject to any debt on file.</p>

<p>Further information is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70060-payments-on-account"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700/60: payments on account</a>.</p>

<h3>4.6 Reverse charge accounting</h3>

<p>Under the reverse charge procedure, the buyer of the goods or services, rather than the seller, is liable to account for the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> on the sale. The return should be completed in accordance with the guidance in the following table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">If you use the reverse charge for</th>
      <th scope="col">and you’re the supplier, fill in</th>
      <th scope="col">and you’re the customer, fill in</th>

<h2>5. Submitting your return and making payment</h2>

<p>You (or your accountant or other agent) can opt to use either the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-returns-and-ec-sales-list-commercial-software-suppliers/vat-commercial-software-suppliers">free HMRC <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> online service</a> or commercial software.</p>

<p>You can benefit from the built-in safeguards which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an on screen acknowledgement</li>
  <li>automatic calculations to reduce errors</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also be able to make payment by Direct Debit and you may get extra time to submit your return and make payment.</p>

<p>If you’re sending an online return, you can check your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Return and payment deadlines in your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/send-vat-return"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> online account</a>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> online account tells you when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Returns are due</li>
  <li>the payment must clear HMRC’s account</li>
</ul>

<p>The deadline for submitting the return online and paying HMRC are usually the same — 1 calendar month and 7 days after the end of an accounting period.</p>

<p>You need to allow time for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-vat/bank-details">payment</a> to reach HMRC’s account.</p>

<p>If you’re sending us a paper return, it must reach us no later than the due date shown on your return.</p>

<p>Your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-vat">payment</a> should also reach us in time to clear our bank accounts by the same due date.</p>

<p>If you’re using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-annual-accounting-scheme"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Annual Accounting Scheme</a>, your due date is 2 months after the end of the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> period.</p>

<p>Your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-vat">payment</a> should also reach us in time to clear our bank accounts by the same due date.</p>

<h2>6. Returns, payments and assessments</h2>

<h3>6.1 If you cannot complete your return or pay the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> by the due date</h3>

<p>If you do not have all the information you need to complete your return or you’ll be unable to submit a correct return or payment by the due date, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700#section21"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> guide (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700), paragraph 21.2 Late, incomplete or incorrect returns and payments</a>.</p>

<p>For details about default surcharge and how it works, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-default-surcharge-notice-70050">Default surcharge (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700/50)</a>.</p>

<h3>6.2 If you submit your return and payment late</h3>

<p>We’ll tell you if we get your return or payment late and you may be liable to a surcharge. It’s in your own interests to make sure we get your returns and payments on time.</p>

<p>You can find out more about this in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-default-surcharge-notice-70050">Default surcharge (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700/50)</a>.</p>

<p>For further information on how to make a payment, go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-vat">Pay your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> bill</a>.</p>

<h3>6.3 If you lose your paper return</h3>

<p>If you’ve lost or mislaid the original form do not alter another return form or send your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> declaration in another way. You should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> helpline</a> immediately and ask for a replacement, but we cannot provide paper versions of any returns that you’re required to submit online.</p>

<h3>6.4 If you are unable to send an electronic return due to a system problem</h3>

<p>If the system crashes or the website is not available, you should phone the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-online-services-helpdesk"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Online Services helpdesk</a>. They’ll tell you what you should do. In the meantime you should still make arrangements to pay any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due electronically and on time.</p>

<h3>6.5 If you get an assessment from HMRC because you have failed to send in a return</h3>

<p>You should send us the return immediately, with the correct figures for the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> period. If you get such an assessment and it understates your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> liability and you do not tell us within 30 days, you may be liable to a penalty and interest.</p>

<p>When making payments if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not paid the assessment and box 5 of the return shows that you owe us <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, then you should pay the full amount shown as due, not the amount on the assessment</li>
  <li>already paid the assessment and the amount shown in box 5 is more than the assessment, then you should send us a payment for the balance with the return</li>
  <li>paid the assessment and the amount shown in box 5 is less than the assessment, then we’ll repay or credit you with the overpayment subject to any enquiries we may need to make</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.6 How to correct errors on previous returns</h3>

<p>You may be able to correct errors in returns for the preceding 4 years by using boxes 1 and 4 of the return for the period of discovery provided the net error is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£10,000 or less</li>
  <li>between £10,000 and £50,000 and does not exceed 1% of the total value of your sales (before correction) shown in box 6</li>
</ul>

<p>Net errors exceeding £50,000 and those above £10,000 that exceed 1% of the box 6 amount must be separately notified.</p>

<p>Further information is contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70045-how-to-correct-vat-errors-and-make-adjustments-or-claims"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 700/45: how to correct <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> errors and make adjustments or claims</a>.</p>

<h3>6.7 How to tell us about changes to your business</h3>

<ul>
  <li>online — for information on how to do this read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration/changes-to-your-details">Changes to your details</a>

<h2>7. Things to check before you send your return</h2>

<h3>7.1 Checking your figures</h3>

<p>When checking your figures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if all your outputs are standard-rated, the total in box 1 should be 20% of the total in box 6 (before 4 January 2011 the standard <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> rate was 17.5%, and from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009 it was 15%)</li>
  <li>if you have entered a value in box 9, include any acquisition tax due on your UK or intra-EU acquisitions in boxes 2 and 4</li>
  <li>your box 5 total should be the difference between boxes 3 and 4 — this is calculated automatically if you complete your return online</li>
  <li>if the total in box 8 is more than the total in box 6, or the total in box 9 is more than the total in box 7, you may have transposed the box figures in error</li>
  <li>when you complete your online return, check that you have entered the correct figures before you click on ‘submit’, as you cannot amend the return online after your have submitted it</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.2 Other checks</h3>

<p>Other checks to be carried out are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have you completed every box on the return, entering ‘none’ on paper returns and ‘0.00’ on electronic returns if applicable?</li>
  <li>have you entered any negative figures on a paper return in brackets, for example, (1000.00)? insert a minus sign before negative amounts on the online return for example -1000.00</li>
  <li>have you zero-rated any exports or removals without obtaining valid evidence that the goods have left the UK within the appropriate time limits? Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-on-goods-exported-from-the-uk-notice-703">Goods exported from the UK (<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Notice 703)</a>
</li>
  <li>have you included any errors you may have found on previous returns? (Read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para66">paragraph 6.6</a>)</li>
  <li>have you made the necessary adjustments in boxes 1 and 4 for credit notes received and issued by you?</li>
  <li>have you signed and dated the paper return?</li>
  <li>if you’re sending a cheque, have you signed and dated it correctly, do the words and figures agree and is it made out to HMRC followed by your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registration number?</li>
  <li>do not staple the cheque to the return</li>
  <li>if you’re paying by cheque have you enclosed the cheque?</li>
  <li>if you’re sending a cheque, you must allow enough time for the cheque to clear to our bank account by the due date shown on your paper return</li>
  <li>make sure you have not included any correspondence with your return, correspondence must be sent separately to the appropriate office to make sure it is dealt with promptly, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> helpline</a> for help on where to send other correspondence</li>
  <li>have you made arrangements with your bank to make any electronic payment, ensuring cleared funds are in our <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> account by the appropriate date?</li>
  <li>have you provided your bank with our <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> account details? (they are: sort code: 08 32 00, account number: 11963155, account name: HMRC <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>have you provided your bank with your <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered name and <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> registration number as the pay reference, without any gap in the 9 digits, for example 123456789?</li>
  <li>have you notified the Grimsby National Registration Service of any changes in business circumstances (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para67">paragraph 6.7</a>)?</li>
</ul>
