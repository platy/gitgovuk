<p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) encourages driving instructors to carry out mock driving tests for their pupils. This can help your pupils understand how:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the driving test works</li>
  <li>faults are assessed</li>
  <li>any mistakes they make would affect their test result</li>
</ul>

<p>It can also help them to learn to deal with nerves when driving in a different environment.</p>

<h2>When to use mock tests</h2>

<p>Use mock tests with your pupil when they can consistently drive safely without any prompting.</p>

<p>You can choose to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry out the mock test yourself, playing the role of the driving examiner</li>
  <li>arrange for another driving instructor to carry out the mock test with your pupil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Arranging another driving instructor to carry out the mock test</h3>

<p>If you think that your pupil will be particularly nervous driving with a stranger, it can help if you ask another driving instructor to do the mock test.</p>

<p>To avoid influencing their assessment, do not share your pupil’s strengths and weaknesses with the other instructor before they carry out the mock test.</p>

<p>This will give your pupil experience of dealing with their nerves before their driving test.</p>

<h2>What your mock test should include</h2>

<p>The mock test should take about 40 minutes and include everything covered during a normal driving test. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>checking your pupil’s driving licence</li>
  <li>an eyesight check</li>
  <li>‘show me, tell me’ vehicle safety questions</li>
  <li>general driving ability</li>
  <li>reversing the car</li>
  <li>independent driving</li>
  <li>emergency stop</li>
  <li>giving the test result and feedback</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The emergency stop may not be included in your pupil’s actual driving test - it’s used in 1 in 3 tests.</p>
</div>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rules-for-observing-driving-tests">sit in on one of your pupils driving tests</a> to see how they’re carried out. You need to check with your pupil beforehand if they want you to do this during their test. Sitting in on a test can help you understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when you should give instructions and directions</li>
  <li>what you should say</li>
  <li>how to give feedback at the end of the test</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design mock driving test routes</h2>

<p>You can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create your own test routes that you’ll use for mock driving tests</li>
  <li>check if your local driving instructor association has developed any mock test routes you can use</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>DVSA does not publish the routes that are used for real driving tests. Avoid using roads you know are used for driving tests to help avoid causing distractions to people taking a real driving test.</p>
</div>

<p>The route should take about 30 minutes to drive.</p>

<h3>What mock test routes should include</h3>

<p>Your route should start in a suitable place to check your pupils eyesight and carry out a ‘tell me’ safety question.</p>

<h4>Types of roads to include</h4>

<p>Mock test routes should include as many of these as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rural roads with higher speed limits</li>
  <li>urban roads</li>
  <li>dual carriageways, including those with the national speed limit</li>
  <li>multi-lane roundabouts</li>
  <li>one-way systems</li>
</ul>

<h4>Driving abilities your pupil will need to demonstrate</h4>

<p>When you plan the route, make sure it includes opportunities for your pupil to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change lanes</li>
  <li>pass parked or stationary vehicles and obstacles</li>
  <li>approach and cross junctions</li>
  <li>observe road markings, signs and react appropriately to potential or actual risks</li>
</ul>

<p>Each route you create should be as consistent as possible, with similar hazards on each route.</p>

<h3>Plan where you’ll do the manoeuvres</h3>

<p>Depending on which manoeuvre you ask the pupil to do on the route, it will need to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a straight section of a main road, with clear visibility ahead and behind where you can pull up on the right and reverse</li>
  <li>a straight section of a main road with cars parked on left, with clear visibility ahead and behind where you can parallel park</li>
  <li>a car park suitable for parking in a bay (either driving into a bay and reversing out, or reversing in and driving out)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Choose suitable car parks</h4>

<p>When you choose car parks to use, make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there are no restrictions stopping you from practising in it</li>
  <li>it can be driven around and exited if no bays are available</li>
  <li>there are several bays to choose from</li>
  <li>bays require the pupil to steer into them on the left or right</li>
  <li>bays are clearly defined</li>
  <li>you use a quieter area of the car park</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plan the independent driving section of the route</h3>

<p>You need to ask your pupil to drive independently for 20 minutes of the mock test. This can be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>following directions from a sat nav</li>
  <li>following traffic signs</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>1 out of 5 real driving tests ask candidates to follow traffic signs, so you should make sure you have mock test routes which also use traffic signs.</p>
</div>

<h4>Set up a sat nav to give directions</h4>

<p>You can set up your sat nav to give directions by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating, saving and using set routes, if your device has that feature</li>
  <li>setting a destination to drive to - however, be aware the device might not always suggest the exact route you want to use</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> examiners use a TomTom Start 52 sat nav for the driving test, as it can save custom routes. However, you do not need to use the same make and model for mock tests.</p>

<p>Check your device’s user guide to find out the best way to safely use it to give directions.</p>

<h2>Carry out the mock test</h2>

<p>You should make the mock test experience as realistic as possible by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoiding giving any instruction during the test</li>
  <li>using the wording included in this guidance (under ‘What you should say’)</li>
  <li>saving feedback on any faults until the test has finished</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If your pupil’s driving becomes dangerous during the mock test, you should stop it early and explain why you have decided to stop the test.</p>
</div>

<h3>Start the mock test and check your pupil’s driving licence</h3>

<p>Explain to your pupil that you will be starting the mock test and you’ll be playing the role of the driving examiner from that point on.</p>

<p>Make sure they understand you will be roleplaying a driving examiner until you tell them otherwise.</p>

<p>Start by checking that the pupil has a valid UK driving licence.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good morning/afternoon may I see your driving licence</p>

  <p>Can you confirm your name is correct?</p>

  <p>The test will last about 38 to 40 minutes and will include about 20 minutes of independent driving and various roads and traffic conditions.</p>

  <p>I will ask you to complete one manoeuvre and we may carry out an emergency stop. The sort of things you have been practising with your instructor and accompanying driver.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Which car are you using?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h3>Check your pupil’s eyesight</h3>

<p>Ask your pupil to read a number plate on a parked vehicle which is at least 20m away - this is around 4 car lengths.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If they need to wear glasses to read a number plate, they must also wear them whenever they are driving.</p>
</div>

<p>If your pupil has dyslexia, they’re allowed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read a rear number plate instead of a front number plate (the black text on a yellow background can be easier for them to read)</li>
  <li>read back to front or in a non-uniform order</li>
  <li>misread certain numbers and letters that are similar shapes such as B and 8, D and O, 5 and S</li>
  <li>write down the letters and numbers rather than reading them out</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Will you read the number plate of [description and colour of] car [where it’s parked, for example near the tree]</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h3>Ask a ‘tell me’ vehicle safety check question</h3>

<p>Before getting in the car ask your pupil one ‘tell me’ vehicle safety check question.</p>

<p>Choose a question from the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="#print-the-documents">‘tell me’ questions</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure it’s appropriate for the weather conditions - for example, do not ask them to open the bonnet in high winds or heavy rain.</p>

<p>Your pupil is allowed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>refer to a vehicle information system (if fitted) when answering questions, for example, a tyre pressure monitoring system</li>
  <li>explain how they’d do a practical check if they have a disability which means they cannot physically do it</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Make sure your pupil does not touch a hot engine or physically check the fluid levels when answering the question.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now I should like to ask you one question about your vehicle and other matters relating to vehicle safety.</p>

  <p>[Ask the first question].</p>

  <p class="last-child">The second question will be a ‘show me’ question on the move. If you would like to make yourself comfortable in your car now please, I will join you in a moment.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h3>Start the car and move off</h3>

<p>Join your pupil in the car, explain how your instructions will work, and ask them to move off.</p>

<p>Watch them to make sure the handbrake is applied and the car is in neutral gear before they start the engine.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throughout the drive continue ahead, unless traffic signs direct you otherwise. When I want you to turn left or right, I will tell you in plenty of time.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Move off when you are ready, please.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h3>Give directions and instructions to your pupil</h3>

<p>Give clear directions and instructions to your pupil in good time, especially where signs and markings show an option of lanes.</p>

<p>At complex junctions, roundabouts and gyratory systems, you might need to use extra wording to make the direction and route clear. The ‘What you should say’ section gives examples.</p>

<p>If your pupil has dyslexia or dyspraxia, you can make adjustments such as confirming directions by pointing or using hand signals.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drive on when you are ready, please.</p>

  <p>Take the next road on the left/right, please.</p>

  <p>Will you take the second road on the left/right, please. (If necessary, add this is the first.)</p>

  <p>At the end of the road turn left/right, please.</p>

  <p>At the roundabout turn left please.</p>

  <p>At the roundabout turn left please - it’s the first exit.</p>

  <p>At the roundabout follow the road ahead.</p>

  <p>At the roundabout follow the road ahead - it’s the second exit.</p>

  <p>At the roundabout turn right please.</p>

  <p class="last-child">At the roundabout turn right please - it’s the third exit.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h3>Ask a ‘show me’ vehicle safety check question</h3>

<p>While your pupil is driving you’ll need to ask them one ‘show me’ vehicle safety check question when it’s safe to do so.</p>

<p>You can ask them at any point during the test including the independent drive.</p>

<p>Choose a question from the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="#print-the-documents">‘show me’ questions</a>.</p>

<h3>General driving</h3>

<h4>Stopping normally and moving off</h4>

<p>You should ask the pupil to make at least 2 normal stops during the test. This can include when pulling up to start the independent driving section, as long as the road conditions allow.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, you should test the pupil’s ability to move off on a reasonably steep uphill gradient.</p>

<p>If stopping on a hill is not possible you should include another designated stop.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The test must always include moving off at an angle from behind a stationary vehicle</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pull up on the left at a safe place, please.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Drive on when you’re ready</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h3>Carrying out a reverse manouevre</h3>

<p>Ask your pupil to do one of the following exercises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>parallel park at the side of the road</li>
  <li>park in a parking bay (reverse in and drive out)</li>
  <li>park in a parking bay (drive in and reverse out)</li>
  <li>pull up on the right-hand side of the road, reverse for around 2 car lengths, and rejoin the traffic</li>
</ul>

<p>You can ask them to do this at any point during the test including the independent drive.</p>

<h4>Parallel park at the side of the road</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you pull up on the left well before you get to the next parked car, please.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This is the reverse parking exercise. Would you drive forward and stop alongside the car ahead. Then reverse in and park reasonably close to and parallel with the kerb. Try to complete the exercise within about 2 car lengths.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h4>Park in a parking bay (reverse in and drive out)</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I should like you to reverse park in the car park. Drive forward into the car park, then reverse into a convenient parking bay. Finish within one of the bays.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h4>Park in a parking bay (drive in and reverse out)</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like you to drive forward into a convenient parking bay finishing within the lines, either to the left or the right (if car park allows).</p>

  <p class="last-child">Now I would like to reverse out either to the left or the right. [Direct your pupil if arrows indicate a one-way system in the car park].</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h4>Pull up on the right and reverse</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pull up on the right when it is safe to do so, please.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I would now like you to reverse for about 2 car lengths, keeping reasonably close to the kerb.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h3>Independent driving</h3>

<p>Your pupil will have to drive for about 20 minutes by following either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>directions from a sat nav</li>
  <li>traffic signs</li>
</ul>

<p>You should set up the sat nav for them.</p>

<h4>Following sat nav directions</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now I would like you to drive independently following the directions from the sat nav until I tell you otherwise.</p>

  <p>Drive on when you are ready.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Thank you, that’s the end of the independent driving. I will direct you from now on.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h4>Following traffic signs</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pull up on the left please (either specify location or use normal stop wordings).</p>

  <p>Now I would like you to drive independently following the traffic signs for ……., continue to follow the signs until I tell you otherwise. Drive on when you are ready.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Thank you, that’s the end of the independent driving. I will direct you from now on.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h4>Going off the route</h4>

<p>Do not give the pupil a fault if they take a wrong turning safely.</p>

<p>Help them to get back on the route by offering directions.</p>

<h3>Carry out an emergency stop</h3>

<p>An emergency stop must be carried out safely where road and traffic conditions are suitable. Do not do it on a busy road or anywhere that could cause danger to other traffic.</p>

<p>If you cannot find an appropriate opportunity to do the emergency stop, ask the pupil to pull up. Choose the right moment as they will have been expecting the emergency stop signal and may react accordingly. Advise them that the exercise will be given later and that they will be warned again beforehand.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pull up on the left at a safe place, please [or] Pull up along here, just before………..please.</p>

  <p>Shortly I shall ask you to carry out an emergency stop. When I give this signal, [raise your right hand to face level and say] ‘Stop’, I’d like you to stop as quickly and as safely as possible. Before giving the signal I shall look round to make sure it is safe, but please wait for my signal before doing the exercise.</p>

  <p>Do you understand the instructions?</p>

  <p class="last-child">Thank you. I will not ask you to do that exercise again. Drive on when you are ready.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<h3>Ending the test</h3>

<p>When the mock test is complete, ask the pupil to pull over in a safe place and <a class="govuk-link" href="#giving-feedback">give your pupil feedback</a> about how they’ve done.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What you should say</h4>

<blockquote>

<h2>Assess and record faults your pupil makes</h2>

<h3>Driving, serious and dangerous faults</h3>

<p>There are 3 types of fault:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a driving fault - this is not potentially dangerous, but if the pupil keeps making the same fault, it could become a serious fault</li>
  <li>a serious fault - something potentially dangerous</li>
  <li>a dangerous fault - this involves actual danger to the driver, the examiner, the public or property</li>
</ul>

<p>When deciding what level of fault to mark you should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to what extent did the pupil not meet the required standard</li>
  <li>was safety or control compromised</li>
  <li>was a legal requirement breached</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use the marking sheet</h3>

<p>The marking sheet is split into assessment criteria under these headings:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#eco-marking">eco (fuel-efficient driving)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to mark faults under the right assessment criteria. To do this, ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what the fault was</li>
  <li>how it happened</li>
  <li>what caused it</li>
</ul>

<p>Use a tally on the left-hand side of the box to mark any driving faults made against each assessment criteria.</p>

<p>Put a slash through the ‘S’ or ‘D’ circles if your pupil makes a serious or dangerous fault.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="How to record faults on the marking sheet" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151017/marking-sheet.png"></div></figure>

<h3>When to mark the fault</h3>

<p>Observe faults as they’re made and evaluate them as soon as you can make a confident judgement. Do not be too hasty when you make a decision - wait until the event has finished, then mark the fault when it’s safe to do so.</p>

<p>Do not double-mark faults. This means you should not record the same fault under more than one box on the form.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You can mark both control and observation when assessing and marking a manoeuvre - this is not classed as double-marking.</p>
</div>

<h3>Eyesight test</h3>

<p>The pupil should be able to read a number plate, in good daylight, (with the aid of glasses or contact lenses if worn) from a distance of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 metres for vehicles with a new-style number plate</li>
  <li>20.5 metres for vehicles with an old-style number plate</li>
</ul>

<p>Record a serious fault if the pupil cannot do this.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#assessment-criteria">Go back to the list of assessment criteria</a>.</p>

<h3>Manoeuvres</h3>

<p>When you ask the pupil to do a manoeuvre, you need to record any faults made related to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>control</li>
  <li>observation</li>
</ul>

<p>The manoeuvres are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#reverse-right-marking">pull up on the right and reverse (shown on the form as reverse/right)</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#reverse-park-marking">reversing into a parking space</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#reverse-road-marking">reverse park at the side of the road (parallel park)</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#forward-park-marking">forward park into a parking space</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Reverse/right (pull up on the right and reverse)</h4>

<p>The pupil should demonstrate the ability to safely pull up on the right hand side of the road and reverse 2 car lengths. They should make effective all round observation throughout the manoeuvre showing consideration to other road users.</p>

<p>Reasons to record a fault under ‘control’ include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>poor co-ordination of controls</li>
  <li>scrubbing or brushing the kerb</li>
  <li>mounting the pavement</li>
  <li>stalling</li>
  <li>reversing out into the road</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ancillary controls</h4>

<p>The pupil should understand the function of all the controls and switches, especially those that have a bearing on road safety. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>indicators</li>
  <li>lights</li>
  <li>windscreen wipers</li>
  <li>demisters</li>
  <li>heaters</li>
</ul>

<p>The pupil should be able to find these controls and operate them correctly, when necessary, without looking down or causing a loss of control.</p>

<p>Reasons to record a fault include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>failing to use ancillary controls when necessary</li>
  <li>being unable to operate the controls</li>
  <li>being unable to locate or operate essential ancillary controls</li>
  <li>losing control whilst operating ancillary controls</li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#meeting-marking">meeting</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#crossing-marking">crossing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The pupil should only overtake when it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>A sufficient safety margin should be left when other vehicles are being overtaken. Cyclists and motorcyclists need as much space as other vehicles; they can wobble or swerve suddenly.</p>

<p>They should not cut in too quickly after overtaking.</p>

<p>Care should be taken when the width of the road is restricted or when the road narrows. If there is an obstruction on their side or not enough room for two vehicles to pass safely, the car should be prepared to wait and let the approaching vehicles through.</p>

<p>When turning right, other vehicles should not have to stop, slow down or swerve to allow the car to complete its turn.</p>

<h4>Overtaking</h4>

<h4>Pedestrian crossings</h4>

<p>Reasons to record a fault under ‘pedestrian crossings’ include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>approaching too fast</li>
  <li>not reacting to the lights at a pedestrian controlled crossing</li>
  <li>pulling away well before the crossing is clear of pedestrians</li>
  <li>not stopping when necessary</li>
  <li>beckoning pedestrians to cross</li>

<h4>Awareness / planning</h4>

<p>Reasons to record a fault under ‘awareness / planning’ include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not considering the actions of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders</li>
  <li>not anticipating road and traffic conditions in good time</li>
  <li>reacting to other road users at the last moment rather than in good time</li>

<h4>Clearance</h4>

<p>The pupil should allow plenty of room when passing stationary vehicles and obstructions. They should be able to display the readiness to be prepared to slow down or stop, as a door may open, a child may run out or a vehicle may pull out without warning.</p>

<p>Record a fault under ‘clearance’ if the pupil drives too close to stationary vehicles and obstructions.</p>

<h4>Following distance</h4>

<p>The car must always be a safe distance between the pupil and other vehicles.</p>

<p>On wet or slippery roads it takes much longer to stop.</p>

<p>When the car has stopped in traffic queues, sufficient space should be left to pull out if the vehicle in front has problems.</p>

<p>Reasons to record a fault under ‘following distance’ include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>getting too close to moving vehicles</li>
  <li>pulling up too close to vehicle ahead</li>
</ul>

<h4>Use of speed</h4>

<p>The pupil should position their car correctly for the intended route.</p>

<p>Where lanes are marked, the car should be positioned to the middle of the lane.</p>

<p>They should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid straddling lane markings</li>
  <li>not change lanes unnecessarily.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reasons to record a fault under ‘use of speed’ include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>driving too fast for prevailing road traffic and weather conditions</li>
  <li>breaking the speed limit</li>
</ul>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#undue-hesitation-marking">undue hesitation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The pupil should drive at a safe and appropriate speed for the prevailing road and traffic conditions. Speed limits are not target speeds and there will be occasions where pupils 
need to reduce their speed to deal safely with situations such as narrow residential streets or busy high streets - this should not be considered as a fault.</p>

<h4>Appropriate speed</h4>

<h3>Examiner took action (ETA)</h3>

<p>Record a fault under ‘ETA’ if at any point your pupil’s driving becomes dangerous and you have to take action to correct it. This action may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical</li>
  <li>verbal</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#assessment-criteria">Go back to the list of assessment criteria</a>.</p>

<h3>Eco (fuel-efficient driving)</h3>

<p>On the form you can record any faults made related to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#appropriate-speed-marking">control</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#undue-hesitation-marking">planning</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The pupil should drive in an eco friendly manner to reduce pollution and save fuel. They should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plan well ahead and choose appropriate gears</li>
  <li>avoid heavy braking and over revving of the engine, particularly when stopped or moving off</li>
  <li>consider stopping the engine when stopped for long periods of time</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Although eco-safe driving is assessed during the driving test, it does not affect the overall result. You use this when you give feedback at the end of the test.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#assessment-criteria">Go back to the list of assessment criteria</a>.</p>

<h2>Give feedback at the end of the test</h2>

<p>The pupil will pass the test if they make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no more than 15 driving faults (sometimes called ‘minors’)</li>
  <li>no serious or dangerous faults (sometimes called ‘majors’)</li>
</ul>

<p>When giving the feedback at the end of the test, you could either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give the feedback as though you’re the examiner</li>
  <li>ask their pupil how they think they did</li>
</ul>

<h3>Giving feedback as though you’re the examiner</h3>

<p>You could give the result and feedback while still roleplaying as the examiner. This will give the pupil a feel for how much feedback the examiner will give.</p>

<p>Offer the pupil a brief explanation of the faults that you have recorded on the marking sheet. Explain all serious and dangerous faults, and a selection of repeated driving faults.</p>

<p>If the pupil fails the test due to making 15 or more driving faults, you’ll need to explain all of the faults.</p>

<h3>End the mock test and give feedback</h3>

<p>When the mock test is finished, you can stop roleplaying as the examiner and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give more feedback about their driving during the mock test</li>
  <li>ask coaching questions about any faults</li>
  <li>answer any questions they have about the test and how they drove</li>
  <li>use the results of the mock test to plan their future lessons</li>
</ul>
