<p>Sometimes HMRC uses more than one way to get in touch. For example, we may contact you by letter first before following up with an email, call or text message. This is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it can provide an extra level of security</li>
  <li>it can help prepare customers for the follow up contact</li>
  <li>these are the contact details HMRC has for you</li>
</ul>

<p>All the HMRC contacts listed on this page can use more than one communication method. They are in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>The email will have the title â€˜<abbr title="Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings">ATED</abbr> Returnâ€™.</p>

<p>The email or letter will never ask for any personal or financial information.</p>

<h2>Effects of the super-deduction</h2>

<div class="example">
<p>From 17 January 2022 up to and including 11 April 2022, we will contact you by email or letter.</p>
</div>

<p>HMRC will work with the independent agency Ipsos MORI to carry out research. This research will explore the effects of the super-deduction and help to inform future policy.</p>

<p>You may receive an email or letter from Ipsos MORI and HMRC to tell you about the research and invite you to take part.</p>

<p>Taking part is voluntary and if you do take part, all responses will be confidential. Any information given will be used for research purposes only.</p>

<p>If you need further information, contact details for both Ipsos MORI and HMRC will be on the letter or email.</p>

<h2>HMRC text numbers</h2>

<p>HMRC is using a new number to send text messages to customers. This may be different to one you have received a text from in the past.</p>

<h2>Logging into your HMRC tax account with multi-factor authentication</h2>

<div class="example">
<p>We will contact you by text message or automated voice call.</p>
</div>

<p>Multi-factor authentication is an extra security feature for customers which replaces 2-step verification. It helps prevent someone else from accessing a customerâ€™s digital account, even if they know the user ID and password. HMRC will send an access code by text message or voice call to your chosen mobile phone or landline number to activate the multi-factor authorisation. You will need this code to complete the access.</p>

<p>These text messages and voice calls will never ask you to give personal or financial information.</p>

<p>If you have activated multi-factor authentication youâ€™ll only be able to access the account using the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Government Gateway user ID and password</li>
  <li>mobile or landline device which you have registered</li>
</ul>

<h2>National Minimum Wage and employment</h2>
