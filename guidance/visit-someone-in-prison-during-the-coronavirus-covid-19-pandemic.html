<h2>Prison visits in England &amp; Wales</h2>

<p>Prisons in England and Wales have resumed social visits when safe to do so. This decision is made by HM Prison &amp; Probation Service (HMPPS) in partnership with health partners.</p>

<p>The below restrictions apply because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This means that it’s important to check local guidance regularly as the situation in individual prisons may change. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/prisons-in-england-and-wales">Find out which prisons have social visits</a></p>

<p>If you are unable to visit someone in prison you can still keep in touch. Find out about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-and-prisons#contact">other ways of keeping in touch</a>.</p>

<h2>When not to visit a prison</h2>
<p>You must not visit anyone in a prison if you are self-isolating and you should not if you have symptoms of COVID-19. If you have <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">symptoms of COVID-19</a> - a new continuous cough, a high temperature, a loss or change to your normal sense of taste or smell - even if your symptoms are mild, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">stay at home</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a PCR test</a>.</p>

<p>If notified by NHS Test and Trace service (England) or Test, Trace, Protect service (Wales), you must self-isolate for 10 days or for any shorter period advised by them. This includes for example if you have tested positive whilst not experiencing symptoms.</p>

<p>If you are fully vaccinated and have had close contact with someone with COVID-19 you are strongly advised to take a lateral flow device test (LFD) every day for 7 days or until 10 days since your last contact with the person who tested positive for COVID-19 if this is earlier. Prisons are deemed high risk environments so it is not recommended that you visit a prison during the 7 day period.</p>

<p>For information about whether you might need to self-isolate and how you can protect others if:</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">you live with someone who has or might have COVID-19</a></li>

</ul>

<p>If you get any COVID-19 symptoms, self-isolate immediately and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">get a PCR test</a>.

<h2>Who can visit an adult prison</h2>

<p>To visit someone in an adult prison, you must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aged 18 or over, or under 18 accompanied by an eligible adult (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#groups">Visiting an adult prison, YOI or STC in a group</a>)</li>
  <li>a partner, parent, sibling, child, foster-parent, grandparent, carer or significant other of the person you are visiting, or an individual on whom the person in prison relies for emotional support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who can visit a young offender institute (YOI) or secure training centre (STC)</h2>

<p>To visit someone in a YOI or STC, you must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aged 18 or over, or under 18 accompanied by an eligible adult (see Visiting an adult prison, YOI or STC in a group)</li>
  <li>a partner, parent, sibling, child, foster-parent, grandparent, carer or significant other of the person you are visiting, an individual on whom the person in YOI or STC relies on for emotional support, or a social worker for looked after children (LAC)</li>
  <li>an adult, though not the parent, who is part of the same household as the parent of the dependent child. 
To note, siblings who are classed as LAC may need a social worker to attend with them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visiting an adult prison, YOI or STC in a group</h2>
<p>The following rules apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 adult can visit a prisoner with up to 1 other adult</li>
  <li>if you’re the only adult visiting, you can bring up to 2 children</li>
  <li>if you’re visiting with another adult, you can only bring 1 child</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visiting rules</h2>

<p>During your visit you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow all prison COVID-secure guidelines and measures to ensure your, the prisoners’ and staff safety, following advice from prison staff as necessary</li>
  <li>wear a face covering</li>
  <li>remove face coverings if staff need to carry out security checks</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot bring any refreshments to a prison, except if you are bringing food or milk for a baby. You can ask staff for water. Play facilities will not be available at any prison.</p>

<h2>Children under 11</h2>

<p>Children under 11 are allowed contact if it is in line with the prison’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visit-someone-in-prison-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic#visiting-rules" class="govuk-link">normal rules</a>.</p>

<h2>Testing at social visits</h2>

<p>Visitors aged 12 and over need to take a lateral flow device test (LFD) before coming for their visit. If your test is negative, you and your visitors will be able to have physical contact during your visit, but you will all need to wear a face covering.</p>

<p>Individual prisons may have to alter the way they operate visits – sometimes at short notice to keep everyone as safe as possible. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/prisons-in-england-and-wales">Check with the prison first</a></p>

<h3>Taking the test</h3>

<p>You should take a rapid lateral flow device (LFD) test at home on the day of the visit. More information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests">how to order LFD tests and report your results</a>.</p>

<p>After taking a home test you must register your test and the result. Once you have done this you will get a text or email confirming your registration of your result. A copy of this email/text showing a negative result is required to be shown to the visits staff as evidence.</p>

<p>You can also bring a test with you to take at the prison, but it is best to test before you leave home in case it is a positive result.</p>

<p>If you cannot take a test for medical reasons, you will need to provide written evidence explaining why this is. </p>

<p>Some prisons may be able to offer testing on site. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/prisons-in-england-and-wales">Check with the prison first</a>.</p>

<h3>Testing negative</h3>

<p>If the test is negative, you can continue with your visit and have physical contact with the person you are visiting.</p>

<p>You will still need to follow other restrictions while moving around the prison like wearing a mask and social distancing if the prison requires you to do so.</p>

<h3>Testing positive</h3>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19 by LFD test at home you must self-isolate and follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">this guidance</a>. You should also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">book a PCR test</a>.</p>

<p>Your visit will be postponed until after your isolation period ends.</p>

<p>The prison will speak to the person in custody who was expecting a visit and a postponed visit won’t have any impact on an individual’s visit allocation.</p>
