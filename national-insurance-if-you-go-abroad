      <p>You might be able to pay UK National Insurance while you’re working abroad, depending on where you’re working and how long for.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You’ll protect your State Pension and entitlement to other benefits and allowances if you keep paying National Insurance while you’re abroad.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="working-in-the-eea">Working in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>If you work in another country in the <a href="/eu-eea">EU or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr></a>, what you need to do depends on your situation. The same rules apply to Switzerland.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-work-for-an-employer-in-the-eea">If you work for an employer in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You’ll normally pay social security contributions in the <a href="/eu-eea"><abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country</a> you work in instead of National Insurance. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ll be covered by that country’s social security laws and may be entitled to benefits there</li>
  <li>your entitlement to benefits in the UK (for example State Pension) may be affected as there’ll be a gap in your National Insurance contributions</li>
</ul>

<p>You may still get <a href="/working-abroad/healthcare-and-insurance">free or reduced cost medical treatment</a> in the country where you’re working.</p>

<h3 id="if-your-uk-employer-sends-you-to-work-in-the-eea">If your UK employer sends you to work in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You might be able to carry on paying National Insurance if you’re abroad for up to 2 years. This means you won’t have to pay social security contributions abroad.</p>

<p>You’ll need to get a ‘Portable Document A1’ as proof. You or your employer can check if you can get one by completing <a href="/government/publications/national-insurance-employees-going-to-work-in-the-european-economic-area-ca3822">form CA3822</a>.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>This process can take several weeks if your employer has not previously sent <a href="/government/publications/national-insurance-sending-employees-to-work-abroad-ca3821">form CA3821</a> to tell <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> about sending employees abroad.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="if-youre-self-employed-in-the-eea">If you’re self-employed in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You might be able to carry on paying National Insurance if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>usually self-employed in the UK</li>
  <li>working abroad temporarily (for up to 2 years)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can, you won’t have to pay social security contributions in the country where you’re working.</p>

<p>You’ll need to get a ‘Portable Document A1’ as proof. To check if you can get one, fill in <a href="/government/publications/national-insurance-application-for-form-e101-if-self-employed-in-european-economic-area-ca3837">form CA3837</a> and send it to the address on the form. If you’re the director of your own limited company, fill in <a href="/government/publications/national-insurance-employees-going-to-work-in-the-european-economic-area-ca3822">form CA3822</a> instead.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-work-in-2-or-more-eea-countries">If you work in 2 or more <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries</h3>

<p>You might be able to carry on paying National Insurance if you’re employed or self-employed in 2 or more <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries (including the UK and another <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> country). If you can, you won’t have to pay social security contributions in the other <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries where you’re working.</p>

<p>You’ll need to get a ‘Portable Document A1’ as proof. </p>

<p>You can check whether you can get a ‘Portable Document A1’ or if you need to pay social security contributions abroad instead. How you do this depends on whether you live:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the UK - fill in <a href="/government/publications/national-insurance-working-in-2-or-more-countries-in-the-european-economic-area-ca8421i">form CA8421i</a>
</li>
  <li>in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> - check with the country’s social security authority</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-in-countries-with-bilateral-social-security-agreements">Working in countries with bilateral Social Security agreements</h2>

<p>If you start working for an employer in a country with a Reciprocal Agreement or Double Contribution Convention (sometimes called ‘bilateral Social Security agreements’), you’ll usually pay social security contributions in that country instead of National Insurance.</p>

<p>These countries are:</p>

<p>Barbados, Bermuda, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Guernsey, Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Jersey, the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, Mauritius, Montenegro, New Zealand, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Serbia, Turkey, USA.</p>

<p>You might be able to continue paying contributions to the UK instead of the country you’re posted to if you’re sent there temporarily by your UK employer. Your employer can check this by completing <a href="/government/publications/national-insurance-certificate-of-continuing-liability-working-abroad-ca9107">form CA9107</a>.</p>

<p>This may affect your <a href="/working-abroad/healthcare-and-insurance">entitlement to healthcare</a> and other benefits - ask your employer for more details.</p>

<h3 id="if-youre-self-employed">If you’re self-employed</h3>

<p>You might be able to carry on paying National Insurance if you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>usually self-employed in the UK</li>
  <li>working abroad temporarily</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do, you won’t have to pay social security contributions in the country where you’re working.</p>

<p>You can check this by completing <a href="/government/publications/national-insurance-certificate-of-continuing-liability-working-abroad-ca9107">form CA9107</a>.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-any-other-country">Working in any other country</h2>

<p>You’ll carry on paying National Insurance for the first 52 weeks you’re abroad if you’re working for an employer outside the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>, Switzerland and bilateral Social Security agreement countries, and you meet the following 3 conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your employer has a place of business in the UK</li>
  <li>you’re ordinarily resident in the UK</li>
  <li>you were living in the UK immediately before starting work abroad</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="if-youre-self-employed-1">If you’re self-employed</h3>

<p>You don’t need to pay Class 2 National Insurance, but you can carry on paying it if you want to protect your State Pension and benefit entitlement, as long as you meet certain conditions. <a href="/contact/hm-revenue-customs/national-insurance-enquiries-for-non-uk-residents">Contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr></a> to find out if you’re eligible.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-work-for-the-uk-government-or-armed-forces">If you work for the UK government or armed forces</h2>

<p>You’ll usually pay National Insurance if you’re working abroad and you’re one of the following:</p>

  <li>working in an embassy, consular post or diplomatic mission - or working for someone who does</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="voluntary-contributions">Voluntary contributions</h2>

<p>If you’re eligible you can pay <a href="/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/who-can-pay-voluntary-contributions">voluntary National Insurance contributions</a> that go towards your State Pension and certain benefits and allowances if you return to the UK.</p>
