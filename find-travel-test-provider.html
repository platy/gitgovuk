      <h3>Booking an arrival PCR test</h3>
<p>You must book and pay for an arrival PCR test (also known as a ‘day 2 test’) to take when you arrive in the UK.</p>

<p>You cannot use a free NHS test as your arrival PCR test.</p>

<p>You must include the booking reference from your arrival PCR test on your <a href="/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">passenger locator form</a>.</p>

<h3>Booking a pre-departure test</h3>
<p>You cannot use this service to book a pre-departure test if you’re travelling to the UK. You must <a href="/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england">get a test from a private provider in the country you’re travelling from</a> instead.</p>

<h3>Tests to travel abroad to another country</h3>

<p>Check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">foreign travel advice</a> to see what tests you need to take and any other requirements.</p>

<h3>If you’ve ordered tests and there’s a problem</h3>

<p>Contact your test provider to get help with the tests you’ve ordered. For example, if they have not arrived or you do not have your results.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://enquiries.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/s/enquiries" rel="external">make a complaint about a test provider</a>. This will help improve the service.</p>

<p>The government cannot contact a test provider for you.</p>
