      <h3>&nbsp;If you’re travelling to England</h3>

<p>Everyone entering England from abroad must take a test for coronavirus on arrival.</p>

<p>You may have to take more than one test. The tests you need to take depend on whether or not you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">qualify as fully vaccinated for travel to England</a>.</p>

<p>You must book your tests before you travel and leave enough time for them to be delivered to your address in England.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>If you’ve been in a red list country or territory in the 10 days before you arrive in England, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">follow different testing and quarantine rules</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>If you’re travelling to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>There are different rules to follow if you’re travelling to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Find out what you need to do:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Test to Release</h3>

<p>You can take an extra test to leave quarantine early using the Test to Release scheme if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re arriving in England from a country that is not on the red list</li>
  <li>you are not fully vaccinated</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tests to travel abroad to another country</h3>

<p>Check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">foreign travel advice</a> to see what tests you need to take and any other requirements.</p>

<h3>If you’ve ordered tests and there’s a problem</h3>

<p>Contact your test provider to get help with the tests you’ve ordered. For example, if they have not arrived or you do not have your results.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://enquiries.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/s/enquiries">make a complaint about a test provider</a>.</p>

<p>This will help us to improve the service. We will not be able to contact a provider on your behalf.</p>
