      <p>You do not need to take any coronavirus (COVID-19) tests when travelling to the UK. This applies whether you are fully vaccinated or not.</p>

<p>Check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">foreign travel advice</a> to find out what tests you need to travel to another country.</p>

<h2>If you’ve ordered tests and there’s a problem</h2>

<p>Contact your test provider to get help with the tests you’ve ordered. For example, if they have not arrived or you do not have your results.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://enquiries.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/s/enquiries" rel="external">make a complaint about a test provider</a>.</p>

<p>The government cannot contact a test provider for you.</p>
