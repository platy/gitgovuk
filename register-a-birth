<p>You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They’ll give you a local birth certificate.</p>
</div>

<p>This local birth certificate should be accepted in the UK, eg when you apply for a passport or register with a school or doctor. You might need to have it <a href="https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document">translated and certified</a> if it isn’t in English.</p>

<p>Once you’ve registered locally you may also be able to register the birth with the UK authorities. You can only do this if the child was born on or after 1 January 1983.</p>

<p>You don’t need to register with the UK authorities but it means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the birth will be recorded with the General Register Offices or at the National Records Office of Scotland</li>
  <li>you can order a consular birth registration certificate</li>
</ul>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You can still <a href="/apply-renew-passport">apply for a UK passport for your child</a> even if you don’t register the birth in the UK.</p>
