    <h2>Before you start</h2>
    <p>For cars registered before 1 March 2001 the rate of vehicle tax depends on its engine size.</p>

<p>The rate for cars registered on or after 1 March 2001 depends on <abbr title="Carbon Dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions and fuel type. Theyâ€™ll be taxed using the old system if this information is not available.</p>

<p>Vehicle tax rates for cars, motorcycles, light goods vehicles and trades licences are also shown in the <a href="/vehicle-tax-rate-tables">vehicle tax rate tables</a>.</p>
