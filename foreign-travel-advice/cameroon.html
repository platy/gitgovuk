<p>Before you travel, <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/entry-requirements#entry-rules-in-response-to-coronavirus-covid-19">check the ‘Entry requirements’ section</a> for Cameroon’s current entry restrictions and requirements. These may change with little warning. Monitor this advice for the latest updates and stay in contact with your travel provider.</p>

<p>Check what you must do to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-abroad-from-england-during-coronavirus-covid-19">travel abroad</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">return to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re planning travel to Cameroon, find out what you need to know about coronavirus there in the <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/coronavirus">Coronavirus section</a>.</p>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. See the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr>’s <a href="/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance">guidance on foreign travel insurance</a>.</p>

<p>For information about COVID-19 vaccines, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/coronavirus#covid-19-vaccines-if-you-live-in-cameroon">Coronavirus page</a>.</p>

<p>You should read this travel advice in full, noting the areas to which the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr> advises against all or all but essential travel. The <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to the host cities of Limbe and Garoua. You should pay close attention to our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security">Safety and security advice</a> if you plan to travel to Cameroon.

<p>General strikes (or ‘ghost towns’) are called in the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions for each Monday, with additional days often called in particular periods including February, May and October. Violence and travel disruption is regularly reported on these days. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are increasingly being used by non-state armed groups and have previously been used to target civilians in the North West and South West regions. There have also been a number of reported civilian fatalities in these regions at or near checkpoints due to accidental discharge of weapons.  If you decide to travel to, or within, areas of the North West and South West regions where the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel or all but essential travel, you should consider carefully the risks of travel, monitor developments closely, keep a low profile and minimise your movements. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security">North West and South West (Anglophone) regions</a></p>

<p>Political developments and increased tensions related to the North West and South West (Anglophone) regions could lead to isolated incidents of violence in other parts of the country. This could affect western interests, as well as places frequented by foreigners. You should enhance your vigilance and plan your movements carefully. In November 2020, a threat was made against diplomatic missions in Yaoundé, including the British High Commission. You should remain vigilant when moving around the city.</p>

<p>On 2 July 2022, an IED was detonated at Mokolo market in Yaoundé. Four people were injured in the explosion. On the 12 July 2022, another IED was detonated at the Mokolo Market in Yaounde, injuring one person.</p>

<p>This follows small IEDs being detonated in populated areas of Yaoundé and Douala between June 2020 and February 2021. It is possible that more attacks will occur in urban areas, or other locations around the country, in the future. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with developments via the media and local authorities. See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security#political-situation">Political situation</a></p>

<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Cameroon, particularly in the Far North region. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners such as restaurants, bars, markets, hotels, shopping centres and places of worship. The terrorist group Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) is active in the Far North region but attacks could occur anywhere, potentially including major towns and cities such as Yaoundé and Douala. There have been numerous suicide attacks since 2015, which have resulted in over 200 dead in the Far North region, although since 2017 these have been predominately adjacent to the border with Nigeria. Key targets have been large open markets, hotels, parks and sporting venues. There have also been hostages taken and heavy gunfights reported in Babouang and Mbarang in Adamawa region (Cameroon). See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/terrorism">Terrorism</a></p>

<p>There is a heightened threat of kidnap to western nationals in the north of Cameroon, including in the major cities and along the border between the Far North region and Nigeria.
Boko Haram has publicly threatened Cameroon with attacks and further kidnappings due to Cameroon’s involvement in the regional fight to counter Boko Haram.</p>

<p>There have been reports of criminality including large armed gangs and highway bandits, stopping travellers, taking hostages and demanding payment, particularly in the east of Cameroon, close to the Central African Republic (CAR) border. There are frequent instances of violence in CAR spilling across the border to Cameroon and following the disputed election result in CAR in December 2020, and consequent insecurity in that country, there is now an even greater likelihood of this occurring. See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/cameroon/safety-and-security#crime">Crime</a></p>

<p>Nigerian military operations in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa in Nigeria could have an impact across the border in Cameroon.</p>

<p>Avoid travelling at night across Cameroon unless absolutely necessary, due to risks from criminality, poor infrastructure and erratic driving.</p>

<p>UK health authorities have classified Cameroon as having a risk of Zika virus transmission. For information and advice about the risks associated with Zika virus, visit the <a href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/40/cameroon#Other_risks" rel="external">National Travel Health Network and Centre website</a>.</p>

<p>There are increased reports of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. Take great care when travelling in coastal waters, including the coastline of Cameroon and the Doula port.
Despite the high crime levels, most visits to Cameroon are trouble-free. Only a few British nationals needed consular assistance in the past year.</p>

<p>If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>. Consular support is severely limited in parts of Cameroon (particularly East, Far North, North-West and South-West).</p>
