      <h3 id="crime">Crime</h3>
<p>For assistance in any emergency situation, dial 112.</p>

<p>Take sensible precautions against street and car crime. Don’t keep your passport, credit cards and other valuables in the same place; use the inside compartments in bags where possible. Carry your bag across your body rather than on your shoulder.</p>

<p>Pickpockets can work in gangs: one to distract you while the other one goes into your bag. Keep your belongings close to you in restaurants and bars. Don’t be distracted around tourist attractions and cash points.</p>

<p>Be aware of common scams used to obtain money from tourists, there are petition, 3 card trick and gold ring tricks which are all to be avoided, more information can be found <a rel="external" href="http://www.prefecturedepolice.interieur.gouv.fr/English/Advice/Advice/Advice-for-tourists-FAQ">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thieves and pickpockets operate on the Paris underground, RER lines and at mainline stations, for example Gare du Nord.</p>

<p>There have been several victims of serious assault on the RER line B, which serves Paris Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports and Paris Gare du Nord Eurostar terminus. There have also been serious assaults on RER line D, which serves the Stade de France.</p>

<p>Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. If you’re going to drink, know your limit and take sensible precautions such as not becoming separated from friends.</p>

<p>Motorway journeys are usually trouble-free, but if you’re asked by another motorist to stop and you decide to do so, park your car in a public area with lights - like a service station. If you’re involved in a car accident or witness an accident on the motorway, use the <a rel="external" href="http://www.autoroutes.fr/en/accidents.htm">orange emergency phones</a> to ask for help.</p>

<h3 id="hiking-winter-sports-and-outdoor-activities">Hiking, winter sports and outdoor activities</h3>
<p>Check weather forecasts and conditions and make sure you’re properly equipped. Don’t undertake any activity alone, and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone. For travel to mountainous areas, make sure your insurance covers you for extra medical costs, repatriation to your country of residence and in the départements of Savoie and Haute-Savoie possible transfer to Switzerland for treatment.</p>

<p>Observe all warnings regarding avalanches and where appropriate consider carrying avalanche search equipment. You can check the latest avalanche risk areas on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.meteoalarm.eu/en_UK/0/0/FR-France.html">Meteo Alarm website.</a> Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. You should carry water, food, warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle.</p>

<p>For sports activities like skiing, potholing and mountaineering, and for sports classed as particularly dangerous (eg off-piste skiing, snow-boarding, mountain biking, climbing, ice-climbing, paragliding), make sure you’re covered by your insurance. This should include mountain rescue services and helicopter costs.</p>

<p>Read more about how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes">stay safe on the slopes</a>.</p>

<p>Local sea conditions can endanger even strong swimmers on the Atlantic Coast. Many beaches provide lifeguards and warning systems (coloured flags) and you should always follow the advice closely. Get information on the specific Baïne danger on the coast of the Gironde and Landes departments from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.gironde.gouv.fr/Media/Politiques-publiques/Mer-littoral-securite-maritime/Baines-2013-english">Gironde Prefecture website.</a></p>

<p>Follow local advice if jellyfish are present in the sea.</p>

<h3 id="road-travel">Road travel</h3>

<p>To drive in France you must be 18 years old and have a valid UK driving licence, insurance and vehicle documents. If you don’t own the vehicle you’re driving, you should get written permission from the registered owner.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, you may need to get an International Driving Permit (IDP) to be able to drive in France and other EU/EEA countries as a visitor.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of IDP. Check that you have the correct permits covering all countries where you will be driving - you may need more than one IDP. For full information, check this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-driving-permits-for-uk-drivers-from-28-march-2019#what-type-of-idp-will-i-need">guidance page</a>. You should also check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prepare-to-drive-in-the-eu-after-brexit">guidance on driving in the EU after Brexit</a> for information on other additional documents you may need to carry.</p>

<p>If you’re living in France, check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/overseas-living-in-guides">Living in Guide</a> for information on requirements for residents.</p>

<p>Driving regulations in France are different from those in the UK. Always remember that the normal rule is to give way to the right each time you reach an intersection.</p>

<p>Using mobile phones with headsets or ear pieces when driving is forbidden.</p>

<p>Speeding can result in heavy, on the spot fines, and your vehicle and licence could be confiscated. The maximum speed on autoroutes is 130kph (80mph) in good weather and 110kph (68mph) in poor weather.</p>

<p>Many drivers undertake long journeys in France. Plan your journey carefully, taking into account unknown roads, weather conditions and fatigue.  Make sure you take regular breaks.</p>

<p>Information on road safety and potential traffic black spots (in French only) is available on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bison-fute.gouv.fr/index.html">Bison Futé website</a>. Alternatively, real-time information on road traffic conditions is available on 107.7 FM in French and in English (Motorways radio – Autoroute Info).</p>

<p>It’s compulsory to carry a warning triangle and reflective jacket. The reflective jacket must be stored inside the vehicle itself and accessible without getting out of the car. It is illegal to cross, even partially, on to the hard shoulder of a motorway without good reason.</p>

<p>Keep vehicle doors locked in slow moving traffic and secure your vehicle when it is left unattended.</p>

<p>In-car radar detectors and satellite navigation systems warning of the presence of speed cameras or radars are illegal whether in use or not.</p>

<p>In 2017 there were 3,448 road deaths in France (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras52-international-comparisons">source: Department for Transport</a>). This equates to 5.1 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.8 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2017.</p>

<p>See the <a rel="external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/going_abroad/index_en.htm">European Commission</a>, <a rel="external" href="http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/overseas/countrybycountry.html">AA</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.rac.co.uk/driving-abroad">RAC</a> guides on driving in France.</p>

<h3 id="road-hauliers">Road hauliers</h3>

<p>There have been reports of burglaries taking place while lorry drivers have been asleep in their vehicles. Avoid parking in isolated or dark areas of unsupervised camping grounds or car parks. Consider installing an alarm in your vehicle.</p>

<p>There have been many attempts by illegal migrants to enter lorries while stationary or in slow moving traffic. Take sensible precautions against attempts to break in to your vehicle.</p>

<p>Heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes are banned from driving on roads in France on certain days during the year, including all Sundays and public holidays. Dates are set by the French Ministry of Transport. Full details of restrictions can be found on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.bison-fute.equipement.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/_EN_Brochure_vehicules_lourds_2011_DEF_WEB_cle743294.pdf">Bison Futé website</a>.</p>

<p>British haulage companies and their employees should contact the <a rel="external" href="http://www.rha.uk.net/">Road Hauliers Association</a> for further information about driving in France.</p>

<h3 id="camping-cars">Camping Cars</h3>

<p>There have been reports of burglaries taking place while travellers have been asleep in their caravans, mobile homes and other vehicles. Avoid parking in isolated or dark areas of unsupervised camping grounds or car parks and consider installing an alarm in your caravan or mobile home.</p>

<p>There have been many attempts by illegal migrants to enter vehicles while stationary or in slow moving traffic. Take sensible precautions against break in to your vehicle, particularly in Northern France.</p>

<h3 id="public-transport">Public transport</h3>
<p>Travel to and within France can be disrupted by strike action. Check with your travel provider before you travel.</p>

<p>If you use an individual paper ticket on the bus or on trains, make sure you validate it in the machine on the bus or in the station. If you don’t validate your ticket, you may be fined.</p>

<h3 id="first-world-war-centenary-commemorations">First World War Centenary Commemorations</h3>
<p>If you’re travelling to commemorate the First World War centenary, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-world-war-centenary-advice-for-travellers">this information and advice page</a> to help plan your trip and make sure it’s safe and trouble free. Some sites will become extremely busy at certain times of the year, and some may have access restrictions.</p>
